| 00:00      | Hello and welcome to Automators, the automation podcast where we get nerdy, we get automated          |
| 00:07      | and we make magic happen.                                                                             |
| 00:08      | My name is Rosemary Orchard and I'm joined as always by David Sparks.                                 |

| 00:17      | Do you say it like one of those truck rallies?                                                        |
| 00:20      | I don't know, gang.                                                                                   |
| 00:22      | We got some friends here, Federico.                                                                   |
| 00:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |

| 00:27      | Hey, David.                                                                                           |
| 00:28      | Hi, Rose.                                                                                             |
| 00:29      | Thanks.                                                                                               |
| 00:30      | Thank you.                                                                                            |
| 00:31      | Thank you for having us.                                                                              |
| 00:32      | Yeah, no worries.                                                                                     |
| 00:33      | Thank you for coming.                                                                                 |
| 00:34      | Do you say Automation April like a truck rally?                                                       |
| 00:36      | Is that how you guys do it?                                                                           |
| 00:37      | What is a truck rally?                                                                                |
| 00:39      | We haven't been, but I think we should.                                                               |
| 00:40      | I think especially Federico being from Italy, he's, you know.                                         |
| 00:43      | I share, Rose, his question, like what is a truck rally?                                              |
| 00:46      | Is a truck rally, is a truck rally?                                                                   |
| 00:48      | Is there a NASCAR race involved?                                                                      |
| 00:49      | No, it's a, they call them, I've never been to one, but they call them monster truck                  |
| 00:53      | rallies and these people build these trucks with the.                                                 |
| 00:56      | I have been to one, David.                                                                            |
| 00:58      | I've actually been to a monster truck rally just once in my life and they're actually                 |
| 01:02      | kind of fun to do once, you know, you see giant trucks drive around in a stadium and                  |
| 01:07      | crush other cars and trucks and race around in circles.                                               |
| 01:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:12      | It's very loud, very, very.                                                                           |
| 01:13      | It's very American.                                                                                   |
| 01:14      | Very American.                                                                                        |
| 01:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:16      | So basically we just need to introduce Automation April with hype is what you're saying, David.       |
| 01:21      | Yeah, lots of hype.                                                                                   |
| 01:22      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:23      | I believe, I would assume there's a lot of like fried food at a truck rally, right?                   |
| 01:26      | Oh yeah.                                                                                              |
| 01:27      | Very much so.                                                                                         |
| 01:28      | But the announcer always like has that Automation April, kind of like the, like a roaring engine      |
| 01:34      | kind of thing.                                                                                        |
| 01:35      | I feel like that, that's the way I feel about Automation April, but that's why we're here             |
| 01:37      | today, gang.                                                                                          |
| 01:38      | Before we get started though, just a couple of quick announcements.                                   |
| 01:41      | I'm doing a calendar webinar on April 21st and I've been really getting serious with                  |
| 01:46      | my calendar now.                                                                                      |
| 01:47      | I've got some really weird automation stuff I'm doing with my calendar.                               |
| 01:51      | It's a free webinar, April 21st.                                                                      |
| 01:52      | I'll put a link in the show notes if you want to join us for that.                                    |
| 01:55      | But the reason we had John and Federico here today is they had this great idea and over               |
| 02:00      | a max story is through the whole month, they're sharing Automation workflow as well.                  |
| 02:04      | In fact, you guys tell us about it.                                                                   |
| 02:06      | What is Automation April?                                                                             |
| 02:07      | Well, can I go first, John, and then go for it.                                                       |
| 02:11      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 02:12      | So I've been rehearsing my pitch for Automation April many times.                                     |
| 02:16      | He's very good at it.                                                                                 |
| 02:18      | Thank you.                                                                                            |
| 02:19      | Well, I hope I don't, I don't blow it now.                                                            |
| 02:21      | So our idea was we actually came to this idea starting from a couple of different points.             |
| 02:30      | First of all, we really wanted to find a way to celebrate the Automation community.                   |
| 02:34      | We wanted to put together a special event at the time of year when usually there's not                |
| 02:41      | a ton of Apple news.                                                                                  |
| 02:42      | And I mean, sure, we just got the [[WWDC]] announcement, but the March event from Apple has passed        |
| 02:49      | and now there's usually those couple of months when everybody's just waiting for June.                |
| 02:54      | And so we thought, can we do something pretty cool here for max stories readers?                      |
| 02:59      | And what can it be?                                                                                   |
| 03:01      | And of course, the idea of doing something related to Automation sounded like an ideal                |
| 03:06      | candidate for us because we write about shortcuts, we share shortcuts, we love Automation and         |
| 03:13      | we use it, we use shortcuts on every device every day.                                                |
| 03:17      | So it felt like a like a nice match for Mac stories, but more than that, we also wanted               |
| 03:24      | to put the spotlight on on creators, on people who can use shortcuts on Apple devices, especially     |
| 03:33      | now that it's also available on Mac OS and use shortcuts to create just cool stuff, cool              |
| 03:39      | things, useful workflows, useful automations.                                                         |
| 03:43      | And to put the spotlight on those people doing so in a way that we can go beyond what we              |
| 03:49      | usually cover, what John and I usually cover, because I'm sure there are hundreds, thousands          |
| 03:55      | of use cases for shortcuts that we cannot possibly imagine.                                           |
| 03:59      | And lastly, we wanted to try our hand at running a month long event, which we've never done           |
| 04:07      | before, and to see whether we could do like the full package, if you will, like, can we               |
| 04:13      | do an event where every single thing, every single property of this sort of Mac stories               |
| 04:19      | universe that we have has something about shortcuts for a whole month.                                |
| 04:24      | So whether it's Mac stories or the podcast or club Mac stories for members or the discord,            |
| 04:31      | can we do at least one thing for each of these places?                                                |
| 04:35      | And so that was our pitch for Automation April.                                                        |
| 04:38      | And then of course, we added a contest on top of it, because healthy competition is fun,              |
| 04:44      | is good, and we want to see what people come up with.                                                 |
| 04:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 04:48      | I mean, and it is, you're delivering as we record this, we've just got started on April               |
| 04:52      | and there's a ton of great content coming down.                                                       |
| 04:55      | But the thing you just said that really resonates with me is this idea that there are thousands       |
| 05:02      | of people making shortcuts that you've never thought of.                                              |
| 05:04      | And that's really the idea of it, right?                                                              |
| 05:07      | I mean, I feel like, you know, the whole point of automation is that everybody automates              |
| 05:13      | on a basis that works for them.                                                                       |
| 05:16      | And, you know, I mean, and, and I really, I mean, the whole reason this show exists                   |
| 05:21      | is I feel like everybody can automate, you know, you don't have to make it a 200 step                 |
| 05:27      | shortcut in order to be an automator, you can make a two step shortcut.                               |
| 05:30      | And if it solves a problem for you, you're an automator.                                              |
| 05:33      | And I love that you're kind of like putting a spotlight on that idea.                                 |
| 05:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 05:37      | That's really important to us because, you know, as much as Federico and I try to put                 |
| 05:42      | ourselves in the shoes of other people using shortcuts and design shortcuts to share that             |
| 05:48      | we think are appealing to a broad audience, there's still so many other use cases, as                 |
| 05:54      | Federico said, that are just not things that he and I do in our everyday lives.                       |
| 05:59      | And this way we're going to have, you know, there, there's a kind of a forum for a much               |
| 06:04      | broader audience to, to share what they've created and get it out to a, you know, a bigger            |
| 06:10      | readership and bigger audience.                                                                       |
| 06:12      | Now is it just based on shortcuts or are you looking at other automation platforms?                   |
| 06:17      | Well, that's, that's a good question.                                                                 |
| 06:19      | So initially we thought we should include any kind of automation utility for any kind                 |
| 06:27      | of platform.                                                                                          |
| 06:28      | That was like the starting idea.                                                                      |
| 06:30      | But then we realised if we're going to run a contest for this and we need a set of boundaries         |
| 06:35      | and we need a set of rules, well, it just becomes a little too much, you know, when                   |
| 06:40      | you're asking a group of 10 people, you know, our judges, including both of you, in fact,             |
| 06:45      | like we're just 10 people and we are expecting, you know, many shortcuts submitted by folks.          |
| 06:50      | It just becomes impossible to say, well, okay, this is a shortcut.                                    |
| 06:54      | This is a [[Keyboard Maestro]] utility.                                                                   |
| 06:55      | This is an [[Alfred]] workflow.                                                                           |
| 06:56      | And look, there's also the guy who came up with the Python script.                                    |
| 07:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 07:01      | Right.                                                                                                |
| 07:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 07:03      | And went across the line into programming, you know, it gets blurry there in spots.                   |
| 07:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 07:08      | I think you're doing it right.                                                                        |
| 07:10      | And it's also just kind of a fortuitous time because I feel like shortcuts is, you know,              |
| 07:15      | it's had a rough beginning on the Mac, but it's getting to a good place right now.                    |
| 07:19      | So this is like the perfect time to be doing this.                                                    |
| 07:22      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 07:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 07:24      | And one of the recent updates, I think there was 15.3 that they had the updates where they've         |
| 07:28      | just tweaked some of the names of some of the actions slightly and all of those icons                 |
| 07:33      | as well.                                                                                              |
| 07:34      | And I'm fixed, fortunately, finally, a number of small but aggravating bugs that were hanging         |
| 07:39      | around in macOS.                                                                                      |
| 07:40      | So it's excellent timing from that perspective as well.                                               |
| 07:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 07:44      | Well, it really is a good, I was going to say, it's a really good time to jump in because             |
| 07:47      | I know last summer as I was working on the betas for Monterey, I was very disappointed                |
| 07:52      | only because I was so excited to dig into shortcuts for Mac.                                          |
| 07:56      | And I really just kind of put it aside for a while until it got a little more stable.                 |
| 08:00      | And I've been using it regularly now since Monterey was released, but it really has been,             |
| 08:05      | as you said, Rose, been the last month or two when it's really started to come into                   |
| 08:09      | its own and be something that you can work in without too many frustrations.                          |
| 08:13      | Yeah, precisely.                                                                                      |
| 08:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 08:15      | It really energised us if you will.                                                                   |
| 08:18      | This arrival of shortcuts on the Mac, even, you know, despite the problems that we saw                |
| 08:24      | last year on our platforms, really, and especially the Mac, it feels like it's really breathing       |
| 08:31      | new life into the community in us, even like, I think I also speak for John here.                     |
| 08:39      | We're going through this really creative period for automation and shortcuts in our                   |
| 08:44      | own personal use cases, which is a good sign because it means that Apple is giving us the             |
| 08:49      | tools to come up with new ideas and to share them with people.                                        |
| 08:53      | And so the timing was right, you know, for us and for shortcuts, Apple is still continuing            |
| 09:00      | to fix problems, so that's also a good sign.                                                          |
| 09:04      | And honestly, and, you know, we had nothing else to do.                                               |
| 09:09      | True.                                                                                                 |
| 09:10      | I find that hard to believe the amount of content that the entire [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/) team                    |
| 09:15      | produce, of course, you two in particular, it feels like you must have a never-ending                 |
| 09:19      | list of things to do, so I'm sure you have plenty of options.                                         |
| 09:23      | We have many ideas.                                                                                   |
| 09:24      | We have many ideas.                                                                                   |
| 09:27      | Thank you.                                                                                            |
| 09:28      | Yes, we have many ideas, but April and May tend to be slow months, also because like                  |
| 09:37      | developers, for example, indie developers especially, they tend to, at this point, they               |
| 09:44      | tend to wait for [[WWDC]] before releasing new apps.                                                      |
| 09:48      | So that's why you get the influx of new indie apps in September, October through November,            |
| 09:53      | maybe, because that's when developers are implementing all the features from [[WWDC]].                    |
| 09:59      | But then when it's springtime, everybody's like, well, you know, do I really want to                  |
| 10:04      | release a brand new product right now?                                                                |
| 10:06      | I guess I'm just going to wait for June and see what happens.                                         |
| 10:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 10:09      | Yeah, it makes sense.                                                                                 |
| 10:10      | And also, people who are indie developers, if they're going to take time off, like now                |
| 10:15      | is a pretty good time to take some time off of whatever your app is, so that you're rested            |
| 10:20      | and refreshed, ready for whatever Apple dump on you at [[WWDC]], be that a thousand new features          |
| 10:25      | you can implement, or, oh, I'm going to go rework this area of my app now that there                  |
| 10:30      | has been some refactoring involved in how everything that I'm using works, as I'm sure                |
| 10:35      | more than one developer has encountered in the past, which is good.                                   |
| 10:40      | But do either of you have any particular idea or wish that you would immediately like to              |
| 10:45      | see four shortcuts at [[WWDC]] this year, speaking of the event that was just announced?                  |
| 10:51      | Oh, boy.                                                                                              |
| 10:52      | So many.                                                                                              |
| 10:53      | So many.                                                                                              |
| 10:54      | Okay, I can hear the thump of what sounds like a very large set of his, like, Encyclopedia                 |
| 10:58      | landing on a desk.                                                                                    |
| 11:00      | Right.                                                                                                |
| 11:01      | Well, Federico and I do an episode of App Stories every year where we do our shortcuts                |
| 11:07      | wishes, and there are some on there that have been on there for a very long time.                     |
| 11:13      | And I don't know.                                                                                     |
| 11:14      | I would start with, first of all, I think, I hope this year is more of a tightening down              |
| 11:21      | everything that's still a little loose kind of year.                                                  |
| 11:24      | That said, though, I think there are a lot of kind of quality of life things that could               |
| 11:28      | be added to shortcuts on all platforms that would make creators' lives a lot easier.                  |
| 11:34      | And one of the things that's at the top of my list is tagging and subfolders, because                 |
| 11:39      | this is something I run into all the time.                                                            |
| 11:40      | I have, you know, various folders of my shortcuts, but there are things that really fit into          |
| 11:45      | multiple categories, and having a tagging system would make it so much easier to have                 |
| 11:50      | a tag for widgets, say, for the things that I want to show up in the widget on my iPad's              |
| 11:54      | home screen.                                                                                          |
| 11:56      | But it also happens to be related to, you know, Club Mac stories.                                     |
| 12:00      | So I want to see it when I'm sorting that way as well, filtering that way as well.                    |
| 12:05      | So I think another layer of organisation would go a long way with shortcuts.                          |
| 12:11      | Fair enough.                                                                                          |
| 12:12      | Federico, what about you?                                                                             |
| 12:13      | I'm sure you've got a list.                                                                           |
| 12:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 12:16      | I'm just going to mention, too, I love to run shortcuts on my iPad as quickly as I can                |
| 12:22      | on the Mac.                                                                                           |
| 12:23      | Especially since on my MacBook, I started using [[Raycast]], but it's, you know, the same                 |
| 12:28      | applies if you're using [[LaunchBar]], I think, or [[Alfred]].                                                |
| 12:32      | It's really fast to, you know, you really run shortcuts by typing their name, and especially          |
| 12:38      | these utilities that have fuzzy search built in, you can just type a few letters and press            |
| 12:43      | return and run a shortcut immediately from anywhere.                                                  |
| 12:47      | And even if you spend the time, and I've done that, to configure spotlight on the iPad to             |
| 12:54      | disable the kind of content sources that, you know, are polluting your results, even                  |
| 13:01      | if you trim down that list, running shortcuts is either kind of slow or just not as reliable          |
| 13:07      | as these launchers on the Mac, because sometimes it happens to me basically on a daily basis.         |
| 13:13      | I type the exact name of a shortcut.                                                                  |
| 13:16      | So not even fuzzy search, but the exact name and spotlight on the iPad just doesn't find              |
| 13:21      | it for whatever reason.                                                                               |
| 13:24      | So that's not great.                                                                                  |
| 13:25      | And, you know, I would love to see a better spotlight integration, but also system-wide               |
| 13:30      | keyboard shortcuts, system-wide hotkeys for triggering shortcuts on the iPad.                         |
| 13:34      | Because there's already the accessibility feature, right, where different buttons on                  |
| 13:37      | a mouse can trigger shortcuts and various other useful utilities as well, which is great.             |
| 13:43      | But yeah, it would be great if they could expand that to a few other things too.                      |
| 13:46      | Yeah, and the second thing I would mention is for personal automations, I would love                  |
| 13:53      | to see an API or, you know, a developer framework of some kind for third-party triggers.              |
| 14:00      | So let third-party apps define a set of conditions that can trigger an automation in shortcuts.       |
| 14:08      | Like, I don't know, I just saved a draft for the article that I'm working on in IA                    |
| 14:14      | writer or [[Obsidian]], or I just marked a tweet as a favourite in Tweetbot.                               |
| 14:20      | You know, once you consider, well, what if third-party apps could be triggers for automations?        |
| 14:25      | There could be so many different ideas for that, and that would be pretty awesome.                    |
| 14:30      | Yeah, and they could even limit that to things in the foreground as well.                             |
| 14:33      | So like, you have to actively be doing something so it's not like this application synced in          |
| 14:37      | the background or received that push notification or whatever, you know, then, you know, they         |
| 14:42      | can send you a push notification, you tap on it and open it, and that could run the                   |
| 14:45      | shortcut, whatever it is, because of their trigger.                                                   |
| 14:49      | That would be really great.                                                                           |
| 14:51      | David, do you have a wish, as we're on Shortcuts wishes right now?                                    |
| 14:55      | And you know, I'm sure the Shortcuts team have got plenty of time to implement all of                 |
| 14:59      | this before [[WWDC]].                                                                                     |
| 15:00      | So that's how it works.                                                                               |
| 15:01      | They listen to podcasts a couple of months before, and then they do it.                               |
| 15:04      | Yeah, and then magic happens.                                                                         |
| 15:05      | Yeah, they listen to our show, and they're like, okay, that's our list.                               |
| 15:10      | Is there such a thing as snow leopard for shortcuts?                                                  |
| 15:13      | I mean, I really, the biggest frustration for me Shortcuts right now is I advocate it.                |
| 15:19      | I make a podcast about it, I talk about it on my blog, and you know, I'm publishing Shortcuts.        |
| 15:26      | And the worst thing is when I get an email from someone who said, you know, you've been               |
| 15:30      | talking about this for years, I decided to try it, and I made this simple one, but it's               |
| 15:34      | not working, and could you help me fix it?                                                            |
| 15:37      | And then I see the shortcut they've made, and the only thing that's working that's breaking           |
| 15:41      | it is some kind of bug, you know?                                                                     |
| 15:43      | So this person's first exposure to Shortcuts is I did it right, but it still didn't work.             |
| 15:49      | And the likelihood of them doing it a second time is pretty small at that point.                      |
| 15:54      | And I think they really just need to tighten things down.                                             |
| 15:57      | And listening to Federico and John talk, it reminded me that, you know, like we do have               |
| 16:02      | this kind of disparity of features, whether it's the way you trigger them or the existence            |
| 16:07      | of triggers on the Mac, which there aren't that many, I would like to see them just kind              |
| 16:11      | of tighten things down, make the number one goal that if somebody wants to learn to do                |
| 16:17      | Shortcuts, and they make simple Shortcuts, they are going to work 1000% of the time that              |
| 16:22      | there will never be a problem.                                                                        |
| 16:25      | And then kind of balance the features between the two platforms.                                      |
| 16:29      | And like, I feel like we're still at the foundation period.                                           |
| 16:31      | You know, Craig Federighi last year said Short, you know, this was the beginning, Shortcuts           |
| 16:35      | on Mac was the beginning of their automation strategy.                                                |
| 16:37      | Well, you can't build a building without a solid foundation.                                          |
| 16:42      | And I feel like they still need some more concrete.                                                   |
| 16:44      | I think it's an important point, David, because, you know, if you're new to Shortcuts and you         |
| 16:49      | run into one of those bugs, you don't necessarily know that it's a bug.                               |
| 16:52      | You might think it's you.                                                                             |
| 16:53      | And I think that that is a big problem to expanding the audience for Shortcuts.                       |
| 16:58      | So I agree with you, I really hope that gets worked on.                                               |
| 17:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 17:03      | For me, I want unknown action to just go and die a death in a corner somewhere.                       |
| 17:08      | It feels like, I feel like this didn't used to happen as much, but it's somewhat frequent.            |
| 17:13      | I actually downloaded a Shortcut from David the other day, and I'm pretty certain it was              |
| 17:16      | an OmniFocus action.                                                                                  |
| 17:17      | And it was said it wasn't known.                                                                      |
| 17:19      | And I'm presuming that's because I was running a slightly different beta version of OmniFocus         |
| 17:22      | 4 to David.                                                                                           |
| 17:23      | But, you know, unknown action is just not helpful in any way, shape, or form.                         |
| 17:29      | You know, I'm downloading something and maybe I don't have things installed or to do this,            |
| 17:32      | but I'm trying to see what somebody is doing to solve a similar problem that they've got.             |
| 17:37      | It'd be great if I could see that action and it just sort of grayed things out and made               |
| 17:40      | it really clear this won't run because it's not on your device, but it would help with                |
| 17:44      | app discovery as well as showing people, you know, what this action is supposed to be doing           |
| 17:51      | instead of just, oh, there's an unknown action here and that area of stuff has just disappeared       |
| 17:55      | into a lovely black hole.                                                                             |
| 17:56      | Have fun.                                                                                             |
| 17:59      | It makes it a bit more difficult.                                                                     |
| 18:00      | So I'm hoping that that will be resolved and just fixing, you know, fixing some of those              |
| 18:05      | bugs that we've got with things not working or so automation is not running because they              |
| 18:09      | don't have permissions, but not telling you clearly that they don't have permissions,                 |
| 18:13      | things like that.                                                                                     |
| 18:14      | That would be great to just get sorted.                                                               |
| 18:18      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by Electric.                                             |
| 18:21      | Turning a small business into an empire takes work and you have to keep it into the ground            |
| 18:24      | for things that will take you to the next level, but that can be hard when your direction             |
| 18:28      | is pulled in different directions because that's reality of being a boss.                             |
| 18:33      | The team over at Electric knows more businesses, maybe like yours, face these challenges.             |
| 18:37      | That's why they've solved this problem for you by operating as your IT department instead             |
| 18:41      | of spending your time sorting through unused application licenses, setting up employee                |
| 18:45      | laptops and answering never ending IT questions from your team.                                       |
| 18:48      | You can build the empire.                                                                             |
| 18:50      | With Electric acting as your IT department, you can get back to what you're good at.                  |
| 18:53      | Plus you get a really cool IT platform to see and manage everything.                                  |
| 18:58      | Of course, just because you can do things doesn't mean you should.                                    |
| 19:01      | Sometimes the best case of being a boss is actually knowing when you shouldn't do something           |
| 19:06      | and you should hand it off to somebody or something else.                                             |
| 19:08      | Honestly, I would love Electric because it would allow me to just not have to deal with               |
| 19:14      | sourcing my own devices.                                                                              |
| 19:16      | And of course, that means that I wouldn't have to source them for any of the people                   |
| 19:19      | who work for me either.                                                                               |

| 19:52      | So one of the things I've been enjoying from afar, Federico, is hearing your experiences              |
| 19:57      | going back to the Mac.                                                                                |
| 19:58      | And I know shortcuts is what kind of brought you there.                                               |
| 20:01      | But how is your automation story developing on the Mac as you're using one more now?                  |
| 20:07      | Yeah, it's been a really fascinating journey after more than seven years working exclusively          |
| 20:14      | on the iPad, getting a custom again to Mac OS with this M1 Max MacBook Pro.                           |
| 20:24      | It's been a learning experience.                                                                      |
| 20:26      | I feel like I'm visiting an old house where I used to live many years ago.                            |
| 20:32      | And so some things are familiar, but some things are forgotten about.                                 |
| 20:36      | And for shortcuts has been sort of this guide that has been helping me in the process because         |
| 20:42      | all of my shortcuts that I created on the iPhone and iPad were carried over to Mac                    |
| 20:47      | OS and I've been able to continue to use them.                                                        |
| 20:51      | And so that was the first period of like, yeah, I need to learn this platform again,                  |
| 20:58      | but I have my shortcuts with me.                                                                      |
| 21:00      | And at first I was using the shortcuts very much in sort of compatibility mode, meaning               |
| 21:06      | these are they look and they behave just as they do on the iPad.                                      |
| 21:12      | These are the same shortcuts with no special modifications for Mac OS.                                |
| 21:18      | But then over time I realised I can keep using the same shortcut, but branch out in terms             |
| 21:25      | of what it looks like and what it does, depending on whether I'm using the iPad, which I still        |
| 21:30      | do, or I'm using the MacBook.                                                                         |
| 21:32      | All right.                                                                                            |
| 21:33      | Now, let me ask you a question that because there's a couple of ways to do that, right?               |
| 21:38      | Because there are actions that don't work on one platform, the other, and there's triggers            |
| 21:42      | that don't work.                                                                                      |
| 21:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 21:44      | So I know some people will do that by making a separate shortcut, one for the Mac and one             |
| 21:48      | for the iOS, or some people will use the device condition.                                            |
| 21:53      | If this is a Mac and go off in this track, I feel like neither one is really ideal.                   |
| 21:59      | How do you tackle that?                                                                               |
| 22:01      | Well, you're right.                                                                                   |
| 22:03      | Neither of them is ideal, and yet those are really the only solutions that we have at                 |
| 22:08      | the moment.                                                                                           |
| 22:09      | So if a shortcut is Mac only, so if I know that it only works on the Mac because it's                 |
| 22:14      | got like one single [[AppleScript]] action or one single shell script action, I have a Mac               |
| 22:21      | folder in shortcuts and I create, you know, Mac only shortcuts and I keep them there.                 |
| 22:27      | But most of the time I have this sort of hybrid, like multi-platform shortcuts.                       |
| 22:33      | And my preferred approach is to have the condition so to do if the device model is a Mac, do          |
| 22:40      | this, otherwise, you know, continue to do that instead.                                               |
| 22:43      | There are ways to optimise when you design a shortcut like that.                                      |
| 22:47      | So in my shortcuts, I try to deal with these conditions up front.                                     |
| 22:55      | So for example, if I need to process a [[Safari]] web page, right, instead of having these conditions     |
| 23:03      | nested like in the middle of a shortcut, I try to fix this up front at the beginning                  |
| 23:09      | of the shortcut so that I can save my variable for the selection of a web page, for example,          |
| 23:16      | right away.                                                                                           |
| 23:17      | Later, the shortcut can continue and it's the same everywhere.                                        |
| 23:21      | But usually I have this little condition at the top where it's like if device model is                |
| 23:25      | a Mac and thankfully those device details are now a built-in variable so you can easily               |
| 23:32      | pick it from the variable menu.                                                                       |
| 23:35      | I just put it there and I say if it's a Mac, do this series of steps and that's it.                   |
| 23:42      | It's a little more tricky for shortcuts that accept input from outside and that's because             |
| 23:50      | there are different ways to trigger shortcuts on the Mac, but also the share sheet is missing         |
| 23:56      | from the Mac.                                                                                         |
| 23:57      | So there was a bit of, I needed to figure this out and there are utilities like there's               |
| 24:05      | one that we covered called ShareBot that tries to simulate running a shortcut from the share          |
| 24:13      | sheet, but it works, but it's not ideal, right, because then ShareBot passes a bunch of base          |
| 24:22      | 64 text and you need to deal with that, so that's not ideal.                                          |
| 24:27      | But generally speaking, Mac-only shortcuts, I have a few of those, otherwise I have to                |
| 24:33      | use the conditions because there's really no other solution.                                          |
| 24:38      | Ideally, this wouldn't be necessary though, ideally the iPad and the Mac would all have               |
| 24:44      | the same actions, so maybe this year we'll get some of that feature parity.                           |
| 24:50      | What would you do if you were at Apple to fix this issue?                                             |
| 24:54      | So for listeners who aren't familiar, sometimes you'll run a shortcut, you'll make it on your         |
| 24:58      | iPhone and it just won't run on the Mac because of the differences.                                   |
| 25:03      | I guess you'd look for a way to make every action work on every platform.                             |
| 25:08      | Well, I guess the problem, you can look at it as a technical problem like, oh, the action             |
| 25:16      | is broken on this platform, so maybe the one solution could be, well, what if actions,                |
| 25:23      | they don't give you an error message, instead they adapt to the other device, so they change          |
| 25:30      | depending on the device.                                                                              |
| 25:32      | So that could be one approach, but maybe you got to fix the underlying problem, which is              |
| 25:37      | why are some actions not supported on iPad?                                                           |
| 25:42      | So there's an argument there, I guess, where finder actions, they should become compatible            |
| 25:49      | with files or find windows, why is it not supported on iPad?                                          |
| 25:55      | So I guess the problem, if I were at Apple, I would say, how can we make sure that all                |
| 26:00      | these actions, with some exceptions, because I mean, AppleScript, does Apple really want             |
| 26:06      | to run AppleScript on iPad OS?                                                                       |
| 26:08      | Probably not.                                                                                         |
| 26:09      | So I would try as much as possible to trim the list of these exceptions and make all actions          |
| 26:18      | compatible cross-platform.                                                                            |
| 26:20      | And some of them, I mean, we're talking about some things that would seem like a distinction          |
| 26:24      | between a laptop and an iPhone, but some of them don't make sense at all, like the timer              |
| 26:31      | is a great one, like you can set a timer with an action on your iPhone, but the Mac doesn't           |
| 26:36      | support it.                                                                                           |
| 26:37      | Except the Mac does support it, if you do it via Siri, it can set a timer and countdown               |
| 26:43      | it.                                                                                                   |
| 26:44      | The shortcuts action gives you an error message, and it's like, it doesn't seem like it would         |
| 26:48      | be that hard to fix something like that, you know?                                                    |
| 26:50      | Right.                                                                                                |
| 26:51      | And there are issues with things like [[Safari]].                                                         |
| 26:53      | I mean, [[Safari]] Reader, which is the functionality that allows you to easily grab different components |
| 26:58      | of a web page, just doesn't exist on the Mac.                                                         |
| 27:01      | And to me, that's more of an issue for the [[Safari]] team to fix.                                        |
| 27:06      | There's greater compatibility between the two platforms.                                              |
| 27:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 27:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 27:13      | For me, I'd love to see things like the vibrate action, which only works on iPhone and Apple          |
| 27:17      | Watch.                                                                                                |
| 27:18      | Like, it should just be ignored on the other platforms, like maybe it should pop up like              |
| 27:22      | a thing that said, hey, I couldn't vibrate because I'm not a machine that has a vibrate               |
| 27:27      | feature in, but it shouldn't crash, like just stop your shortcut at the point where it would          |
| 27:33      | vibrate.                                                                                              |
| 27:34      | Or a logical thing would be to say, why don't you just flash the screen in inverse colours             |
| 27:38      | for a second, and that's a vibration on the Mac, you know, the screen flashes.                        |
| 27:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 27:45      | I don't know.                                                                                         |
| 27:46      | What I've done is I've just kind of learned that there are some that I run on Mac and                 |
| 27:50      | some that I run on the iPhone, and I, you know, it just, that's just the way it has to                |
| 27:54      | be.                                                                                                   |
| 27:55      | John was referencing [[Safari]] Actions earlier, that's to me one of the biggest offenders                |
| 27:59      | at this point.                                                                                        |
| 28:00      | I mean, people want to do stuff with the browser.                                                     |
| 28:03      | I can make these things to work in [[Keyboard Maestro]], but I can't make them work on shortcuts          |
| 28:08      | because, you know, of, I guess, background issues.                                                    |
| 28:12      | Right.                                                                                                |
| 28:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 28:14      | It's gotten a little better.                                                                          |
| 28:15      | I think that they're working on it.                                                                   |
| 28:16      | Because, you know, there are some, there were some changes in 12.3 that made all that                 |
| 28:21      | a little bit better, but it's still not nearly as extensive as it is on iOS or iPadOS.                |
| 28:27      | And that the lack of a share sheet really is a problem in my mind.                                    |
| 28:32      | And I think it comes down to a matter of perspective because the thing about iOS when it got its      |
| 28:38      | start was we didn't have a file system back the day.                                                  |
| 28:41      | And sharing was a matter of sharing content, right?                                                   |
| 28:44      | You're sharing text.                                                                                  |
| 28:45      | You're sharing photos.                                                                                |
| 28:46      | You're sharing whatever it happens to be.                                                             |
| 28:48      | And so the share sheet was critical to that platform.                                                 |
| 28:53      | On the Mac, it's always been a file based system and you've always had access to the                  |
| 28:56      | file system.                                                                                          |
| 28:57      | And so the share sheet, while we've got one, we've got a share button.                                |
| 29:01      | It's not under the hood, the same thing as you have on iOS, and it's never been nearly                |
| 29:06      | as capable.                                                                                           |
| 29:08      | And so I think it just, it just kind of fell by the wayside.                                          |
| 29:12      | And despite the fact that there are so many good triggers to kick off a shortcut on the               |
| 29:16      | Mac, that one missing has really been painful for me because we just, as people who write             |
| 29:23      | about things on the web, we're in [[Safari]] all the time using that share button.                        |
| 29:27      | And it's really not, you can't do it right now.                                                       |
| 29:31      | You guys think that the lack of the share sheet on the Mac is intentional or just we                  |
| 29:36      | haven't got to it yet?                                                                                |
| 29:38      | I think it's a little of both.                                                                        |
| 29:40      | I mean, that's kind of what I was saying in the sense, I think it's intentional in the                |
| 29:43      | sense that the Mac has a different history and as a result, the focus on that kind of                 |
| 29:50      | sharing mechanism just isn't there and hasn't ever really been there.                                 |
| 29:54      | And so as a result, they haven't gotten to it because of that, you know what I mean?                  |
| 29:59      | I also wonder if maybe Apple is looking at this from a different perspective because                  |
| 30:05      | we're here asking for the same share sheet on the Mac and usually Apple likes to take                 |
| 30:13      | a look at what people are asking and saying, well, you're asking for this, but what you               |
| 30:18      | really want, it's something else.                                                                     |
| 30:21      | It makes like, I look at stuff like what they added in iOS 15, right?                                 |
| 30:26      | With the receive what's on screen as a sign of how Apple may be looking at this.                      |
| 30:34      | They added this whole system, which is an action, but also an input type, which is whatever           |
| 30:39      | is displayed on screen can become input for a shortcut.                                               |
| 30:44      | And it doesn't always work great, but at least they're trying.                                        |
| 30:48      | So whether you're looking at a [[Safari]] web page, the shortcut knows it's a link.                       |
| 30:52      | And if you're looking at an image, the shortcut knows you want to share an image.                     |
| 30:55      | That's the idea.                                                                                      |
| 30:56      | So maybe Apple is listening to this feedback, asking for the share sheet on the Mac, but              |
| 31:02      | maybe they will have a special twist on it, which is, well, it's not a share sheet, but               |
| 31:09      | now you can trigger all your shortcuts with input from [[Spotlight]] or something like that.              |
| 31:16      | So like the idea that it's a Mac and it's different and it's primarily keyboard based,                |
| 31:22      | the share sheet makes more sense for an iPhone, but on the Mac, I could see like [[Spotlight]]            |
| 31:27      | become this like smart shortcuts activator of sorts where depending on what you're doing,             |
| 31:34      | it lets you pass input to a shortcut in different ways.                                               |
| 31:39      | Yeah, that would be pretty cool.                                                                      |
| 31:40      | I also think it would be interesting to see automations for shortcuts come to the Mac                 |
| 31:44      | because we've got the Automations tab inside of the shortcuts app on iOS and iPad OS, but             |
| 31:51      | it's not there on the Mac.                                                                            |
| 31:52      | And I know that there are many ways that you can trigger shortcuts actions or shortcuts               |
| 31:57      | on the Mac from a number of different things, but I think for your less technical user,               |
| 32:03      | the idea of having to use something like [[Keyboard Maestro]] or an AppleScript or something to          |
| 32:07      | trigger a shortcut to run automatically is a step too far where they're just not even                 |
| 32:14      | going to try.                                                                                         |
| 32:15      | You try and tell somebody what a cron job is and they're just going to run away screaming             |
| 32:18      | from you.                                                                                             |
| 32:19      | And to be fair, I don't blame them, you know, setting up a cron job can be an exercise                |
| 32:22      | in frustration, and I do understand it's more difficult to do automation on the Mac because           |
| 32:27      | people get upset when their automations don't run when their Mac is asleep, but if their              |
| 32:34      | iPhone isn't running and can't unlock to run a shortcut, then they think it's okay.                   |
| 32:40      | But it would be nice to have some more options there for things like that too, which would            |
| 32:46      | increase probably user support and certainly increase my happiness level.                             |
| 32:50      | Federico, what are some of the things you're doing on your Mac with shortcuts, like just              |
| 32:55      | kind of get through the day automations, not necessarily the stuff you're sharing on the              |
| 33:01      | website, but just the stuff you're making to get your work done?                                      |
| 33:06      | Well, by far, I think the shortcut that I use the most on my Mac is something that I                  |
| 33:14      | built for my [[Obsidian]] setup. I like to use this single note in [[Obsidian]], it's called                  |
| 33:21      | my dashboard note, which is like a starting place for all the work that I do and all the              |
| 33:27      | things that are on my mind.                                                                           |
| 33:30      | This note is structured in a way that at the top I see the things that I'm working on,                |
| 33:35      | like articles for the site or stuff for the newsletter. And at the bottom, there's literally          |
| 33:40      | this section called On My Mind, where I drop all kinds of thoughts and ideas that are not             |
| 33:46      | really fully formed yet. Like for example, I have a note to try out two different apps,               |
| 33:52      | like those are not to-dos, those are not reminders, they're not articles yet, they're just random     |
| 33:58      | things on my mind. And I have the shortcut that I can trigger with a hotkey anywhere                  |
| 34:05      | on my Mac, super easy, that just brings up a text field, like an ask for input field                  |
| 34:11      | anywhere. And it lets me type text and when I press enter, it pre-pends that thought,                 |
| 34:20      | that idea that I just saved at the beginning of this section. So it uses the finder actions,          |
| 34:27      | which on iOS and app at OS would be the files actions, and it modifies the dashboard note,            |
| 34:33      | which is a markdown file, and that's super easy. I've also now, thanks to the bug fixes               |
| 34:39      | that Apple made, I have been playing around more with the multitasking actions. So for                |
| 34:46      | example, one shortcut that I built, and that I'm going to share soon, I think, is this                |
| 34:52      | shortcut to create my, this is something that I really would love to have on iPadOS 16                |
| 34:58      | as a system feature, but anyway, a shortcut that lets me create my favourite combinations              |
| 35:04      | of apps. I like to you, sometimes I like to split the MacBook's display in two to have                 |
| 35:12      | one app on the left and the other on the right, not in full screen, like I'm not talking about        |
| 35:17      | full screen mode where you can do proper split between full screen, I don't like full screen          |
| 35:22      | on macOS and how it takes me to a separate space. I'm just saying on the desktop, split               |
| 35:28      | the screen with one app filling the left half, and the other filling the right half of the            |
| 35:34      | screen. And with the shortcut that I've built, I have defined a list of my favourites. So              |
| 35:40      | there's a literally a list at the beginning of the shortcut that says [[Safari]] plus messages            |
| 35:45      | or [[Safari]] plus obsidian, or [[Obsidian]] plus discord, like all these different combos of                 |
| 35:51      | apps that I find myself using in this kind of setup on a regular basis. And when I run                |
| 35:56      | the shortcut, I can choose the pair of these two apps that I want to use. And I select                |
| 36:04      | it and I press return and the multitasking actions for macOS, they arrange my desktop                 |
| 36:10      | exactly like I want it. So for example, [[Safari]] and, you know, on the left and discord on              |
| 36:15      | the right. So this like this sort of like presets, I guess, for multitasking, this is                 |
| 36:21      | something that I that I've started doing more and more on the Mac. And another that                   |
| 36:26      | you know me up there. Yeah, because I think I've done the exact same things. Is it a choose           |
| 36:30      | from menu action and then just running the single or it's a good question. It's actually              |
| 36:36      | a list and it chooses from a list. Okay. And the way that it does it is the shortcut tries            |
| 36:42      | to find an active window. Assuming that the app that I chose is running. But as I was                 |
| 36:50      | designing the shortcut to realise, well, what happens if the app that I selected, I forgot            |
| 36:55      | to open it, and it's not running. In that case, the shortcut was returning and error                  |
| 37:00      | because it was saying you're trying to place a window for this application on the right               |
| 37:05      | side. But this application is not actually open. You have to find the app first. Yeah.                |
| 37:10      | Exactly. So for that potential problem, I added a shell script action that uses the                   |
| 37:20      | OSA script command. So it's like a basically AppleScript from the shell that activates               |
| 37:25      | the application. First, if it's not finding any window belonging to that application uses             |
| 37:32      | the shell to fall back and say, okay, this app is not running, activate the app, wait                 |
| 37:38      | two seconds, and then try again. So even though even if the app is not running, the shortcut          |
| 37:45      | takes care of opening the app for me, wait a couple of seconds and try again to create                |
| 37:50      | the [[Split View]]. And it works pretty nicely.                                                           |
| 37:53      | Is there a particular reason why you're using the shell to call AppleScript for that rather          |
| 37:57      | than just using an AppleScript command directly?                                                     |
| 38:01      | Because yeah, also a very good question because for whatever reason, in 12.3, I couldn't put          |
| 38:08      | variables in the AppleScript. I think it's because Apple wants to validate the code of               |
| 38:14      | the AppleScript before it runs. Like you have the little hammer icon that sort of checks             |
| 38:20      | your code. And I guess that code cannot be dynamic. It cannot have variables. I guess                 |
| 38:26      | they don't care with the shell because you can put variables in the shell. So the name                |
| 38:31      | of the app that I want to launch is a text variable. And that's why I'm using also script             |
| 38:36      | with the shell instead of proper AppleScript.                                                        |
| 38:39      | That makes perfect sense.                                                                             |
| 38:41      | Yeah. So this is nice. And lastly, another one that John knows about this one. I was                  |
| 38:49      | trying to use, so I don't know if you guys know, there's an incredible emulator for                   |
| 38:54      | old Nintendo consoles called Dolphin emulator. And it lets you play old GameCube and Nintendo         |
| 39:01      | Wii games. And Dolphin emulator was actually updated with Apple Silicon compatibility.                |
| 39:07      | And it's got this, it's got amazing performance. So you can take like 20 year old games from          |
| 39:12      | the GameCube and you can play them in app scaled mode at 4K. Like obviously the GameCube              |
| 39:19      | did not have a 20 console. It was a 480p console 20 years ago. But you can play things like           |
| 39:27      | Metroid or Super Mario Sunshine at 4K on a MacBook Pro, even a MacBook Air, I guess.                  |
| 39:34      | In any case, usually I play Dolphin on my gaming PC and I keep all of its configuration stuff         |
| 39:42      | in [[Dropbox]]. I also wanted to play Dolphin on my MacBook Pro, but I wanted to sync those               |
| 39:48      | configuration files, those preferences. And I realised, oh, I gotta use SimLinks. I gotta             |
| 39:55      | create a symbolic link from [[Dropbox]] to the application support folder that Dolphin uses               |
| 40:02      | on macOS. So I couldn't remember the proper commands to create SimLinks in the terminal.              |
| 40:09      | And I realised, you know what? I'm gonna make a shortcut that creates SimLinks for me so              |
| 40:15      | that I don't have to worry about remembering the syntax in the future. So I created this              |
| 40:20      | thing called SimLink Creator that it's actually, it's a nice combination of two worlds in that        |
| 40:28      | it combines the visual actions of shortcuts with the shell script action. First, it lets              |
| 40:33      | you pick the folders that you want to sim link with one another using the native folder               |
| 40:38      | action. And then it uses the run shell script action to get the path of those folders and             |
| 40:45      | create a SimLink for you. So that was a, it all started because I wanted to play Metroid              |
| 40:50      | and it ended up as a, as a, as a lesson in automation for macOS and the shell. So that                |
| 40:57      | was cool.                                                                                             |
| 40:58      | I'm still using the good old June cloud who are the makers behind deliveries. They've                 |
| 41:03      | got a toolbox that you can download from macOS, including several services, one of which              |
| 41:07      | is creating SimLinks, but I might look at creating my own version of that now as, as                  |
| 41:12      | you've inspired me to do. So why not? Why not? Why not? Why not improve my setup?                     |
| 41:17      | If you can do it with shortcuts, why not? Right. I mean, if you can, go for it.                       |
| 41:22      | Yeah. It's always a good exercise to make sure that you actually remember how to do                   |
| 41:25      | these things.                                                                                         |

| 42:33      | snippets and you'll be surprised to know that I trigger them pretty easily. With TextExpander,       |
| 42:38      | you just get them under your fingers and they show up. But if you have a lot of text expansion        |
| 42:42      | snippets, here's a power tip. You can have it search your snippets for you. I use control             |
| 42:47      | option command I, but you can set the shortcut key right in the application. So you can search        |
| 42:52      | for the snippet if you haven't used it for a long time. I love that it's across my Mac                |
| 42:57      | and my iPad and my iPhone. I love the way it does fill ins and all the other cool automation          |
| 43:02      | tricks you can do with it. But most of all, I love the way it saves me time. I even get               |
| 43:06      | a report from TextExpander every month telling me all the hours and days that I save using           |
| 43:11      | it and making the show. I really believe anyone can automate and TextExpander can be that            |
| 43:16      | very first step for a lot of people because it's the easiest way to automate text. And                |

| 43:37      | and all of relay FM. Now, Federico, we've been talking about shortcuts, but you're on the             |
| 43:43      | Mac and there's other automation platforms. And I know you're pretty familiar with Apple              |
| 43:48      | script and shell scripting. And I don't know, are you doing any stuff with keyboard measure?          |
| 43:52      | What are the non shortcuts automation platforms you're using at this point on your Mac?               |
| 44:00      | I think the sort of the auxiliary tools that I'm using, I'm mostly copying copying copying            |
| 44:07      | from John. So John has gone, I think has a few more examples to share here. But John                  |
| 44:12      | really introduced me to this sort of cult in a good way of [[BetterTouchTool]]. All the                 |
| 44:20      | things you can do with [[BetterTouchTool]], if you combine that with shortcuts. So that's               |
| 44:25      | also something that I've been doing. Especially in terms of sending keystrokes to apps from           |
| 44:35      | a shortcut via the [[BetterTouchTool]] action. And I'm actually surprised that Apple doesn't            |
| 44:41      | have a native version of this, that you have to use the [[BetterTouchTool]] action to simulate          |
| 44:46      | sending a keystroke to an app. But for example, I have a shortcut that in the music app for           |
| 44:52      | Mac, it lets me view the lyrics sidebar. When I'm listening to a song and I want to check             |
| 44:59      | out the lyrics, lyrics on the Mac are a sidebar on the right side of the screen. And I wanted         |
| 45:04      | to have this quick way to toggle the lyrics sidebar from the keyboard. So I built this                |
| 45:09      | shortcut that uses the [[BetterTouchTool]] sends a keystroke, I think it's called action to             |
| 45:17      | toggle back and forth between hiding the sidebar and showing the sidebar. But yeah,                   |
| 45:22      | essentially, because I'm new to all this and John has been using macOS for far longer than            |
| 45:27      | I have, whenever he comes up with something that involves either [[BetterTouchTool]] or                 |
| 45:31      | [[Raycast]], I steal everything that John shares. Yeah, all right. And then I want to talk to             |
| 45:38      | you about this, John, because to me, Better Touch is like the pot of gold in shortcuts,               |
| 45:43      | like you install [[BetterTouchTool]], which is a great app to do a bunch of stuff. But then             |
| 45:46      | you look at it shortcut sections, and it's like, all of the stuff that fell off the back              |
| 45:50      | of the truck at Apple got added to [[BetterTouchTool]]. I mean, not only can you trigger                |
| 45:54      | short keyboard, you can also trigger menu items. I mean, I, when we had the Apple guys                |
| 46:00      | on Mac Power users, I'd asked them, are you ever going to let us do that? And they, they              |
| 46:04      | were very nice, but they kind of said no, you know, and, and [[BetterTouchTool]] is like,               |
| 46:09      | oh, no problem, we'll let you trigger anything in your menu bar with the shortcut. So what            |
| 46:14      | do you do with [[BetterTouchTool]], John?                                                               |
| 46:17      | All sorts of things. I mean, it really is impressive because it came out of the gates                 |
| 46:22      | when Monterey was released with an extensive list of actions that you can trigger that                |
| 46:28      | I've just not seen any other developer really accomplish. First of all, at a minimum, the             |
| 46:34      | shortcuts, even if you have a lot of shortcuts in your library, they load very quickly, which         |
| 46:38      | I'm not, there's not, not the case in a lot of other utilities that I've tried on the                 |
| 46:42      | Mac that incorporate shortcuts. So that's really a breath of fresh air. But I'm doing                 |
| 46:48      | a lot of the things that as Federico said, I'm doing triggering keyboard shortcuts. That's            |
| 46:54      | something that you just don't have. And it's very explicitly not allowed because you can,             |
| 47:00      | if you try to do it with AppleScript, you'll get an error that says that you can't send              |
| 47:04      | keystrokes with AppleScript using shortcuts. So I always fall back with [[BetterTouchTool]]            |
| 47:11      | on that because even sometimes when I'm trying to trigger a shortcut, you can obviously create        |
| 47:18      | your own keyboard shortcuts in the shortcuts app itself. However, I found at least early,             |
| 47:26      | in the first releases of Monterey, the [[BetterTouchTool]] implementation of that actually              |
| 47:31      | running the shortcuts was more reliable. Now that's, that's a closer race now. I mean,                |
| 47:36      | I think that that shortcuts is caught up there. But that's why I started relying on it so             |
| 47:41      | heavily so quickly, because both it's both the reliability and the extensive list of                  |
| 47:48      | things that you can do, you know, you can even do things like have a menu pop up on                   |
| 47:53      | screen that'll show you shortcuts that you have in your library and pick from them using              |
| 47:57      | that. I mean, there's another thing I did at one point was [[BetterTouchTool]] will allow               |
| 48:02      | you to create a little HTML window. And so I used a bunch of shortcuts actions to create              |
| 48:10      | myself a little weather forecast that would pop up each morning. And when I arrived at                |
| 48:16      | my desk, I'd have this window that would bring in information from the weather actions, information   |
| 48:22      | from my Natatmo weather station that sits on the windowsill outside my house and a bunch              |
| 48:27      | of other things like that. And that was all run through [[BetterTouchTool]] because I could             |
| 48:32      | create this little quick HTML UI that would pop up. And then I ran it on a schedule because           |
| 48:38      | scheduling is another feature of [[BetterTouchTool]], which works really well too.                      |
| 48:44      | Yeah. Yeah, [[BetterTouchTool]] really is great because it goes both ways. As you said, you             |
| 48:49      | know, it does, it gives you the option to run shortcuts and it makes your shortcuts much              |
| 48:52      | more powerful. So it's, it's, it's a little secret hack for everybody who's going, why                |
| 48:58      | can't I do this in shortcuts?                                                                         |
| 49:00      | Yeah, I was gonna say, Federico, anytime that there's something that I feel like I can't              |
| 49:07      | do the first place I look is [[BetterTouchTool]] at this point. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Something             |
| 49:12      | that I mentioned, running shortcuts on the Mac with [[Raycast]] or [[LaunchBar]], that is actually            |
| 49:18      | one thing that I wish [[Raycast]] would copy from [[LaunchBar]]. And that is when you're selecting            |
| 49:26      | a shortcut in [[LaunchBar]], I believe you can press space or tab to enter some input for                 |
| 49:35      | the shortcut from [[LaunchBar]] itself, which is a super clever way to do this, which is                  |
| 49:44      | you stay in the launcher itself. So if you want to pass some text, for example, to the                |
| 49:51      | shortcut that I mentioned a few minutes ago to save ideas, [[LaunchBar]] is actually perfect              |
| 49:55      | for this because you can type a few letters to find the shortcut, then you press a key,               |
| 50:02      | you type the text you want to save, you enter, you know, you press return, the shortcut runs          |
| 50:08      | in the background, which is another benefit of Mac OS compared to iPadOS, and you're done.            |
| 50:14      | Instead with [[Raycast]], because it doesn't have that built in method of passing text to the             |
| 50:21      | shortcut, you need to do it yourself. So in my case, I'm using the ask for input action               |
| 50:26      | in the shortcut, but I very much prefer the [[LaunchBar]] approach here. That said, [[Raycast]]               |
| 50:33      | has another thing, two other things that I love for the shortcuts integration. One is                 |
| 50:40      | you can mark certain shortcuts as favourites, so that when you open [[Raycast]], and in my case,           |
| 50:45      | it's a full on spotlight replacement, so that when I press command space, I see the [[Raycast]]           |
| 50:50      | window. And in the [[Raycast]] window, you have a favourite section, so you can pin your most              |
| 50:56      | frequently used shortcuts at the top of that section, and you always see them. But it also            |
| 51:02      | makes it very easy. This is my second, the second thing that I like. It also makes it                 |
| 51:06      | very easy to give a to give a hotkey to any shortcut. And for whatever reason, these hotkeys          |
| 51:12      | that I set in [[Raycast]] are more reliable than the native hotkeys in shortcuts itself. So               |
| 51:21      | I never use the Apple provided option for system white hotkeys. I use [[Raycast]] because                 |
| 51:28      | they trigger all the time without error whatsoever. Yeah, I've talked to [[Raycast]] about that doing     |
| 51:35      | the input thing, Federico, and I have my fingers across that they're going to allow it because        |
| 51:42      | they have something similar, which is you can set up a website query where you type                   |
| 51:48      | in a keyboard, you know, a keyboard combination, and then you type in your search terms, hit          |
| 51:53      | return, and then it does the search on Mac stories or Google or wherever you happen to                |
| 51:58      | be. And I think they should be able to do something like that for shortcuts as a result.              |
| 52:03      | I was going to say [[Alfred]] does offer the ability to do things like that to pass specific text         |
| 52:08      | or files and so on straight to a shortcut. So that that would seem like something that                |
| 52:13      | [[Raycast]] would want to add if only from the competition perspective of, you know, one                  |
| 52:17      | of the alternatives to us does this. And of course, both of them have different features              |
| 52:21      | which makes them both great. Are we all agreed is everybody here triggering shortcuts with            |
| 52:26      | some form of launcher other than shortcuts? Because I think I think all four of us are                |
| 52:31      | doing that. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Stream deck two, but less so in the sense that          |
| 52:37      | I with at least with a launcher that's always available. And if I'm not at my desk, then              |
| 52:42      | I can do it that way with the with the launcher. Yeah, exactly. And I also agree with Federico.       |
| 52:48      | I think that the built in keyboard combination launching mechanism isn't entirely consistent,         |
| 52:54      | which is a point of frustration for me for the reasons I was saying earlier. I mean,                  |
| 52:58      | we're trying to convince people to do this stuff and use the system. And sometimes the                |
| 53:03      | system doesn't work. And that's what I really think they need to be focused on now.                   |
| 53:08      | Sometimes when you're building a shortcut, the keyboard combination you've assigned just              |
| 53:12      | disappears. I've noticed you have to type it back in that happens to me once in a while.              |
| 53:17      | Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And that happens to me a lot on iOS. I'll select a variable and                 |
| 53:22      | I'll put it into like one of the placeholders, and then I'll select a property of it. And             |
| 53:28      | then I'll tap the return or whatever it is to close the keyboard. And then the variable               |
| 53:32      | just vanishes. What just happened here? Well, I mean, just, you know, the whole the decision          |
| 53:40      | to use [[SwiftUI]] to make this very complex system. In some respects, I admire it in other              |
| 53:47      | respects, I begrudge it because I feel like that's the reason I feel like that has some               |
| 53:53      | impact on why it's been a difficult year for shortcuts on the Mac.                                    |
| 53:56      | Almost certainly. I've heard from many developers that they've they've struggled with [[SwiftUI]]       |
| 54:01      | in various places. And for a lot of applications, it works incredibly well. But I think especially |
| 54:07      | on Mac OS, it is a struggle to implement things with [[SwiftUI]]. And I know I've seen some exciting     |
| 54:15      | undocumented features, let's call them in various applications on iOS, as developers                  |
| 54:20      | have been doing things. Dancing boxes was one of my favourites. You would swipe up and                 |
| 54:25      | down a list. And the boxes would just rearrange themselves. And the developers weren't doing          |
| 54:30      | that. No, that was just [[SwiftUI]], adding a little Easter egg.                                         |
| 54:35      | We talked earlier about a shortcut's wish list, you know, as [[WWDC]] approaches. You guys                |
| 54:43      | were focused largely on the Mac. What about on the iOS side? Is there stuff you'd like                |
| 54:48      | to see other than what we've already talked about?                                                    |
| 54:52      | I have this this very specific thing about allow people to design more types of UI in                 |
| 55:04      | shortcuts on iOS and iOS, meaning go beyond the basic choose from list and choose from                |
| 55:12      | menu and ask for input. Those are really the main three interaction methods that you have.            |
| 55:19      | For one, let me create better lists. I want to be I want to be able to create lists that              |
| 55:25      | have thumbnails or subtitles or checkboxes, you know, I want to be able to control the                |
| 55:34      | UI design aspect of shortcuts more. Apps like Pythonista and editorial did this right years           |
| 55:43      | ago. There was a whole UI building block in Pythonista and editorial in 2013, well before             |
| 55:50      | the days of workflow even. And I would love to see Apple do more along these lines. So                |
| 55:57      | more UI building features for power users for people who want to have like this sort                  |
| 56:05      | of mini apps in shortcuts, if you will. I also want to have more flexibility in the                   |
| 56:11      | widgets. I still believe that the shortcuts widget could use a lot more density in the                |
| 56:20      | space where, you know, in the medium widget in the rectangular widget where you can place             |
| 56:26      | four shortcuts, I would be comfortable with eight shortcuts, like I would double the number           |
| 56:32      | of shortcuts that you can see in the widgets. And I would also add an Excel size widget               |
| 56:38      | on iPad, which is for whatever reason absent. I mentioned third party app triggers, I would           |
| 56:45      | love to get those and system wide hotkeys on iPad. But in terms of the power user stuff,              |
| 56:52      | you never have enough debugging actions, right? You never have enough controls for designing          |
| 56:59      | shortcuts. So things like let me pause a shortcut at a specific action and debug what's going         |
| 57:07      | on in the editor. Again, editorial had this 10 years ago. Let me colour code some of my                |
| 57:14      | actions. Let me copy and paste entire blocks of actions. Right now, if you copy a conditional         |
| 57:23      | block or a repeat block, it just copies the main action.                                              |
| 57:28      | So annoying. Every single time I'm so optimistic, it's going to work and then I've tap paste          |
| 57:34      | and I'm disappointed. Exactly. So all those kind of things. And I would also add what                 |
| 57:40      | we mentioned toward the beginning of this episode to have more feature parity, especially             |
| 57:46      | between the iPad and the Mac, right? So the multitasking stuff should work on iPad. I                 |
| 57:52      | should be able to find windows. I should be able to, I don't want to say resize, right?               |
| 57:58      | Because we don't really have window resizing on iPad. Although there's an argument to be              |
| 58:02      | made as to whether we should. But anyway, at the very least, let me find Windows by                   |
| 58:06      | name, add support for multi-window. Right now in shortcuts, all you can do on iPad is                 |
| 58:13      | split screen between two apps. But if one of those two apps has multiple windows open,                |
| 58:18      | shortcuts doesn't care. It just picks up the most recently used one. It doesn't let you               |
| 58:22      | pick a specific window. So more parity there would be would be excellent.                             |
| 58:28      | I'd never thought about the user interface stuff. But man, you are so right. It wouldn't              |
| 58:33      | people love shortcuts more if they could make their own UI. What about you, John?                     |
| 58:38      | Yeah, I've got a couple. I guess, you know, I would, building on what, what Federico said,            |
| 58:43      | I would actually like to see more cross-platform integration that actually lets you coordinate        |
| 58:49      | shortcuts across multiple devices, both on the iPad and the Mac, for instance, so that                |
| 58:54      | I could start a shortcut that does something on my iPad, but calls out to my Mac, runs                |
| 58:59      | something there and gets an, gets an output back, and then I can continue to use it on                |
| 59:04      | my iPad. That would be, that would be really fantastic. And of course, the debugging tools            |
| 59:10      | are a big part of this too. I mean, I think we've seen with the popularity of, for instance,          |
| 59:14      | [[Alex Hay\|Alex Hay's]] app [[Logger]], that there is definitely a need for a logging tool as well as some             |
| 59:21      | of the other things that, that Federico mentioned as well. But the thing I would like in terms        |
| 59:27      | of actually editing shortcuts is in the editor on iOS and the Mac, I'd like to be able to             |
| 59:35      | copy and drag around blocks of actions, whether they're related to each other or not as a             |
| 59:41      | result of a conditional or a, or a repeat block or something. I just like to select                   |
| 59:45      | multiple actions and duplicate them over to another shortcut. If I've got them open in                |
| 59:51      | [[Split View]] on the iPad. And, and as part of that, it would be really nice to be able to               |
| 59:58      | create reusable snippets, reusable blocks of actions that you could store somewhere in                |
| 01:00:03   | shortcuts and then drop them in as units into your, into your shortcuts, because there's              |
| 01:00:09   | a lot of reusable code that we do all the time. And you can set up in [[Split View]] to                   |
| 01:00:15   | shortcuts and kind of move things across and do it that way. But having an actual library             |
| 01:00:20   | of snippets, which is something that very much exists for people who are doing programming            |
| 01:00:25   | and X code and that sort of thing would be fantastic and make the process for power users             |
| 01:00:30   | a lot easier.                                                                                         |
| 01:00:31   | Yeah, I mean, using [[Keyboard Maestro]], you can do a lot of that stuff. And it really feels             |
| 01:00:37   | crippling when you get over to shortcuts for Mac and you can't. But I want to talk about              |
| 01:00:42   | the, the debugging stuff, because I feel like that is a tough needle to thread for Apple              |
| 01:00:47   | because I agree with everything you said. I think we need better debugging tools, especially          |
| 01:00:51   | for advanced users. But I also think we need better debugging for simple users or for people          |
| 01:00:58   | who are getting started, because when you run a shortcut and just nothing happens that                |
| 01:01:02   | that does that's a problem. You're not giving feedback to people who are trying to learn              |
| 01:01:06   | how to use your automation platform. And I it's like, you got to come up with a debugging             |
| 01:01:11   | system. And honestly, anything is better than what they have now, which is kind of nothing.           |
| 01:01:16   | But I feel like it's got to be able to address people making two step shortcuts as well as            |
| 01:01:22   | 200 step shortcuts. And, you know, maybe it's kind of like, you know, the mouse support               |
| 01:01:27   | on the iPad, how they had to rethink it for that. I think you have to do the same thing               |
| 01:01:31   | for shortcuts, but I hope that is high on their list.                                                 |
| 01:01:34   | Yeah, it would be really nice. I mean, things like breakpoints and, you know, but the ability         |
| 01:01:38   | to pause in the middle of a shortcut running and see what the state of everything is at               |
| 01:01:43   | a particular point of time, those are, you know, those are just table stakes for you,                 |
| 01:01:49   | you know, IDEs, but we've got none of that on shortcuts, which just means you're left                 |
| 01:01:53   | with throwing up alerts or doing show results or, you know, maybe printing out some text              |
| 01:01:58   | or something. There aren't a whole lot of ways to do it at the moment.                                |
| 01:02:02   | No, there aren't. The other thing that I feel is kind of missing is a way to find all of              |
| 01:02:07   | your shortcuts that are using actions from a specific application. Something that people              |
| 01:02:12   | always ask me is like, so how many of your shortcuts are using Toolbox Pro? And that's              |
| 01:02:16   | not something I can answer using shortcuts. I mean, not directly, you can break it down               |
| 01:02:21   | and try and parse through things and do P lists and stuff, but it's suddenly incredibly               |
| 01:02:26   | complicated to do that. And, you know, fortunately, Apple have finally given us the ability or        |
| 01:02:32   | given developers the ability to share shortcuts actions across application versions, because          |
| 01:02:38   | that was a thing where, you know, you would have, for example, different shortcuts actions            |
| 01:02:43   | for things on iPadOS versus iPhone. So you had to do, if it's the iPhone, do this, and                |
| 01:02:48   | if it's the iPhone iPad, do that, or just install the iPhone version on the iPad, which was pretty    |
| 01:02:53   | terrible for those people who had to do that. But, you know, it would be really nice to               |
| 01:02:59   | figure out which ones this is. And I feel this ties back into my previous request of,                 |
| 01:03:02   | please don't give me unknown action. I don't know what this action is or anything about               |
| 01:03:07   | it. Thank you very much. Have a nice day anymore, because that is just so frustrating, like           |
| 01:03:11   | I opened a shortcut just now. And it's one I created on my Mac. It's a Mac OS only shortcut           |
| 01:03:16   | application. It can't work on iPadOS or iPhone OS, and it just said unknown action. So, oh,           |
| 01:03:24   | cool. I actually know exactly what this action is, but you're giving me no help whatsoever            |
| 01:03:28   | here.                                                                                                 |
| 01:03:29   | This episode of Automators is brought to you by Hunter Douglas. We all want to live well              |
| 01:03:34   | at ease in comfort and style. Hunter Douglas can help you do just that with their innovative          |
| 01:03:39   | window shade designs, gorgeous fabrics, and control systems so advanced they can be scheduled         |
| 01:03:44   | to automatically adjust to their optimal position throughout the day. Hunter Douglas's shades         |
| 01:03:49   | diffuse harsh sunlight, instead casting a beautiful glow across the room. With their                  |
| 01:03:54   | adaptability, you can enjoy the view outside a window without needing to give up your privacy,        |
| 01:03:58   | and you can bring this all together with Hunter Douglas's power view technology. This ensures         |
| 01:04:03   | all your shades will automatically reposition for the perfect balance of light, privacy,              |
| 01:04:08   | and insulation morning, noon, and night. I have to say, I love window shades that just                |
| 01:04:13   | open and close. There's no more thinking about, wait a second, did I open the shades                  |
| 01:04:18   | in the office today? Are the plants on the windowsill getting enough light there? It                  |
| 01:04:21   | just happens. And quite frankly, that's something that all of us would quite like. And there's        |
| 01:04:26   | nothing that makes a home that's temporarily unoccupied, look less lived in than the curtains         |
| 01:04:31   | staying open or closed all the time, and especially those blinds. I think that's why you might        |
| 01:04:36   | like Hunter Douglas. Hunter Douglas shades are compatible with all your favourite home                |
| 01:04:40   | automation systems. Amazon Alexa, Apple [[HomeKit]], Google Assistant, if there's something that          |
| 01:04:45   | and more. I know listeners of this show would really love to be able to automate this stuff           |
| 01:04:50   | themselves too, helping them integrate their shades with the products in their home that              |
| 01:04:54   | they already have that they can automate. And you can get that control with Hunter Douglas.           |
| 01:04:58   | So you can live beautifully with Hunter Douglas. Enjoying greater convenience, enhanced style,        |
| 01:05:04   | and increased comfort in your home throughout the day. Visit hunterdouglas.com/Automators       |

| 01:06:22   | Thank you so much for watching this video. I'll see you in the next video.                            |
| 01:06:52   | Thank you so much for watching this video. I'll see you in the next video.                            |
| 01:07:22   | Thank you so much for watching this video. I'll see you in the next video.                            |
| 01:07:52   | Thank you for watching this video. I'll see you in the next video.                                    |
| 01:08:22   | Thank you for watching this video. I'll see you in the next video.                                    |
| 01:08:52   | The idea was we're going to give you something for shortcuts and we're going to give you              |
| 01:08:55   | something to relax and enjoy your winning, you know, the contest.                                     |
| 01:09:00   | I guess we should mention too, of course, we have a wonderful panel of judges. We've                  |
| 01:09:05   | got the three of us at [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/), Federico, me and Alex Guillaume. But we also have David           |
| 01:09:11   | and Rose as well as [[Alex Cox]], [[Matthew Cassinelli]], [[Chris Lawley\|Christopher Lawley]], [[Jason Snell]], and [[Simon Støvring]]  |
| 01:09:19   | , the maker of [[Data Jar]]. So we've got a team of 10 people who are going to be                 |
| 01:09:25   | looking at all these shortcuts very shortly. Yeah, and there's multiple categories as well,           |
| 01:09:30   | isn't there? So it's not just, you know, that there's one category for all the shortcuts              |
| 01:09:35   | and shortcuts lying together. That's right. Yeah, we've got [[HomeKit]] and                               |
| 01:09:39   | productivity, media, and Mac-specific shortcut. So best in all those categories as well as            |
| 01:09:46   | for a total of five. Getting back to the idea that anybody can automate, Federico, you are            |
| 01:09:52   | now legendary for your prowess with shortcuts, but you had to start somewhere. Where was              |
| 01:09:57   | the first thing you ever automated on one of your computers or devices?                               |
| 01:10:02   | Man, probably Launch Center Pro, I think, back in the days of [[URL Schemes]], it was probably            |
| 01:10:12   | like, well, no, no, it was AppleScript. Before I was a primarily iPhone and iPad user, I              |
| 01:10:23   | realised, I don't know, I've always been into like, customising things and modifying things           |
| 01:10:28   | to make them more personalised and better for me. I've always been a tinkerer with computers.         |
| 01:10:36   | And I don't know how exactly, but it must have been one of [[Brett Terpstra\|Brett Terpstra's]] old Apple                 |
| 01:10:43   | Scripts or like Markdown things or something from Doug's iTunes [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]] back in the             |
| 01:10:52   | day. And I think I started tinkering there on my Mac. So we're talking 2008, 2009. And                |
| 01:11:02   | later, my interest in automation really picked up though with Launch Center Pro [[Drafts]] and            |
| 01:11:08   | really with Pythonista and Editorial. So that would be 2012 and 2013 when Editorial came              |
| 01:11:16   | out. And I really never stopped. So starting with Pythonista in 2012, Editorial in 2013,              |
| 01:11:24   | and then Workflow in 2014. That's when it really started for me, this kind of modern                  |
| 01:11:31   | automation. And then with Workflow and later shortcuts. And here we are today.                        |
| 01:11:36   | How about you, John? Where did you get started with automation?                                       |
| 01:11:40   | It really kicked in for me around 2013 when I got into iOS development. And I did a little            |
| 01:11:47   | bit of development myself that was centred around things like [[URL Schemes]] and affiliate              |
| 01:11:53   | linking and that sort of thing. And I had an app for a while that did that. And it got                |
| 01:11:58   | me... It's interesting because I think one of the harder things to do is to get into                  |
| 01:12:03   | shortcuts from a start of doing development work because it's just such a different mindset           |
| 01:12:10   | in shortcuts. Whereas when you're doing development work, you have this sense everything has to       |
| 01:12:16   | be precisely defined. Whereas shortcuts does so much for you that if you have a background            |
| 01:12:21   | in development, it's very hard to get started. And so that was actually a bit of a speed              |
| 01:12:26   | bump for me getting into shortcuts initially. But so I cut my teeth, I guess, in X code.              |
| 01:12:32   | And then once I started working at [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/) in 2015, and of course, it's very hard to be           |
| 01:12:39   | in the same room as Federico and not pick up a few tips on Workflow and shortcuts along               |
| 01:12:44   | the way. So I've had a good teacher and I've just been kind of going from there ever since            |
| 01:12:49   | I joined [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/).                                                                                 |
| 01:12:50   | All right. So automation April, you guys are now a few days into it by the time this show             |
| 01:12:56   | publishes, you'll be almost a week into it. How's it going? You making it? You're okay?               |
| 01:13:03   | Yeah, we're doing all right. It's been fantastic. We've been really happy about the response.         |
| 01:13:08   | It's nice to see everybody getting involved and helping each other online. We've seen                 |
| 01:13:12   | a lot of that in our [[Discord]] community. And it's a lot of work, but it's also very satisfying         |
| 01:13:17   | work. So we'll probably be pretty spent and tired by the end of April, but it's been well             |
| 01:13:22   | worth it so far.                                                                                      |
| 01:13:23   | At least you've got May to recover before [[WWDC]].                                                       |
| 01:13:26   | Yes, true, true. But it's really incredible to see one of the features that we have, thanks           |
| 01:13:33   | to our developer Alex, whenever someone submits a shortcut for the contest, and if they also          |
| 01:13:40   | happen to be members of the [[Discord]], we have the [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/) [[Discord]] bot that automatically           |
| 01:13:48   | gives them a special role in [[Discord]]. And this special role is shown as a little indicator            |
| 01:13:54   | next to your profile picture with the logo of Automation April. And it's been really                  |
| 01:13:59   | fun to see over the past few days, those special badges pop up in more places on [[Discord]], which       |
| 01:14:06   | means that people are progressively submitting the shortcuts. And as they do that, that's             |
| 01:14:12   | one of the things that I really love about the shortcuts community in general. It's                   |
| 01:14:16   | a competition short, but it's a healthy competition. And there's always that aspect of folks helping  |
| 01:14:22   | each other. And we see these people who are technically competing for the same price in               |
| 01:14:29   | the same contest, but at the same time, they're also exchanging tips with one another and             |
| 01:14:34   | helping each other with, like, hey, maybe you can do this better in this shortcut, or maybe           |
| 01:14:38   | you can use this variable in this different way. And that's so, you know, there are many              |
| 01:14:46   | terrible things in the world. But in this very small and very specific niche of the                   |
| 01:14:50   | internet, it's nice to see people who don't know each other in real life, you know, they're           |
| 01:14:55   | totally complete random strangers come together for one very specific goal. And it's just             |
| 01:15:02   | cool to see, honestly.                                                                                |
| 01:15:04   | It really is.                                                                                         |
| 01:15:05   | I mean, we've got, we're just so lucky with our community that the people that are interested         |
| 01:15:11   | in this stuff just in general are really great people, you know, and yeah, they really are.           |
| 01:15:17   | And I, for one, can't wait to see what the community generates with this stuff. I am                  |
| 01:15:24   | my hats off to you for for putting all this together. Can we just go ahead and book you               |
| 01:15:28   | next year? Are we going to have you back for automation April next year? Is it too early              |
| 01:15:32   | for me to say that?                                                                                   |
| 01:15:33   | No, that's fine.                                                                                      |
| 01:15:34   | I think it's totally fine. I mean, I mean, we want to do it annually. So we do. Yeah,                 |
| 01:15:40   | absolutely.                                                                                           |
| 01:15:41   | Good.                                                                                                 |
| 01:15:42   | Perfect. Yeah.                                                                                        |
| 01:15:43   | The more people out there that figure out this stuff, the better we all are. And honestly,            |
| 01:15:48   | you know, we talked a lot today about things we'd like to see Apple change, but you know              |
| 01:15:51   | what? We'll get Apple to put more bodies on this problem. It's more people creating shortcuts         |
| 01:15:57   | and more people talking about it and sharing it. And, you know, it's the reason Automator             |
| 01:16:02   | died on the vine. I mean, there was a lot of reasons, I'm sure, but one of them was                   |
| 01:16:06   | it's never got the traction it needed. And so anything we can all do to help everybody                |
| 01:16:11   | start using shortcuts means, you know, the better shortcuts gets for all of us. And                   |
| 01:16:16   | the more people who want to automate things, the more automation possibilities there will             |
| 01:16:19   | be for everybody as well.                                                                             |
| 01:16:21   | Yep.                                                                                                  |
| 01:16:22   | And the more people automate, the more people are going to listen to automators. So that's            |
| 01:16:26   | a good thing.                                                                                         |
| 01:16:27   | Also, more people listen to app stories as well, I'm sure.                                            |
| 01:16:30   | But that's the goal. Like, you know, more people discovering this stuff means we have                 |
| 01:16:35   | a bigger audience, which means we get more ideas, which means we make more shortcuts.                 |
| 01:16:40   | And it's this virtual cycle of people automating and sharing ideas and us making more shortcuts       |
| 01:16:47   | and talking about it. We're lucky. Honestly, we're all lucky that we can do this for a                |
| 01:16:52   | living.                                                                                               |
| 01:16:53   | Oh, yeah.                                                                                             |
| 01:16:54   | Yay, automation. Yes.                                                                                 |
| 01:16:55   | All right. Final question before we let you two go because I know you've both got a deadline.         |
| 01:16:59   | How many shortcuts are in your shortcuts library?                                                     |
| 01:17:02   | Let's see.                                                                                            |
| 01:17:03   | This is a good question because I just trimmed them recently.                                         |
| 01:17:05   | All right. It's not too bad. It's not too bad. It's not too bad. 218.                                 |
| 01:17:10   | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 01:17:11   | Wow.                                                                                                  |
| 01:17:12   | Federico, I got you.                                                                                  |
| 01:17:13   | I am surprised. That is a much lower number. You are very good at clearing out your shortcuts,        |
| 01:17:17   | Federico.                                                                                             |
| 01:17:18   | Well, to be fair, I also delete the ones that I put on the [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/) shortcuts archive.                |
| 01:17:23   | Right.                                                                                                |
| 01:17:24   | So in theory, there's like 260 something other shortcuts to consider. But yeah, I try to              |
| 01:17:30   | keep a clean library.                                                                                 |
| 01:17:31   | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 01:17:32   | I have 379 right now, but I'm also notorious for having too many apps on my phone too,                |
| 01:17:42   | which Federico likes to tease me about. So I guess it's not surprising.                               |
| 01:17:46   | You're a digital hoarder. So it makes perfect sense.                                                  |
| 01:17:49   | All right. I'm just going to hide my 1,152 shortcuts under our grub chains.                           |
| 01:17:54   | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 01:17:55   | Wow.                                                                                                  |
| 01:17:56   | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 01:17:57   | Wow.                                                                                                  |
| 01:17:58   | I don't delete shortcuts really. I mean, I do. I'll delete the ones that are called like              |
| 01:18:01   | shortcut one or untitled shortcut or whatever they are. But like other than that, I tend              |
| 01:18:06   | to just keep it around and you know, it might get used again. It might not. It doesn't take           |
| 01:18:10   | up any space.                                                                                         |
| 01:18:11   | Yeah. It is rough. I'm at 16, but a lot of mine are for field guides where there are                  |
| 01:18:16   | ones that like I've got the shortcuts from Act Field Guides 144, which are not ones I                 |
| 01:18:20   | actually use. They're ones I made to demonstrate functions. But the, you know, we all have            |
| 01:18:26   | too many and I guess I think we're all kind of like in the fringe area.                               |
| 01:18:31   | I would guess that most people have like five or 10, you know, so but yeah, although I would          |
| 01:18:37   | bet some people in your contest are up there with us with a lot of shortcuts.                         |
| 01:18:41   | Oh yeah.                                                                                              |
| 01:18:42   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:18:43   | I'm sure.                                                                                             |
| 01:18:44   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:18:45   | Either way, I am so happy you guys are doing this and I hope everybody checks it out. I               |
| 01:18:48   | didn't mention earlier, but app stories is the podcast made by John and Federico together.            |
| 01:18:54   | And I feel like the Venn diagram of people who would like the automators and app stories,             |
| 01:18:58   | it looks like a circle drills in this show. You should go check out app stories. I think              |
| 01:19:02   | you would probably dig it. I will note that at the 33 minute mark, Federico used the word             |
| 01:19:09   | [[Obsidian]] and I did not take the bait, but that doesn't mean I'm saving it for the after               |
| 01:19:15   | show, David.                                                                                          |
| 01:19:16   | We're good.                                                                                           |
| 01:19:17   | I noticed that.                                                                                       |
| 01:19:18   | I am so ready to talk to you about obsidian, but I think I need like four hours because               |
| 01:19:22   | I have a lot of thoughts, but either way. Thanks so much for coming on guys and thanks                |
| 01:19:29   | for doing this. Rose and I have a little bit more after this ad break, but we're going                |
| 01:19:33   | to let John and Federico go and get all that content out for Automation April. Everybody              |
| 01:19:38   | go check it out and check out app stories too.                                                        |

| 01:21:24   | So David, you mentioned before we let John and Federico run away that you heard the magic             |
| 01:21:30   | word obsidian, you didn't dive in, but I'm not going to let you off that easily because               |
| 01:21:33   | I know that your [[Obsidian]] setup is being tweaked and played with, you know, well, it's always         |
| 01:21:39   | being evolved because that's what our systems are. But what have you been automating there            |
| 01:21:43   | recently?                                                                                             |
| 01:21:44   | I'm actually looking right now because I built all of my [[Obsidian]] automations and keyboard            |
| 01:21:50   | maestro initially. And I find it really easy because I use, you know, I, you know, the                |
| 01:21:57   | contextual computing thing that I like to do where if I hit option control command M,                 |
| 01:22:03   | it opens up a quick conflict palette and [[Keyboard Maestro]] that has like everything in my life         |
| 01:22:09   | related to MacSparky, you know, M. And if I type L for, for labs, then there's a bunch               |
| 01:22:16   | of [[Keyboard Maestro]] actions or scripts. What do they call it in [[Keyboard Maestro]]? I guess             |
| 01:22:23   | are they scripts or are they automations?                                                             |
| 01:22:25   | Macros.                                                                                               |
| 01:22:26   | Macros. Okay.                                                                                         |
| 01:22:27   | It's a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro.                                                                        |
| 01:22:28   | Keyboard maestro macros. I always forget that. But anyway, so I've got them like if                   |
| 01:22:30   | I want to create a new early access, you know, content for the early access subscribers,              |
| 01:22:37   | I can hit the magic M, then L, then E, and then it just opens up a field where I can                  |
| 01:22:44   | fill things in and I have checkboxes and all kinds of cool things going on. And then it               |
| 01:22:48   | creates a note for me in [[Obsidian]]. So I've been doing that historically, but, you know,               |
| 01:22:55   | because now we can save to anywhere on the directory with shortcuts, I've been toying                 |
| 01:23:01   | with the idea of moving that stuff into shortcuts. I do have some inconsistencies though. And         |
| 01:23:07   | in accessing the local area of the drive when I run that shortcut, like on an iPhone versus           |
| 01:23:12   | a Mac.                                                                                                |
| 01:23:13   | Yeah. Yeah. That is difficult. One of the things that I have tried to do there, I've                  |
| 01:23:19   | tried a couple of different things. Obviously on the Mac, it's easier because you can use             |
| 01:23:22   | the tilde, that's the horizontal squiggly line to access folders in your users folder.                |
| 01:23:30   | So even if you end up with, you know, different, different usernames, for example. So technically     |
| 01:23:39   | the entire folder path would be different. Then you can, you can just still access it.                |
| 01:23:45   | But what I've ended up doing on iOS is I've got an if action, or I've got a series of                 |
| 01:23:51   | if actions, it's not fun. And it says, Hey, if this device is iPad mini, then do this.                |
| 01:23:58   | If it's iPad Pro, do that. If it's my iPhone, do the other thing. And it gives me the different       |
| 01:24:02   | folders, which is not fun. I don't love it, but it also works. So I'm okay with it. But               |
| 01:24:11   | it's, it's tricky.                                                                                    |
| 01:24:12   | Yeah, that's the way I've solved it is I'm just generally running, still running them                 |
| 01:24:17   | from keyboard master on my Mac. And then when I'm on, I generally run them with shortcuts             |
| 01:24:22   | on my iPhone and that they all work there. And yeah, it just takes a minute. Another                  |
| 01:24:27   | thing I'm doing in [[Obsidian]] is data view filters, you know, you can filter on different               |
| 01:24:33   | methods. And like, one of the things I keep, Federico had talked about how he has like                |
| 01:24:38   | a single page where he kind of does everything, I've consolidated that on to my Sparky OS             |
| 01:24:43   | page. And I've got a group of data view filters, which are related to active MacSparky projects.     |
| 01:24:52   | And historically, I was running a data view filter that would look for something that                 |
| 01:24:56   | had the tag, you know, MacSparky, you know, webinar and active. And then I've got a heading          |
| 01:25:03   | there that says active webinars, and it'll look for those three tags and give me any                  |
| 01:25:07   | note that has that in it. And then when I finish it, I could just change the tag to                   |
| 01:25:12   | shipped and then it would disappear from the list. I did an experiment over the weekend               |
| 01:25:16   | where I moved a couple of those into a folder based system. And that's particularly useful            |
| 01:25:21   | for blog posts, because I've got at any one time, you know, five to 10 blog posts, I'm                |
| 01:25:27   | actively writing in five to 10 that I'm kind of cooking on. And I'm always moving them.               |
| 01:25:33   | And, and I find it kind of useful to put them in folders called active and cooking. And               |
| 01:25:39   | so rather than use a tag based system where I've got to go in and manually change the                 |
| 01:25:43   | tags, I just have a folder. Yeah. And then with data view, you can have it                            |
| 01:25:49   | say, show all items in this specific folder and then organise them by the last time you               |
| 01:25:56   | worked on them. And, and I, you can put in a list or you can put a table, I'm putting                 |
| 01:26:00   | that one in a table. And so then it just discloses what's in my active folder, what's in my cooking   |
| 01:26:07   | folder, and it puts on that right on the Sparky OS page. And then I can just click into any           |
| 01:26:11   | one that I want to see. And that experiment has been working pretty well. I think I may               |
| 01:26:16   | expand the folder based kind of system over the tag based system and some of the other                |
| 01:26:20   | kind of project areas of my life.                                                                     |
| 01:26:22   | Yeah, yeah, no, I've primarily ended up sticking to folders for things like that as well. For         |
| 01:26:27   | example, my blog posts are in a folder. And yes, there are lots of ideas, which very slowly           |
| 01:26:32   | drop out onto my blog. But it, it, it works very well for me tags. I, I tend-to-end up                |
| 01:26:39   | wanting. So for me, a tag ends up being static, whereas a folder can be dynamic. And it sounds        |
| 01:26:45   | a bit weird, but it means it's easy to move things between different folders. And I don't             |
| 01:26:50   | have to try and change the tags on different things, which I know there are some [[Obsidian]]             |
| 01:26:55   | plugins, which can make this easier. There's one meta view, I think it's called for updating          |
| 01:27:03   | your metadata meta table, meta edit, sorry, that's the one meta edit is the one I'm thinking          |
| 01:27:09   | of where you can change properties of things directly from like, say a [[Kanban]] view. But               |
| 01:27:16   | I find it's a bit difficult because I still want the list to be dynamically created of                |
| 01:27:21   | just things in the folder. I don't want to add something to the folder. And then it not               |
| 01:27:26   | to appear in a list somewhere. So I've stuck with a lot of those as well. One thing I'm               |
| 01:27:32   | curious to do, have you played with the calendar option in [[Dataview]] at all? Is that something         |
| 01:27:36   | you've worked with? Slightly, I want to hear what you're doing with it. But before we                 |
| 01:27:41   | move on, I just wanted to add another piece of this puzzle for me is I have attached the              |
| 01:27:47   | keyboard shortcut control F or command F, I'm sorry, no control F, you know, it's under               |
| 01:27:53   | your fingers, but you have to like to put your hand on the keyboard to do it. And so                  |
| 01:27:57   | I can move a note to a different folder very quickly. And the reason why the folder thing             |
| 01:28:03   | works is because I can be in a note and say, okay, this is done. And I can just type blog             |
| 01:28:09   | a and it goes to the blog archive folder or blog C and it goes to the blog cooking folder.            |
| 01:28:14   | So I just found it was faster to move them with a keyboard shortcut than to go in and                 |
| 01:28:18   | try and reset attack. But yeah. All right, so tell me about calendars and [[Dataview]].                   |
| 01:28:23   | Well, it's one of those things where I love the idea of the calendar query. So, you know,             |
| 01:28:28   | for people who are thinking, wait, [[Dataview]] does calendars. So it does lists, tables, it              |
| 01:28:34   | can do like a list, it can do tasks. But it also has the option to do a calendar, where               |
| 01:28:40   | you can do a calendar and you can do it by, for example, the modified time file. And then             |
| 01:28:46   | from the from part of the query is the same as you would do anywhere else where you can               |
| 01:28:49   | say from folder or from anything with this tag and so on. But I it's one of those things,             |
| 01:28:55   | I love the idea. But what I struggle with at the moment, and I was actually kind of hoping            |
| 01:29:00   | you might have a solution for this, David, is the time or the date is not necessarily                 |
| 01:29:06   | actually from when I created the file or when I modified the file. Instead, it might actually         |
| 01:29:11   | be a date in the metadata in the file, like in the AML header, which I use. And I've not              |
| 01:29:17   | yet found a way to do that. And I was hoping that you might have found a way because, you             |
| 01:29:21   | know, you've often found sneaky little ways to solve problems like that.                              |
| 01:29:24   | Yeah, I haven't needed that. So I have never played with it. What's the context that you're           |
| 01:29:29   | using it in?                                                                                          |
| 01:29:30   | Well, for me, I was actually trying to use it to plan out some stuff at work where I'd                |
| 01:29:35   | written down, you know, a bunch of the the upcoming deadlines for various different things.           |
| 01:29:40   | And there were there were notes for each thing that had a deadline or for each deadline. And          |
| 01:29:45   | I just wanted to pull all of those in. So what I've ended up doing is I'm not now remembering         |
| 01:29:52   | how I did this correctly. And of course, this is on my my work machine, so I can't pull               |
| 01:29:56   | up the files here to check. But I put the the deadline date into the file name, which                 |
| 01:30:00   | I was then able to parse out, because you can get the date from the file name, but I                  |
| 01:30:05   | wasn't able to get it out to the metadata. Maybe one of our listeners has a solution                  |
| 01:30:08   | to this problem for me. If you do, please feel free to post in the thread for this episode            |
| 01:30:13   | or or email me. But yeah, I quite like it. I was also looking at doing a sort of content              |
| 01:30:20   | calendar with it for a few different things that I've got coming up where it's like I                 |
| 01:30:25   | just want nice big overviews of things. But each each event is basically something where              |
| 01:30:30   | I need a note. And I thought that it might be something that you were doing with your                 |
| 01:30:34   | MacSparky Labs, because I know that there's a lot of planning and everything involved                |
| 01:30:37   | in that too.                                                                                          |
| 01:30:38   | Yeah, so what I do my content calendar is in my calendar. And I'm going to cover this                 |
| 01:30:44   | in that webinar. But the I have made planning calendars for every like major area of MacSparky,              |
| 01:30:51   | like there's a planning calendar for podcasts, there's a plan order for labs and              |
| 01:30:56   | for the field guides. And so I make day long events for plan days on particular items of              |
| 01:31:04   | publication or content. And then using Fantastical, they have this amazing new quarter view,        |
| 01:31:11   | I can just set up a view that just shows me the the the planning calendars in the quarter             |
| 01:31:18   | view. And since there's no hourly events in it, it all just shows up as day long events.              |
| 01:31:23   | And then there are links in there to in the event there's a link to OmniFocus if applicable,          |
| 01:31:30   | there's always a link to an [[Obsidian]] project page. And so everything ties together that               |
| 01:31:34   | way. So I've just put it into my calendar is how I yeah, I mean, that that's how I've                 |
| 01:31:38   | been doing a lot of things. It's just when I realised that you could also create a calendar           |
| 01:31:42   | with data viewers, like, Oh, Oh, is this solving the problem that I have? And it's almost there,      |
| 01:31:48   | it's so close to almost there. And so I think I just need to maybe do a little bit of searching       |
| 01:31:52   | on the [[Obsidian]] forums of I've yet to spend real time doing that. I've just tried a few               |
| 01:31:57   | of what seemed to me like the obvious things. Of course, I'm looking at this from the perspective     |
| 01:32:02   | as a developer who writes PHP and JavaScript every single day. So it may not be actually              |
| 01:32:07   | what the logical thing is for an [[Obsidian]] user. But I yeah, I'm I'm very much enjoying                |
| 01:32:13   | how extensible the data view plugin is. And also just the template or plugin as well, because         |
| 01:32:20   | I know you use a lot of templates, but I realised the template or plugin and there's also another     |
| 01:32:25   | plugin called custom JS will let you just run JavaScript on things, which means that                  |
| 01:32:30   | I can take something out of a file and use that to rename the file if I wanted to, which              |
| 01:32:36   | has been very helpful for renaming certain files like for example, my blog post for me                |
| 01:32:43   | because I create my blog post from a template. But it just gives it like a placeholder name.          |
| 01:32:49   | But then once I've added the title and everything into the into the metadata, then I can run          |
| 01:32:54   | my it's it's custom JavaScript, but I could do the same thing with template to to rename              |
| 01:32:59   | that file to the correct name, which has everything in it as it as it needs to for Jekyll, which      |
| 01:33:04   | is really nice. And I really like that. Yeah, I mean, my work is kind of wrapping up on               |
| 01:33:09   | the shortcuts or Mac field guide now, there's still post production happening, but I'm not            |
| 01:33:13   | doing as much of that. And I'm starting this, the [[Obsidian]] field guide, I can't wait this             |
| 01:33:19   | this app is so fun. Have you gone down the rabbit hole of task management and [[Obsidian]]                |
| 01:33:24   | much? So I have and I haven't so I have certain projects which repeat on a regular basis.             |
| 01:33:30   | So for example, releasing automators. And so I've put some of those lists into [[Obsidian]]               |
| 01:33:38   | for various things, but I found that it doesn't necessarily work very well for me in the in           |
| 01:33:44   | the sense that unless there is other data that I need to collect and write as part of                 |
| 01:33:52   | my my plan for whatever it is that I'm doing, it doesn't make sense for me to have my tasks           |
| 01:33:59   | in there. The exception to this is my projects where I have like, I've got a note for most            |
| 01:34:06   | projects. And that that is in there and that may contain ideas for tasks. But once I've               |
| 01:34:12   | decided I'm actually going to go actively do with the thing, I it doesn't live in [[Obsidian]]            |
| 01:34:17   | anymore. I put it in OmniFocus just because that means that I've only got one place to                |
| 01:34:21   | check and for me, the automation and indeed life fails when not everything is in one place.           |
| 01:34:27   | It gets too complicated to keep track of where everything is, which is just frustrating.              |
| 01:34:32   | I agree totally. I have the same thing. I've been playing with the idea like with podcasts.           |
| 01:34:37   | I have a checklist for every podcast that goes out. And I built that now into the [[Obsidian]]            |
| 01:34:42   | template. So it just gets added to each show. And honestly, this is stuff almost kind of              |
| 01:34:49   | it's just not almost not worthy of OmniFocus. That makes sense to you. Yeah. And I'm in the           |
| 01:34:55   | note for the show as we record it and I'm record the ads and do all that. So I'm I put that all       |
| 01:35:01   | there. But and I did some experimentation. I'm in the midst of I'm going to be doing some stuff       |
| 01:35:06   | in the max parking labs further with it. But there is a really great like tasks plugin for [[Obsidian]].  |
| 01:35:13   | And I think a lot of people can make it work. But I still kind of believe that there's nothing        |
| 01:35:19   | wrong with having like a best in class app for the stuff you do. Like, yeah, like [[Fantastical]].          |
| 01:35:24   | Because I feel like it's the best calendar app. And I like OmniFocus. I think it's the best task      |
| 01:35:29   | app. And, you know, just because you can do everything in a tool like [[Obsidian]], Roam, Craft,          |
| 01:35:35   | whatever, you know, doesn't necessarily mean you need to turn it into everything.                     |
| 01:35:40   | Yeah, I think the other element of this and this is a mental things as opposed to, you know, a        |
| 01:35:47   | productivity specifically or automation thing is having everything in one app, it kind of             |
| 01:35:52   | ends up making you go, I don't want to open that app, because everything is in there. Like,           |
| 01:35:58   | your entire calendar is in there, all of your tasks are in there. And all you wanted to do            |
| 01:36:02   | was jot down a quick note. And I find that, you know, if I will end up avoiding apps, if it feels     |
| 01:36:08   | like they've got like trolls in the shadows waiting to grab me. And so I like by splitting            |
| 01:36:15   | things up a bit, then I can see OmniFocus, you know, there's 10 things there. But honestly,           |
| 01:36:19   | those are things that I actually did before the show today, before recording that I just              |
| 01:36:23   | didn't mark off because I was in a rush making sure I was actually ready for the show, rather         |
| 01:36:27   | than checking off the items. And, you know, I've since marked those off, you'll be pleased to hear.   |
| 01:36:34   | Which is good. The one exception is I should say is I don't have tasks for my bulk posts.             |
| 01:36:40   | I don't do that. I just have a view in [[Obsidian]] where or a file in [[Obsidian]] which lists all           |
| 01:36:51   | of my draft blog posts so I can kind of see them as a list of things to do. And when I'm done,        |
| 01:36:59   | then it's finished. And that's it. So that's what I do there instead. And I don't know,               |
| 01:37:06   | is that something you also do? Because then it is kind of task management, but it's also              |
| 01:37:11   | I don't feel a particular pressure to go and write a blog post at this precise moment in time.        |
| 01:37:17   | Yeah, you and I are kind of on the same page with that. Although I am really trying to                |
| 01:37:22   | delegate some more of the back end stuff. Like, you know, I've been on a roller coaster between       |
| 01:37:29   | shutting down the law practice and getting the labs up and the stuff I'm doing, but I'm starting to   |
| 01:37:34   | kind of get things referring to smooth out a bit. And I just haven't had time up until now to figure  |
| 01:37:39   | out what I can delegate. But if I end up delegating some of that stuff, then it will turn into tasks. |
| 01:37:46   | But for now, like getting a blog post up for me, I don't need a checklist for that. That's just a     |
| 01:37:50   | waste of time. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And like for me, just having the blog post there, like any        |
| 01:37:57   | notes of anything in particular that I want to write, I just put it in the actual post file.          |
| 01:38:03   | I'm really trying to simplify things like that. If it's just an idea for a blog post,                 |
| 01:38:07   | it gets a file. It doesn't matter, you know, whether or not there's loads of detail in there,         |
| 01:38:13   | or if it's just three words, it's totally okay. And I'm trying to, you know, not make myself          |
| 01:38:20   | overthink these things, because it doesn't have to be a task if it doesn't need to be,                |
| 01:38:25   | which is quite useful. And I think that's one of the things where I've been, I've done very well      |
| 01:38:30   | with [[Obsidian]], you know, my entire home network, the setup of it, the structure, all of the MAC       |
| 01:38:36   | addresses, fixed IP addresses and stuff, all of that pretty much right now is documented. There's     |
| 01:38:40   | a few things missing in a couple of places. And that's it. And I've been able to do that just         |
| 01:38:45   | because I added like the first file. And then I progressed from there and added more and more         |
| 01:38:52   | things. And I'm really pleased that I was able to accomplish that because I just                      |
| 01:38:57   | just added a note. And then I added a little bit to the note and things just kind of snowballed       |
| 01:39:01   | until I realised, hey, my entire home network pretty much is documented, which clearly means          |
| 01:39:05   | it's time for it to redesign my home network and adjust how everything is laid out. But yeah,         |
| 01:39:12   | it is surprisingly easy once you've got a good application for things like that to just               |
| 01:39:17   | keep it all rolling. Well, I mean, they're called personal knowledge management for a reason, right?  |
| 01:39:20   | And exactly, you know, the, and I get like, I do have notes in here on stoicism and meditation        |
| 01:39:28   | and Buddhism. And I have, I have like kind of the intellectual wing of my [[Obsidian]] install,           |
| 01:39:33   | but I also have the note that shows when my dog needs her vaccines. So it is kind of,                 |
| 01:39:39   | you know, all encompassing in some respects, but I don't take it to the length of,                    |
| 01:39:44   | of managing tasks and calendars as well. Or the other one people always do with it is they put        |
| 01:39:49   | their journals in it. And, you know, if you've got the end date encryption, I think there's no        |
| 01:39:54   | reason why you shouldn't. But I like using [[Day One]], I've been using it for a long time.               |
| 01:40:01   | Like making an entry in [[Day One]] on my iPhone is way easier than it is in [[Obsidian]] on my iPhone.       |
| 01:40:07   | So, you know, I've chosen to, you know, leave other some areas out of it.                             |
| 01:40:13   | One thing I want to go back to real quick, you talked about like ideas or blog posts,                 |
| 01:40:18   | and I, that is something I've thought through a lot lately because I am suddenly,                     |
| 01:40:22   | I've got multiple channels. It's not just a blog, but I've got podcasts, blogs, labs, field guides,   |
| 01:40:28   | and I found myself getting hung up when I get a new idea, but like, well, where does it really        |
| 01:40:33   | fit? So now I just capture what I call content ideas. And it's just a content idea. And I,            |
| 01:40:39   | I've got a category there and I flag it at the time I capture it with active or future.               |
| 01:40:44   | And so I can look at ideas. And then when I have time to think about, say, oh,                        |
| 01:40:48   | this would be a great blog post, or this should be something I should run for the                     |
| 01:40:51   | MacSparky Labs, or this should be an episode with me and Rose. And, and, and actually taking         |
| 01:40:57   | out the decision of what I do with it at the moment of capture has really helped me.                  |
| 01:41:01   | Yeah, honestly, that's why the reason is why I end up using draft so much because I just              |
| 01:41:05   | write something that's like, okay, right, this is a note that I'm going to want to like,              |
| 01:41:08   | flesh out and do stuff with, I'll just chuck it into [[Obsidian]]. Or, hey, this is probably              |
| 01:41:13   | a blog post idea. And so it also throws it in obsidian, but it throws it in a specific [[Obsidian]]       |
| 01:41:19   | folder for me, which is, which is nice. And, you know, just trying to remove some of that,            |
| 01:41:24   | that friction, which means that you can actually do all the things that we need to do instead of,     |
| 01:41:29   | you know, spending all of our time tweaking gears and stuff so that we can crank the widgets          |
| 01:41:34   | in exactly the right way that is needed, which is not so much fun.                                    |
| 01:41:38   | All right. Well, so we did get to talk to about [[Obsidian]] after all today, Rose.                       |
| 01:41:43   | Yeah, not, not the four hours you wanted with Federico, but I'm sure we can get him back in           |
| 01:41:47   | the future. I just won't tell him it'll be a four hour show in advance.                               |
| 01:41:50   | Actually, if we tell him it's about obsidian, I think he'd probably be down with it.                  |
| 01:41:53   | You know, I mean, probably, probably, we'll have to ask him and see.                                  |
| 01:41:57   | Okay, so that'll do it for today. We're the Automators podcast. You can find us at                    |
| 01:42:00   | relay.fm/automators. This is episode 99, Rose. What are we going to do for episode 100?         |
| 01:42:06   | I was thinking a big party like party like it's 1999, except it's currently episode 99,               |
| 01:42:12   | so we've still got a few weeks. And of course, if anybody's got anything in particular,               |
| 01:42:16   | they want to share with us four episode 100, they should send that in. You can tweet at us            |
| 01:42:21   | automators FM on Twitter. You can email us the links on the relay FM website, relay FM slash          |
| 01:42:28   | automators. And of course, you can post it in the forums to share things. You know, maybe             |
| 01:42:33   | the favourite automation thing you've learned from automators or the favourite non-automation           |
| 01:42:38   | thing you've learned, that's okay too. But yeah, share your favourite stuff with us,                   |
| 01:42:43   | and we've got some fun things planned for next episode too.                                           |
| 01:42:45   | Yeah, we should probably have said that at the beginning of the show, but you know,                   |
| 01:42:47   | there you go. We're excited. We talked about automation. Thank you to our sponsors,                   |
| 01:42:53   | Electric Smile, Hunter Douglas, and Doppler. We'll see you next time.                                 |
| 01:42:56   | Goodbye, everyone.                                                                                    |
