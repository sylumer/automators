| 00:00      | Hello, this is David Sparks.                                                                         |
| 00:03      | I am joined by my fellow co-host, Rosemary Orchard, and this is The Automators, where                |
| 00:08      | we talk about how to automate your technology to do your bidding for you.                            |
| 00:12      | Hello, Rosemary.                                                                                     |
| 00:13      | Hey, David.                                                                                          |
| 00:14      | How are you?                                                                                         |
| 00:15      | Excellent.                                                                                           |
| 00:16      | I am in the festive mood, and I thought it'd be fun to do a show talking about automation.           |
| 00:22      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 00:23      | I almost wanted to do an app bank calendar, you know, 24 automations, but I mean, we're              |
| 00:28      | probably going to cover at least 24, but there's just so much, so much involved.                     |
| 00:32      | There's just something about the holidays that make automation stand out.                            |
| 00:37      | I feel like it's the one time in the year where you can impress your loved ones with                 |
| 00:42      | your automation prowess.                                                                             |
| 00:44      | I think a lot of people are interested in automation around holiday decorations, and                 |
| 00:51      | there's just a lot of things going on this time of year that involve electricity, and                |
| 00:55      | where there's electricity, there's the possibility to automate.                                      |
| 00:58      | So we've got a lot to cover today.                                                                   |
| 01:01      | We did one of these shows a year or two ago, but we started looking at our list.                     |
| 01:05      | We got a whole bunch of new stuff, so we thought, let's just do one more, because I think the        |
| 01:10      | technology is evolving, and there's a lot more you can do now, and we've got a full                  |
| 01:15      | outline for today.                                                                                   |
| 01:16      | Yes, and as well as a technology evolving, I think it's easier than ever to dip your                 |
| 01:22      | toe in if you weren't interested before, and let's face it, people have been doing automation        |
| 01:29      | when it comes to Christmas and the holidays for years.                                               |
| 01:32      | If you watch Home Alone, they know the exact time that all the different lights on each              |
| 01:37      | house turn on, because everybody's using a timer switch.                                             |
| 01:40      | Well nowadays, we don't have to program timer switches by going over to the wall and pressing        |
| 01:44      | little things in or something like that.                                                             |
| 01:46      | We can control them by setting them up from our phones, which is even more powerful.                 |
| 01:51      | What's his name, Kevin?                                                                              |
| 01:53      | Kevin.                                                                                               |
| 01:54      | Kevin.                                                                                               |
| 01:55      | This is the last thing I remember, but he was like-                                                  |
| 01:56      | McAllister.                                                                                          |
| 01:57      | Kevin McAllister.                                                                                    |
| 01:58      | Kevin McAllister.                                                                                    |
| 01:59      | One of the original automators.                                                                      |
| 02:01      | I mean, that thing where you use the record player to make the cardboard cutout dance,               |
| 02:05      | I mean, come on.                                                                                     |
| 02:06      | That is amazing, right?                                                                              |
| 02:08      | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| 02:09      | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| 02:10      | That's pretty awesome.                                                                               |
| 02:11      | I also love Mark Rober, the guy on YouTube with the glitter bomb.                                    |
| 02:16      | Those packages are addressed to Kevin McAllister.                                                    |
| 02:17      | Oh, are they?                                                                                        |
| 02:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 02:19      | Yeah, they are.                                                                                      |
| 02:20      | I love the fact that this pops up everywhere.                                                        |
| 02:23      | I mean, I think the thing is, is that automation belongs everywhere that you want to put it,         |
| 02:28      | and it's probably a lot of places that you haven't thought about as well.                            |
| 02:31      | A little bit of a side thing here, but the same guy that does the Glitter Balms, have                |
| 02:35      | ever seen his Squirrel obstacle course?                                                              |
| 02:37      | Oh my gosh.                                                                                          |
| 02:38      | Yes, the Squirrel obstacle course is hilarious, brilliant, and wonderful, and the follow-ups         |
| 02:44      | are really good as well.                                                                             |
| 02:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 02:46      | I just heard there's a follow-up.                                                                    |
| 02:47      | I haven't watched that one yet.                                                                      |
| 02:48      | We'll put it in the show notes.                                                                      |
| 02:49      | Basically, he had a bunch of Squirrels in his backyard, and he decided that if they're               |
| 02:54      | going to eat, they need to work for it, and he built an obstacle course for Squirrels.               |
| 03:00      | It's pretty funny watching it, and honestly, it is kind of on brand for automators, right?           |
| 03:04      | I mean, that is-                                                                                     |
| 03:05      | It very definitely is.                                                                               |
| 03:07      | He is very much more on the engineering side of automation, but it's very cool watching              |
| 03:15      | a lot of his stuff.                                                                                  |
| 03:18      | One of the YouTube channels that I will always make time to watch when there's new stuff             |
| 03:22      | that comes out, just because things like the Glitter Balm and so on are really impressive.           |
| 03:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 03:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 03:28      | It's nuts, but there's definitely an overlap, I believe, between all of that and people who          |
| 03:33      | are interested in automation.                                                                        |
| 03:35      | So we'll put those links in the show notes, and you can enjoy that stuff.                            |
| 03:41      | So let's talk automation, though, in terms of the holidays, and I thought it'd be fun                |
| 03:46      | just going to start out with some of the stuff we're doing or thinking about doing as we             |
| 03:50      | record this.                                                                                         |
| 03:52      | One of the ones that you had written down, I don't think you've done it yet, though,                 |
| 03:56      | although I think is a great idea, is the advent calendar wallpaper automation.                       |
| 04:02      | Tell us about that.                                                                                  |
| 04:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 04:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 04:05      | So the idea that I've got that I'm still working on, but I'll get a link into the show notes         |
| 04:09      | for people who are interested, is essentially that every day throughout December, you end            |
| 04:15      | up with a different wallpaper based on the day of the month.                                         |
| 04:21      | And so you use shortcuts to do this, but you can also do this on the Mac using something             |
| 04:26      | like [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                               |
| 04:27      | And the idea is basically you point shortcuts or [[Keyboard Maestro]] at a folder, and it contains       |
| 04:34      | a very simple series of numbered files.                                                              |
| 04:37      | And so you have 31 of them, because of course there's 31 days in December.                           |
| 04:42      | And then every day in December, it will go in and it will get the one with that day's                |
| 04:46      | number.                                                                                              |
| 04:47      | And then you're done.                                                                                |
| 04:48      | And it says it's your wallpaper and you're done.                                                     |
| 04:50      | And especially on the iPhone, where you can just set the lock screen wallpaper or the                |
| 04:54      | background wallpaper behind your apps, and you don't have to set both, it's a really                 |
| 04:59      | nice way to both change things up a little bit and bring you a little extra joy every                |
| 05:04      | day without also having a significant impact on how things work.                                     |
| 05:08      | Because of course, everything still works with a different wallpaper, it's just a little             |
| 05:11      | prettier maybe.                                                                                      |
| 05:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 05:13      | And shortcuts now has the set wallpaper action.                                                      |
| 05:18      | That's something that was in beta last year and got pulled at the last minute.                       |
| 05:23      | I always wonder why that one never made the cut.                                                     |
| 05:26      | I think I remember reading that you were technically able to set any file as the background image    |
| 05:33      | and a file is not an image.                                                                          |
| 05:35      | And therefore I think it was pulled probably for security reasons.                                   |
| 05:39      | I don't know if they were being somewhat paranoid when it comes to the security reasons or if        |
| 05:43      | they were genuinely very concerned that something could go wrong there.                              |
| 05:48      | But it doesn't matter because they pulled it and they brought it back.                               |
| 05:51      | And I've just realised set wallpaper should work on macOS as well.                                   |
| 05:55      | So maybe I can set my shortcut to work cross-platform on all of the devices, which would be lovely.  |
| 06:01      | Though of course, it will have to point at different folders on different devices, David,            |
| 06:04      | because I don't want an iPhone wallpaper appearing on my iPad, but I've got a pretty                 |
| 06:08      | good idea of how to solve that using device details, get device details in shortcuts.                |
| 06:13      | And so you have a folder called hold the wallpaper inside, you know, wherever some shortcuts         |
| 06:18      | can access it.                                                                                       |
| 06:19      | And then inside of that, you would have one for iPhone, one for iPad and one for Mac.                |
| 06:23      | And then it can go into that folder within the whole day wallpaper folder to get it.                 |
| 06:28      | And you'd nest those in an if command.                                                               |
| 06:30      | So first you get the device details, what, you know, is it an iPhone?                                |
| 06:33      | I mean, actually, I just get the device details and then get the type of device and then take        |
| 06:38      | that type of device and put it in the folder so you don't even need to do any if branching,          |
| 06:42      | which should make it easier.                                                                         |
| 06:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 06:44      | And then you could, you could account for all three of them in one shortcut.                         |
| 06:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 06:48      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 06:49      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                       |
| 06:50      | That would work.                                                                                     |
| 06:51      | The other thing I think would be fun with that would be to do a random call, like pick               |
| 06:56      | a random number.                                                                                     |
| 06:58      | And that's easy enough with shortcuts or [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                           |
| 07:01      | And then you select a random file so you don't have the, well, the other thing that you              |
| 07:06      | can do instead of just doing the number to start with is you can actually filter files               |
| 07:12      | and this is an action in shortcuts.                                                                  |
| 07:14      | I think it might be called sort file note.                                                           |
| 07:16      | No, it's filter files.                                                                               |
| 07:17      | And then you can say sort by random and then limit it to say one file because then you'll            |
| 07:24      | just pick a random one every single day.                                                             |
| 07:26      | Now what I would go ahead and do after that, just because for me, random, I want not true            |
| 07:33      | random.                                                                                              |
| 07:34      | I don't want things to repeat themselves.                                                            |
| 07:36      | So what I would do after is I would then set the wallpaper so you get all the wallpapers             |
| 07:41      | for that device.                                                                                     |
| 07:43      | You filter it to get a random one.                                                                   |
| 07:46      | You set that to your background and right at the end, delete the file.                               |
| 07:49      | Because otherwise you'll have true render and you can get the same one multiple times.               |
| 07:54      | But by filtering it down, by deleting the file at the end.                                           |
| 07:58      | You're removing it from the pool.                                                                    |
| 07:59      | You're taking it out of the pool and that way you've not got true random, which is just              |
| 08:03      | like iTunes, now [[Apple Music|Apple Music's]] random is not true random.                                            |
| 08:07      | They try to make sure that you hear everything before it starts over.                                |
| 08:11      | This will work the same way.                                                                         |
| 08:12      | And what I would also do is before I would not make that folder, the only place I keep               |
| 08:19      | that date.                                                                                           |
| 08:20      | Like if you go to the trouble of getting 31 holiday themed wallpapers, just make a copy              |
| 08:24      | of it.                                                                                               |
| 08:25      | So you're deleting copies, not your original set next year.                                          |
| 08:29      | You can make another copy and run the same shortcut again.                                           |
| 08:32      | Exactly.                                                                                             |
| 08:33      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 08:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 08:35      | That is definitely what I would do there to make sure that happens.                                  |
| 08:39      | But it is something I've been playing with.                                                          |
| 08:40      | I had something similar last year and it was pretty great, but the way it worked was that            |
| 08:45      | I knew exactly what files I had and I had them assigned to a specific day of the month.              |
| 08:51      | I hadn't really thought about randomising it, but this way you don't even have to name               |
| 08:54      | the files in a specific way.                                                                         |
| 08:57      | You can just filter randomly and leave them with whatever default names they have or whatever        |
| 09:03      | pretty names you've given them.                                                                      |
| 09:04      | Yeah, that works.                                                                                    |
| 09:06      | And shortcuts for Mac, there's some updates on that.                                                 |
| 09:09      | I want to talk about that.                                                                           |
| 09:11      | We're going to cover that towards the end of the show today, but there's news on that                |
| 09:15      | front and Rose and I have some things we want to talk about with respect to where shortcuts          |
| 09:20      | for Mac is currently.                                                                                |
| 09:22      | But either way.                                                                                      |
| 09:23      | All right.                                                                                           |
| 09:24      | Well, that's a good one, Rose.                                                                       |
| 09:25      | I mean...                                                                                            |
| 09:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 09:27      | I mean, I think we've just fleshed it out a lot more right now because I've been talking             |
| 09:32      | to you and that's one of the great things about automation, especially when it comes                 |
| 09:35      | to the holidays.                                                                                     |
| 09:36      | People are much more open to talking about these things and being excited by possibilities           |
| 09:41      | and going from there to actually creating things for others can also be great fun.                   |
| 09:47      | After that one, I have a very simple one, but this is one that I absolutely rely on.                 |
| 09:53      | I got on Amazon for, I think, all of about $15 or $20 a few years ago, a [[HomeKit]] enabled             |
| 10:00      | plug.                                                                                                |
| 10:02      | And so they've got a little QR code on it.                                                           |
| 10:05      | You hold it up to your phone and it pairs with [[HomeKit]] nicely.                                       |
| 10:08      | You don't have to go to any third-party apps.                                                        |
| 10:11      | And I have it in the garage connected to the string that goes outside that puts the outdoor          |
| 10:17      | lights on it.                                                                                        |
| 10:18      | And I know there's a lot of ways to do this.                                                         |
| 10:21      | So this is controlling my outdoor lights and it's a very simple [[HomeKit]] formula.                     |
| 10:26      | It just says when it's dark, turn them on and then turn them off at 10 p.m.                          |
| 10:31      | And now I know people listening, I'm like, well, there's a lot of other ways.                        |
| 10:36      | We could do the home alone way where you just put it on a timer and they make those where            |
| 10:43      | you can just plug it in the wall and it turns on at a specific time.                                 |
| 10:45      | But I don't really like that because when it gets dark, changes during the course of                 |
| 10:50      | the holidays, another way to do it is they make outdoor sensors where it senses when                 |
| 10:56      | it's dark and then turns the lights on.                                                              |
| 11:00      | The problem with that is sometimes I want to turn them off early or late.                            |
| 11:06      | And I love having the ability to just open my phone and push a button and turn them off              |
| 11:10      | or on.                                                                                               |
| 11:11      | And like I said, it's very inexpensive to buy one of those plugs.                                    |
| 11:15      | The other problem with the light sensor one is I used to keep it in my yard.                         |
| 11:20      | I had one of those for a few years.                                                                  |
| 11:22      | And every time I'd pull in the driveway, the headlights would hit the sensor.                        |
| 11:26      | Sensor would think it's daylight.                                                                    |
| 11:27      | The lights would turn off every time I pulled in the driveway.                                       |
| 11:30      | And then when I turned my car off, then the sensor would say, oh, it's dark again.                   |
| 11:34      | Let's run them for another six hours.                                                                |
| 11:37      | So the [[HomeKit]] automation is just such a superior technology for outdoor lighting.                   |
| 11:45      | Yes, yeah, it definitely is.                                                                         |
| 11:48      | And honestly, even if you're thinking, oh, I don't know about [[HomeKit]], you can just                  |
| 11:52      | get a smart plug where you can control it.                                                           |
| 11:55      | Now, one of the things I'll say if you've not already tried home automation stuff out                |
| 12:01      | with this is you'll probably end up with a Wi-Fi plug.                                               |
| 12:06      | And those are pretty good.                                                                           |
| 12:07      | I've got a Meross one, M-E-R-O-S-S, I got that for a couple of friends actually last year             |
| 12:13      | to automate their trees and so on with indoors.                                                      |
| 12:16      | But they also do outdoor ones, outdoor rated plugs, which is pretty good.                            |
| 12:20      | So you can look at that.                                                                             |
| 12:22      | But if you're just thinking, oh, I'll just get one to try it out, or maybe I can get                 |
| 12:26      | one for my parents, it is absolutely something you can do.                                           |
| 12:29      | Because if you get one of these that's a decent one, it'll have a power button on the side.          |
| 12:36      | And that means that you can then, you know, you can just walk over it to it and press                |
| 12:39      | the button to turn it on and turn it off, which means that even for those people who                 |
| 12:43      | aren't necessarily super into automation, it's going to be very easily accessible to                 |
| 12:48      | them because they'll look at it and they press the button that's got a power symbol on and           |
| 12:53      | it turns the tree on.                                                                                |
| 12:54      | Woo!                                                                                                 |
| 12:55      | And then they press the button and it turns the tree off.                                            |
| 12:56      | And then you can put schedules and so on in the app, or you can add it to [[HomeKit]] for                |
| 13:02      | that sort of thing, which is quite nice.                                                             |
| 13:04      | Yeah, I mean, it's nuts that this stuff is as simple as plug and play at this point.                 |
| 13:11      | And the way I handle the outdoor versus the indoor plug, they do make outdoor plugs.                 |
| 13:16      | I've had less luck with those in the past.                                                           |
| 13:19      | I feel like there's a combination of problems that's hardened for rain and whatnot.                  |
| 13:25      | And I think that makes it harder for radio signals to get through to it.                             |
| 13:29      | And it's also just farther away from my router.                                                      |
| 13:32      | And so...                                                                                            |
| 13:33      | I've had a harder time kind of keeping those consistently working, but they do work.                 |
| 13:40      | But in my case, what I did was I run the cord actually from the garage outdoors.                     |
| 13:46      | So I actually put the plug indoors before the cord goes outside and that way it's protected          |
| 13:52      | from the weather, it's closer to the router, and it just works 100% of the time.                     |
| 13:58      | And let's face it, if you need to troubleshoot it, like, you know, something's not working,          |
| 14:03      | it's much easier to go into a garage to troubleshoot than it is to go outside when it's wet and      |
| 14:08      | cold and all of those things.                                                                        |
| 14:09      | I was really hoping you'd say garage with your British accent, because that sounds so                |
| 14:14      | much cooler than the way I say it.                                                                   |
| 14:16      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                          |
| 14:17      | It is much easier to do that.                                                                        |
| 14:19      | Not that I've had to do any troubleshooting on these, but at least on the Merosss ones.                |
| 14:25      | But that is certainly something in their favor.                                                      |
| 14:27      | And of course, it's pretty easy to buy an outdoor rated extension cable or extension                 |
| 14:32      | lead, or what is it, gang switch, I've forgotten the American term for that.                         |
| 14:40      | And those are cheaper as well.                                                                       |
| 14:41      | So you know, solve a couple of problems there.                                                       |
| 14:44      | Speaking of these plugs, actually, David, this year, I've swapped, last year I was using             |
| 14:49      | a couple of individual smart plugs on my Christmas tree.                                             |
| 14:53      | And this is fine when you think, you know, you've just got one or two things.                        |
| 14:57      | But of course, I have more than one or two things.                                                   |
| 14:59      | And I had to plug an extension lead in and then plug the smart plugs into that.                      |
| 15:04      | And you know, there's pluses and minuses.                                                            |
| 15:06      | But the problem with an individual smart plug is it's quite bulky.                                   |
| 15:12      | So you've got, you know, for example, for me, I've got an extension lead.                            |
| 15:15      | So that's one thing that plugs into the wall with like three or four sockets.                        |
| 15:19      | And then I had the smart plug on one of those.                                                       |
| 15:22      | And then the thing that was plugging into it, which of course has got its own transformer            |
| 15:25      | on top, on top of that.                                                                              |
| 15:27      | So I'm there looking at something, you know, 15, 20 centimeters, six, eight inches high.             |
| 15:33      | That's pretty big and quite frustrating.                                                             |
| 15:36      | So this year I have swapped my parents are the happy recipients of two smart plugs, pre-labeled      |
| 15:43      | Christmas tree and Christmas lights and a remote control that pair with their IKEA hub               |
| 15:49      | that they already have.                                                                              |
| 15:51      | I've given them that and I bought a smart extension lead, which, you know, one thing                 |
| 15:54      | into the wall, four sockets, two USB ports, all individually controllable.                           |
| 15:59      | Well, individually controllable, the USBs get controlled as one.                                     |
| 16:03      | But I figured this is going to be a better Christmas solution for me because then I just             |
| 16:07      | plug one thing in and all of it's controllable.                                                      |
| 16:10      | And that's what I'm doing this year, which is, I think, easy enough to grok.                         |
| 16:16      | The only thing I have to watch is I've got some smart lights, but the only place I have              |
| 16:20      | to plug them in is the smart extension lead.                                                         |
| 16:22      | So I'll just have to make sure I don't turn them off on the extension lead.                          |
| 16:25      | Now, did you get the Meross one?                                                                      |
| 16:27      | Which one did you get?                                                                               |
| 16:28      | I did get the Meross one, yes.                                                                        |
| 16:31      | It was on sale as these things frequently are at this time of year and it's [[HomeKit]] compatible.      |
| 16:39      | So I don't need to futz around with Homebridge or [[Home Assistant]] to try and get it into [[HomeKit]].     |
| 16:43      | So that said, holiday lights are pretty set to them forget it.                                       |
| 16:47      | So if I had ended up with something like one of the TP-Link ones, which isn't [[HomeKit]]                |
| 16:52      | compatible, then I could have just set up a schedule.                                                |
| 16:55      | And I'm sure in their app it would have been fine.                                                   |
| 16:57      | But I went for [[HomeKit]] just because I like having everything in one app to control that              |
| 17:03      | I want to control.                                                                                   |
| 17:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 17:05      | And this is new since the last time we covered this, these smart power strips, for lack of           |
| 17:12      | a better term.                                                                                       |
| 17:13      | And I'm just looking at Amazon now and there's a whole bunch of them.                                |
| 17:17      | I know you've been pretty happy with the Meross stuff.                                                |
| 17:20      | The little power plug I have for the outdoor light is one as well that I bought last year            |
| 17:24      | on your recommendation.                                                                              |
| 17:26      | And these Meross four outlet power strip is not on sale, but it's $41.                                |
| 17:33      | So it's about $10 per plug.                                                                          |
| 17:36      | And as I understand it, each one of these is individually addressable via [[HomeKit]].                   |
| 17:40      | Like if you had a Christmas tree and maybe a Christmas village and a few other decorations           |
| 17:46      | and you had them all in the same place, you could just run one of these and run everything.          |
| 17:50      | Man, this is tempting, Rose.                                                                         |
| 17:51      | I think I might have to order one of these.                                                          |
| 17:54      | They are really good.                                                                                |
| 17:56      | And I'm sure some people are there going, wait, why are you going to want to control                 |
| 17:58      | some of these things individually?                                                                   |
| 18:00      | Well, for me at the very least, my Christmas tree is next to my television.                          |
| 18:06      | And so that means if I want to sit and watch a film, I don't have to sit and watch in pitch          |
| 18:09      | darkness, absolutely not.                                                                            |
| 18:11      | But certainly I have lights that go around the unit that my TV sits on and so on.                    |
| 18:17      | And so what I like to do is I like to dim the room, and that means turning some of these             |
| 18:21      | lights off, but not all of them.                                                                     |
| 18:24      | Because otherwise, of course, I could just buy one single smart plug, put it in the wall,            |
| 18:29      | and then plug a regular power strip, as you call it, extension leaders, what we say over             |
| 18:32      | here, into that.                                                                                     |
| 18:34      | The only thing, the only other thing I'll say about that is you need to watch the rating             |
| 18:39      | of the smart plug.                                                                                   |
| 18:40      | If you're planning on plugging a power strip or an extension lead into a smart plug, check           |
| 18:44      | to make sure that it can handle the amperage and voltage of what you're putting through              |
| 18:48      | it.                                                                                                  |
| 18:49      | Because some of these can be quite low rated.                                                        |
| 18:53      | Most of them nowadays, I think the Merrill's individual ones are 13 amps.                            |
| 18:57      | But you need to basically just have a look and do a bit of maths to do a sanity check                |
| 19:03      | on that to see whether or not it'll be OK.                                                           |
| 19:05      | And that's one of the reasons why I ended up going for the smart extension lead or the               |
| 19:09      | smart power strip, just because this way, I don't even need to think about this.                     |
| 19:12      | It's definitely rated for everything.                                                                |
| 19:14      | Fortunately, LED lights nowadays are incredibly low power, but the bonus USB ports on mine           |
| 19:20      | are really good.                                                                                     |
| 19:21      | You can find a lot of USB Christmas decorations nowadays.                                            |
| 19:25      | And of course, they're not smart, but being able to control all of the USBs.                         |
| 19:30      | So this little USB fun things can turn on and off is pretty cool.                                    |
| 19:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 19:36      | And I would just add on to that.                                                                     |
| 19:38      | You made the point.                                                                                  |
| 19:39      | But LED lights, which are what most Christmas decorations are these days, are much lower             |
| 19:44      | voltage and wattage than historic, I'm sorry, they're much lower wattage.                            |
| 19:49      | I guess they'd be the same voltage, but they're much lower in their power demand.                    |
| 19:54      | So it's easier to string them together.                                                              |
| 19:56      | It's easier to put them on these relatively low amperage automation tools and you're not             |
| 20:01      | going to have any problem.                                                                           |
| 20:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 20:04      | I'm still a big fan of being able to individually control different sections just as I feel          |
| 20:08      | like I want to.                                                                                      |
| 20:10      | But depending on what people need, then maybe one of the $10, $15 smart plugs is a good              |
| 20:15      | idea or maybe you go a little bit out there and convince yourself to get the smart power             |
| 20:21      | strip because let's face it, you can always repurpose it after Christmas.                            |
| 20:25      | So you have now officially cost me money.                                                            |
| 20:27      | I just pushed the button.                                                                            |
| 20:28      | Excellent.                                                                                           |
| 20:29      | Excellent.                                                                                           |
| 20:30      | We've officially enabled David.                                                                      |
| 20:31      | I believe that means that every automator's listener gets five bonus points.                         |
| 20:35      | Gold star for Rose.                                                                                  |
| 20:36      | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| 20:37      | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| 20:38      | I get a gold star.                                                                                   |
| 20:39      | Everybody else gets five points and everybody knows points mean prizes.                              |

| 22:47      | I've got another one that I'm in the process of consolidating.                                       |
| 22:50      | It's called Yuletide and it's like the master shortcut of all Yuletide shortcuts for me.             |
| 22:59      | When I do that, it triggers all the lights, all the Christmas lights in the house and                |
| 23:04      | it starts playing my Christmas playlist.                                                             |
| 23:07      | It's like when I need good feelings, good holiday feelings, I just say, hey, who, Yuletide,          |
| 23:19      | and then everything goes off and I'm still working on things I can do with this.                     |
| 23:23      | Currently what I've got it doing is playing my Yuletide playlist out of music.                       |
| 23:27      | I'm directing it at my HomePods and I'm turning on the tree because we actually have                |
| 23:32      | two trees.                                                                                           |
| 23:33      | It's a long story, but we have two trees and we also have a little village.                          |
| 23:38      | I turn on all three of those things and music starts pumping.                                        |
| 23:44      | What more should I be doing with this Rose?                                                          |
| 23:46      | Well, I mean, I personally have multiple different playlists, which I use at this time of year.      |
| 23:55      | Essentially what I've done is I've built two core playlists.                                         |
| 23:58      | I've got Christmas music, which is more modern Christmas music, not carols primarily, and            |
| 24:05      | then I've got Christmas carols.                                                                      |
| 24:08      | I use these as a foundation for other playlists.                                                     |
| 24:13      | Now, I say this with a little caveat, which I recently discovered.                                   |
| 24:18      | If you create a smart playlist for music, which you have to do in the music app on the Mac,          |
| 24:24      | and you then want to see that smart playlist on iOS and your iPad and in CarPlay, you cannot         |
| 24:31      | use another playlist as a source.                                                                    |
| 24:35      | This was driving me completely and utterly bonkers until I figured it out.                           |
| 24:39      | What I did is I then selected all the things in those playlists and I just added a note              |
| 24:43      | to them that says Christmas or Christmas Carol.                                                      |
| 24:45      | Actually, I think I specifically added the note Christmas music, not Christmas, because              |
| 24:51      | otherwise I'm looking for contains Christmas and of course Christmas carols fall into that.          |
| 24:56      | Then I use these.                                                                                    |
| 24:59      | Earlier on in the year, as we record a four-year record, which is naturally before the share         |
| 25:04      | releases, I will allow Christmas music to be mixed in with the other music that I'm listening        |
| 25:11      | to.                                                                                                  |
| 25:13      | I don't necessarily want Christmas carols mixing into that unless I'm listening to my                |
| 25:18      | typical background music, which is, I guess, less upbeat is the wrong word, but it's usually         |
| 25:27      | a slower tempo and so on.                                                                            |
| 25:30      | Christmas carols are ideal to mix into that, exactly.                                                |
| 25:33      | Just because some of them are, but most of them aren't necessarily something that you're             |
| 25:37      | immediately going to stop what you're doing and sing along and dance to.                             |
| 25:43      | I mix those in and then as it gets closer to Christmas, then I will actually play those              |
| 25:48      | playlists as just that kind of music, which is quite nice, because then I have all of                |
| 25:55      | the options.                                                                                         |
| 25:56      | One of the things I have done recently is I have an automation with CarPlay where I get              |
| 26:01      | into the car and my phone connects to CarPlay.                                                       |
| 26:05      | It waits 30 seconds and checks if audio is playing.                                                  |
| 26:07      | If audio is not playing, then usually it would just start my driving playlist, but of course,        |
| 26:15      | it's getting Christmas, right?                                                                       |
| 26:17      | I love Christmas, so I've changed it and now it checks the month, and it gets the month,             |
| 26:23      | and if the month is December, then it's going to play my Christmas playlist instead.                 |
| 26:28      | I get Christmas music in the car automatically, but only in December, so in January it's not         |
| 26:33      | going to happen anymore, and I can forget about that until next year, at which point                 |
| 26:37      | it will start again.                                                                                 |
| 26:39      | The reason for the 30-second wait is sometimes I'll want to specifically select something,           |
| 26:45      | but I'm pretty good about doing that as soon as I get in the car.                                    |
| 26:50      | That's one thing I've done there, and I have to say quite like having that as options just           |
| 26:56      | because it allows me to sometimes, you know, sometimes if you're listening to music a lot,           |
| 27:01      | you get overloaded with the same Christmas songs playing everywhere, so by allowing it               |
| 27:06      | to mix with other regular music, it is less so over the top, and of course, I can play               |
| 27:13      | those plays anytime I like.                                                                          |
| 27:15      | My shortcut action, actually, I have a shortcut action, David, that I have on my home screen.        |
| 27:19      | Usually it shuffles a big playlist for me, but of course, I've changed that one as well              |
| 27:25      | because it's December to pick the one that allows Christmas music in there.                          |
| 27:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 27:32      | I do think there's something to be said for having a master holiday shortcut.                        |
| 27:37      | We've all seen those movies.                                                                         |
| 27:38      | There's always this movie with a cheesy bachelor, and he's got the lady coming over to his bachelor  |
| 27:44      | pad, and he pushes a button, and the disco ball starts up, and the very white music starts           |
| 27:51      | up.                                                                                                  |
| 27:52      | That's dumb, but I do think that there's a Christmas or a holiday version of that.                   |
| 27:59      | One of the things I was thinking about, maybe I want to do, because the one I have currently,        |
| 28:03      | all it does is turn on all the holiday lights and start music, but then I got thinking,              |
| 28:07      | well, it'd be kind of cool if it dimmed the rest of the lights in the house, but only                |
| 28:14      | in the evening, right?                                                                               |
| 28:15      | I mean, I guess that would probably, what would be the best way to do that?                          |
| 28:21      | I could do it on a time trigger, like if it's passed a certain hour to turn the lights               |
| 28:26      | down.                                                                                                |
| 28:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 28:28      | So the thing is, is if you want this to be part of the scene, are you using a shortcut               |
| 28:33      | for this?                                                                                            |
| 28:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 28:35      | Just a shortcut.                                                                                     |
| 28:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 28:37      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 28:38      | So then you can just add an if into that, and you get the time.                                      |
| 28:43      | So what I would probably do, I mean, if it's dark is one of those very difficult questions           |
| 28:49      | that is it dark, I don't know, but what you can do is you can use the weather.                       |
| 28:56      | And if you get your current weather, use that action to get your current weather.                    |
| 29:03      | And then you can say with something like sunset time, so get sunset time, and then you can           |
| 29:09      | say if it is before, and I believe you can then input your current date and time.                    |
| 29:16      | When you say before, it will automatically then give you a pop up to select the date.                |
| 29:21      | Don't do that.                                                                                       |
| 29:22      | Tap and hold on your date, and then you can set current date.                                        |
| 29:25      | So you can say if your sunset time is before current date, then you'll dim a light in that           |
| 29:32      | to do that.                                                                                          |
| 29:33      | So yes, that's how I would handle that one.                                                          |
| 29:36      | Although, because that's so contingent upon then the device going and finding the sunset             |
| 29:41      | time, and it's going to slow things down, the more I think about it, I think I'm just                |
| 29:46      | going to use if it's after 5 p.m. because that's why we could start here.                            |
| 29:50      | I don't need...                                                                                      |
| 29:51      | Exactly.                                                                                             |
| 29:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 29:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 29:54      | I mean, the good news is getting the current weather is usually incredibly quickly.                  |
| 29:59      | Usually does it really quickly because iOS, even if you don't use the weather app, does              |
| 30:02      | update this information in the background, which means that it's got it ready.                       |
| 30:07      | And so you can utilise that because for a long time that was how, David, I always got                |
| 30:13      | my current location because I would get the weather and then get my current location from            |
| 30:18      | the weather instead of doing get current location, but I'm pleased to report.                        |
| 30:22      | I was testing something recently and I found get current location is incredibly quick now.           |
| 30:26      | It's really good.                                                                                    |
| 30:27      | Something I'd love to hear from the listeners at the talk.automators.fm forum is what is             |
| 30:35      | your master holiday shortcut?                                                                        |
| 30:39      | What is your version of this?                                                                        |
| 30:41      | I remember a few years ago, everybody made their daily briefing shortcut.                            |
| 30:45      | Everybody had one where they'd get certain RSS feeds and they'd get the weather and the              |
| 30:50      | schedule for the day and everybody had a different version of that.                                  |
| 30:54      | I feel like this is another thing like that.                                                         |
| 30:56      | If you've got one or you're doing something fun with it, put it in the forums.                       |
| 31:00      | Maybe we'll come back to that.                                                                       |
| 31:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 31:03      | Put it in the forums and tell people what you're doing with it as well so they don't                 |
| 31:06      | have to just download your shortcut to figure it all out, especially because don't forget            |
| 31:11      | what looks to you like a perfectly formed shortcut when somebody else downloads it and               |
| 31:16      | they don't have your home kit home or the same apps installed, then a whole bunch of                 |
| 31:20      | things go missing.                                                                                   |
| 31:21      | As much as I don't like massive shortcuts that are just photos, do both.                             |
| 31:28      | Give people a link and either describe it or add some screenshots.                                   |
| 31:33      | You can always stitch them together with something like Pixel so that you don't have a thousand      |
| 31:38      | screenshots to upload just a few.                                                                    |
| 31:40      | All right, Rose, tell us about Twinkly Lights.                                                       |
| 31:44      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 31:45      | So, Twinkly Lights, they're something I got last year.                                               |
| 31:49      | They came up, I think I spotted them on Reddit, and basically they are the ultimate smart            |
| 31:55      | home lights.                                                                                         |
| 31:56      | When I say smart home lights, I mean, you put these on your tree or whatever it is because           |
| 32:02      | you don't have to put them on a tree, and then you scan them with your phone and it                  |
| 32:08      | maps them so that you can have a rainbow effect going from the top of your tree to the bottom        |
| 32:13      | of your tree or a spiral effect going up like a candy cane or something like that.                   |
| 32:20      | This is really cool.                                                                                 |
| 32:21      | There's a whole bunch of effects in the app.                                                         |
| 32:24      | Next year, to get them into [[HomeKit]], I had to use Homebridge, which is a service I've                |
| 32:28      | got running.                                                                                         |
| 32:29      | It basically goes, oh, right, these services aren't available in [[HomeKit]], but there was              |
| 32:34      | somebody who really wanted their Dyson fan or their Twinkly Lights in [[HomeKit]], so they               |
| 32:39      | wrote a plug-in to interact with the API, so you end up installing this little thing,                |
| 32:44      | and it works.                                                                                        |
| 32:45      | That's what I did last year, and that was fine.                                                      |
| 32:48      | This year, Twinkly has shipped a firmware update to the lights and they're [[HomeKit]] compatible        |
| 32:52      | now.                                                                                                 |
| 32:53      | My Twinkly Lights are now natively [[HomeKit]] compatible, which is fabulous, and I'm really             |
| 32:59      | excited by this because it means that I will be able to hopefully use [[HomeKit]] to set different       |
| 33:04      | scenes on my Christmas tree with rainbows and all of those things.                                   |
| 33:09      | Yeah, and it's really something else.                                                                |
| 33:13      | You have to go to the website to really appreciate to see the examples, but if you want your         |
| 33:20      | tree to have candy cane stripes, you can do that.                                                    |
| 33:23      | That's one of the basic ones they've already built in for you.                                       |
| 33:27      | Yes, yeah.                                                                                           |
| 33:28      | I will say Twinkly Lights are expensive.                                                             |
| 33:31      | I got mine on a Black Friday sale.                                                                   |
| 33:33      | Unfortunately, I think they've got a Black Friday sale this year, but this episode is                |
| 33:37      | releasing after that, but I would say, if you're excited by the idea of them, do look                |
| 33:41      | together on sale because they are pricey.                                                            |
| 33:44      | The other thing I would say is, as beautiful as all of their examples look when they're              |
| 33:48      | covered from head to toe in Twinkly Lights, obviously, Twinkly Marketing has a large budget          |
| 33:54      | for this stuff.                                                                                      |
| 33:55      | They can just go borrow the stuff and then hopefully sell it as refurbs afterwards.                  |
| 34:00      | What I've done on my tree is it already had lights.                                                  |
| 34:03      | It came pre-lit.                                                                                     |
| 34:04      | I left those on, and those go up in a spiral anti-clockwise, so I started at the bottom              |
| 34:11      | in the same spot and went up the tree clockwise in the opposite way, and then I just turned          |
| 34:16      | off the regular lights built into the tree to do the mapping because otherwise, of course,           |
| 34:20      | it gets confused because there are some lights that are permanently on while it's trying             |
| 34:24      | to do that.                                                                                          |
| 34:27      | You need to try and make sure that you don't have any other lights in the area when you              |
| 34:31      | map the tree or whatever it is that you put lights on, but it's amazingly cool.                      |
| 34:36      | I have to say, it is really nice being able to say, you know, I really want just these               |
| 34:41      | like five LEDs at the top of my tree to be this colour, and then I want the ones at the               |
| 34:46      | bottom of the tree to be that colour, and then I'm just going to like draw random hatches             |
| 34:49      | on the rest of it, and especially if you've got younger kids, letting them colour your                |
| 34:53      | Christmas tree is pretty cool, especially because you can easily save that so you can                |
| 34:58      | keep it for them, but then you can set it to something that you want once they've gone               |
| 35:02      | to bed.                                                                                              |
| 35:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 35:04      | I mean, if you want, I mean, these are really expensive.                                             |
| 35:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 35:08      | We keep saying that.                                                                                 |
| 35:09      | How much are they?                                                                                   |
| 35:10      | 250 lights are £99 here in the UK from Argus, where they are currently on sale.                      |
| 35:17      | If you look on the Twinkly website, then they list all the partners for the different kinds          |
| 35:24      | of things in different countries.                                                                    |
| 35:27      | So in the US, you can get them apparently on Amazon, and I am just looking right now                 |
| 35:33      | to see.                                                                                              |
| 35:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 35:35      | So on Amazon, you can get a 400 light pack, which is 19 linear feet of lights for $160               |
| 35:45      | as we record.                                                                                        |
| 35:46      | I don't know if that's a sale or not, and then you can get a two-pack for $320, and                  |
| 35:54      | I haven't bought these, and I probably won't, to be honest, but it's such a game changer             |
| 36:01      | with your tree if you, the way it works is just really fascinating.                                  |
| 36:06      | As an automator, I'm fascinated by the whole idea of it.                                             |
| 36:09      | You point the phone at it, and then it maps the lights based on where they're located                |
| 36:14      | after you string them on the tree, and then it's smart enough to coordinate and individually         |
| 36:19      | address each light to give you the patterns that you want.                                           |
| 36:22      | I mean, come on.                                                                                     |
| 36:23      | How can you not love that?                                                                           |
| 36:25      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 36:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 36:27      | They also do other kinds of lights, curtain lights, icicle lights.                                   |
| 36:29      | They do pre-lit trees and so on as well.                                                             |
| 36:32      | Those are quite expensive.                                                                           |
| 36:34      | I think they're $600 or something, which is crazy.                                                   |
| 36:37      | But they also recently released festoon lights, which are string lights that you leave outside       |
| 36:43      | all year round, which have large-coloured, I think they're G45-type bulbs on them.                    |
| 36:50      | There are the sort of things that you would see at events or permanent outdoor areas that            |
| 36:55      | maybe you go to a restaurant or a cafe that has that sort of thing hung up outside, and              |
| 37:01      | you can control those as well, which is quite nice.                                                  |
| 37:05      | I think those are currently sold out on Amazon in the US, but I've seen them in a couple             |
| 37:10      | of places, and they're really nice.                                                                  |
| 37:12      | If you want to go crazy with this stuff, then have a look at the sales for this or maybe             |
| 37:18      | wait until January for those, but I've certainly got a lot of enjoyment out of my twinkly lights.    |
| 37:25      | For me, it was worth it, but I did get them on sale.                                                 |
| 37:27      | Now, Rose, you've had yours a couple of years now?                                                   |
| 37:31      | The twinkly lights?                                                                                  |
| 37:32      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 37:33      | Yeah, I got them last year.                                                                          |
| 37:34      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 37:35      | And everything's working okay with them?                                                             |
| 37:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 37:37      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 37:38      | I did get them out this year.                                                                        |
| 37:39      | I got the whole box out because I attached them to the tree and then because it's a pre-lit          |
| 37:43      | tree, I just, I attached them in such a way that it meant that I could leave them on the             |
| 37:47      | tree.                                                                                                |
| 37:48      | And so I got them out, plugged them in, did the firmware update, everything works, and               |
| 37:52      | I put the box away again because it was a little too early to decorate at that point                 |
| 37:55      | and I was busy.                                                                                      |
| 37:57      | So I had to sadly put it away, but yeah, they seem to be working great.                              |
| 38:02      | And they do have the option to add a music controller so you can have them flash patterns            |
| 38:08      | in time with your music, which is an option that sometimes you want and sometimes you                |
| 38:13      | don't want.                                                                                          |
| 38:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 38:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 38:16      | But I mean, talking about, at the beginning of the show, I said, automation can really               |
| 38:21      | be used to impress this time of year, but just imagine like for your family, putting                 |
| 38:26      | these things on, not really telling them what you're doing.                                          |
| 38:29      | And when it's done, you start like turning your tree into a candy cane or whatever you               |
| 38:33      | want to do with it.                                                                                  |
| 38:34      | And I mean, that's kind of amazing, right?                                                           |
| 38:36      | I mean.                                                                                              |
| 38:37      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 38:38      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 38:39      | I hear frequently from listeners who say, oh, I love this stuff, but you know, my partner            |
| 38:43      | is not so interested in this.                                                                        |
| 38:44      | And I think that this is one of those things where, especially if you did manage to get              |
| 38:48      | them on sale, your partner will probably be the one egging you want to do it, just because           |
| 38:52      | they are pretty fun for things like that.                                                            |
| 38:56      | And even when you get bored of manually changing it all the time, you can select a series of         |
| 39:00      | scenes and have it cycle through them.                                                               |
| 39:04      | And so it will do the rainbow tree, then the candy cane tree, then the twinkly stars tree            |
| 39:08      | or whatever it is, and then go back, which is really nice for, I'm not, I don't want                 |
| 39:16      | to be playing with us all the time, but I want to have the option to play with it and                |
| 39:19      | have all the cool fun features, which, you know, you get with some truly smart lights.               |
| 39:26      | And I'm pleased with mine so far.                                                                    |
| 39:28      | They seem great.                                                                                     |
| 39:29      | And I've heard from other people that they love them as well.                                        |
| 39:33      | So I'm crossing my fingers that they continue to be as fabulous as they've been so far.              |

| 41:05      | All right, Rose, I have a holiday related automation challenge I want to share with you              |
| 41:11      | in the audience.                                                                                     |
| 41:13      | My wife loves Disney more than life itself.                                                          |
| 41:18      | And so she recently found online, you know, it's one of these COVID things where somebody            |
| 41:23      | got stuck home a long time so they made a product.                                                   |
| 41:26      | And I think it's 3D printed, but if you go to Disney World, they have these magic bands              |
| 41:33      | that you wear on your wrist.                                                                         |
| 41:34      | And I shared a couple of episodes ago that I, it's just an RFID, so I just, I trained                |
| 41:40      | shortcuts to read that as, you know, so now she can like open the Disney app on her phone            |
| 41:47      | by just tapping her wrist to her phone, you know, it's just a very simple shortcut automation.       |
| 41:52      | If it senses this, then open an app.                                                                 |
| 41:54      | I mean, it's a one step automation, but that got her thinking.                                       |
| 41:58      | And now, so this guy makes this product and it looks just like the readers, they have                |
| 42:04      | a Disney World, it's got like an LED light in it with a Mickey head and they've got different        |
| 42:08      | versions of it, but she bought the basic one that looks like the reader in Disney World.             |
| 42:14      | And all it is, is a reader and it's got a plug in it.                                                |
| 42:19      | And so what it does is it turns on a plug.                                                           |
| 42:22      | So it's kind of limited in terms of automation, like I can't address it to be a home kit.            |
| 42:28      | And I don't, I don't think there's really anything I can do with it, except she can                  |
| 42:32      | take her wrist and tap it against it and something will turn on.                                     |
| 42:36      | But I want to do something more with this.                                                           |
| 42:39      | And I don't know what that is, right?                                                                |
| 42:41      | Like I'm thinking like currently we could maybe hook it up to the second Christmas tree,             |
| 42:44      | but then it takes it off the automation path for me.                                                 |
| 42:47      | I don't really want to do that.                                                                      |
| 42:50      | But I need you automators to help me here.                                                           |
| 42:52      | What should I do with this thing?                                                                    |
| 42:54      | I mean, I guess my question is, is there a way to communicate with this?                             |
| 42:58      | No.                                                                                                  |
| 42:59      | Other than with the, the NFC tags?                                                                   |
| 43:01      | No, there isn't.                                                                                     |
| 43:02      | It's just a dumb reader.                                                                             |
| 43:04      | I mean, the, the one thing that definitely occurs to me is you could have, so assuming               |
| 43:10      | that this turns on and off a plug, you could have it turn on and off something, which then           |
| 43:16      | can send a signaled home kit that it's on, right?                                                    |
| 43:21      | Because then if it does that, then you can use that being on to trigger something else.              |
| 43:27      | Because if there, if there was a way to talk to this over Wi-Fi.                                     |
| 43:29      | What is there though?                                                                                |
| 43:30      | How does that work though?                                                                           |
| 43:31      | What home kit device will take?                                                                      |
| 43:34      | Well, no, I'm thinking of something where, you know, it usually, it would be on.                     |
| 43:40      | So say for example, it controls a lamp, okay?                                                        |
| 43:42      | And that lamp will get turned on and off, right?                                                     |
| 43:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 43:46      | But if it had a hue bulb in it and you didn't use the feature with the hue bulb to restore           |
| 43:51      | state after a power outage, then it being turned on, it would then automatically come                |
| 43:58      | on and then home kit can go, oh, this light has come on.                                             |
| 44:01      | Excellent.                                                                                           |
| 44:02      | I'm going to do this based on the light turning on.                                                  |
| 44:05      | The light turning on would be the trigger for home kit, right?                                       |
| 44:08      | But it is, it's definitely a challenge.                                                              |
| 44:12      | I mean, I have many, many ideas for how you could do something with that.                            |
| 44:16      | You could use something like an ESP32, which has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections.                    |
| 44:22      | But then you have to do electronics and programming to try and get something into this, which        |
| 44:29      | I think would be a challenge.                                                                        |
| 44:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 44:32      | I think I'd like to ideally turn it into a home kit trigger, you know, and maybe we                  |
| 44:38      | could put it near the front door or something.                                                       |
| 44:39      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 44:40      | She could walk in and tap it, I guess, assuming she's going to wear her magic band when she          |
| 44:48      | walks in it.                                                                                         |
| 44:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 44:50      | Or I don't know.                                                                                     |
| 44:51      | I mean, I'm sure it could read any number of these different things.                                 |
| 44:53      | But if you put a link in the show notes to the reader that she's bought or is looking                |
| 44:58      | at buying, then I'm sure people will certainly chime in with ideas.                                  |
| 45:01      | And I'm going to have to think about that as well, because I'm curious as to what might              |
| 45:05      | be doable with it.                                                                                   |
| 45:06      | And I bet there's a market.                                                                          |
| 45:10      | I mean, it's Disney stuff.                                                                           |
| 45:11      | Everybody loves Disney.                                                                              |
| 45:13      | And even, you know, though there's a lot of people who don't like Disney, there'll be                |
| 45:17      | somebody else who is super nerdy into home automation and wants to get this into home                |
| 45:23      | kit.                                                                                                 |
| 45:24      | Yeah, I feel like if I just turn it into a trigger, then I can do anything, right?                   |
| 45:29      | But I've got to figure out how to do that.                                                           |
| 45:32      | Because right now it's really just made to like turn on a lamp, and it seems so limited              |
| 45:37      | to me.                                                                                               |
| 45:38      | You know, I want more.                                                                               |
| 45:39      | But at the same time, this is the closest my wife has ever come to like being interested             |
| 45:43      | in automation.                                                                                       |
| 45:44      | So it's like, I want to make this work for her, you know, but I want to give her more                |
| 45:48      | power.                                                                                               |
| 45:49      | Did she get the Darth Vader magic band, Scanner David?                                               |
| 45:51      | No.                                                                                                  |
| 45:52      | Or did she get the...                                                                                |
| 45:53      | She just got the Mickey Mouse one, the basic one.                                                    |
| 45:54      | I can't have the dark side of my house.                                                              |
| 45:56      | What are you talking about?                                                                          |
| 45:57      | I mean, I was just checking.                                                                         |
| 45:58      | I was just checking.                                                                                 |
| 45:59      | Because there's, you know, I think I found the site on Etsy, where they've got all sorts             |
| 46:06      | of things.                                                                                           |
| 46:07      | So they've got a Mickey touchpoint one, they've got a haunted mansion, they do have a DeLorean       |
| 46:11      | time circuit.                                                                                        |
| 46:12      | DeLorean is not Disney people.                                                                       |
| 46:16      | Traveling Mickey, all sorts of things.                                                               |
| 46:17      | I'll put a link in the show notes.                                                                   |
| 46:19      | Yeah, it's an Etsy seller, and you found it.                                                         |
| 46:21      | And that's what they do.                                                                             |
| 46:22      | And it's a clever idea, but I just feel like, I don't know what I'm going to do with this            |
| 46:29      | thing.                                                                                               |
| 46:30      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 46:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 46:32      | I mean, I think that there's a way, because they have a, there was a, the way I found this           |
| 46:38      | actually is I ended up on a website, which linked me to them because they were telling               |
| 46:42      | how to build this yourself.                                                                          |
| 46:45      | And because, because you can build this yourself, I think you would be able to get a little creative |
| 46:54      | and put something together, but it's a question of what are you going to hook into it?               |
| 46:59      | And also, I just need to write the seller, because she bought, I wasn't involved with                |
| 47:05      | the purchase, but I need to write the seller.                                                        |
| 47:08      | Maybe they've got something, some ideas too.                                                         |
| 47:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 47:11      | I do have ideas for this, just because they, you won't be the first person who's asked               |
| 47:16      | if they could be hooked up with something, but yeah, I'm curious.                                    |
| 47:20      | I may end up having to go down a rabbit hole of watching all the videos here to, to get              |
| 47:25      | things set up.                                                                                       |
| 47:26      | It's a shame she didn't get the magic door, David.                                                   |
| 47:28      | That would have been, that would have been absolutely easier.                                        |
| 47:31      | The magic door.                                                                                      |
| 47:32      | I don't know what you're...                                                                          |
| 47:33      | There's a magic door scanner.                                                                        |
| 47:34      | Oh boy.                                                                                              |
| 47:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 47:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 47:37      | And there's Galaxy's Edge.                                                                           |
| 47:38      | You're going to end up with Galaxy's Edge one on your desk, I'm sure, but...                         |
| 47:40      | No, I'm not.                                                                                         |
| 47:41      | Although, I will say that Etsy does have a lot of interesting things.                                |
| 47:47      | So that's it.                                                                                        |
| 47:48      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 47:49      | Well, I ended up on the original website, put both the link to their Etsy store and their            |
| 47:53      | original website in the show notes for people, because there's choices as to where you get           |
| 47:59      | them from.                                                                                           |
| 48:00      | Though, I would say, don't forget, Etsy will take a cut out of whatever the store owns.              |
| 48:06      | So you might get a better deal going directly to their website, or at the very least, they'll        |
| 48:10      | get...                                                                                               |
| 48:11      | You know, they won't be charged for it.                                                              |
| 48:13      | So yeah, there's plenty of interesting things out there.                                             |
| 48:18      | I had not thought about using that sort of thing in your home, but looking on YouTube,               |
| 48:24      | there are people who've built magic band readers and connected them to their front door and          |
| 48:29      | things like that, so that they can unlock their door using their Disney magic band.                  |
| 48:32      | Again, there'll only be one person in my house wearing a magic band, so that's another thing.        |
| 48:38      | But the thing is, you can stick an NFC tag in the bottom of your phone case, not the                 |
| 48:43      | top of your phone case, but the bottom of your phone case.                                           |
| 48:46      | If you put it in the top of your phone case, then it's always going to read that NFC tag             |
| 48:51      | and you don't want that.                                                                             |
| 48:52      | But if you stick it in the bottom of your phone case, then you could use that on the                 |
| 48:57      | same kind of reader, because it's just an NFC tag.                                                   |
| 49:00      | Exactly.                                                                                             |
| 49:01      | All right, separate topic.                                                                           |
| 49:03      | It's also time to send out your holiday cards, and that opens up the whole thing that comes          |
| 49:11      | up in every nerd podcast about this time of year, is what's the latest tech to create                |
| 49:17      | a set of mailing labels or how are you going to get these holiday cards addressed fast               |
| 49:23      | and easy?                                                                                            |
| 49:25      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 49:26      | Well, before we dive too much into that, I do just want to say full props to my dad                  |
| 49:30      | who has been doing this for so long, I literally don't remember when he started, because he          |
| 49:36      | has been printing these mailing labels for years.                                                    |
| 49:40      | And recently he calculated he has three years of labels left in the box of labels that he            |
| 49:49      | bought over 20 years ago.                                                                            |
| 49:51      | So if you do want a cheap option, then you can just buy a box of labels.                             |
| 49:55      | And then I think you use this, David, there's an option to print mailing labels in Apple             |
| 50:02      | Contacts where it will then lay them all out on a sheet and you can customise that from              |
| 50:11      | Contacts only on the Mac.                                                                            |
| 50:13      | You can't do this from iOS, which is a bit of a shame, but it is pretty great to be                  |
| 50:18      | able to do that.                                                                                     |
| 50:19      | And one of the ways that I have made this much easier for myself is I've created a group             |
| 50:23      | in Contacts called Christmas, and then I put people in that group as I want to send them             |
| 50:29      | Christmas things.                                                                                    |
| 50:30      | I used to put the word Christmas in the notes, but then one of my friends moved to Christmas         |
| 50:35      | Lane and that became problematic.                                                                    |
| 50:37      | Fortunately, she was somebody I wanted to send a Christmas card to anyway, but living                |
| 50:41      | on Christmas Lane kind of breaks the...                                                              |
| 50:43      | I'll just search for the word Christmas and print all of these Contacts option that I                |
| 50:47      | had.                                                                                                 |
| 50:48      | So I'm now manually managing a group, which is fine.                                                 |
| 50:51      | Yeah, and I'll add to that, over the years I have tried to use kind of my own home-built             |
| 50:56      | tagging system in Contacts where you go in the notes field and just put hash referral,               |
| 51:03      | hash holiday card, hash whatever as an idea that you search for that, and then you've                |
| 51:08      | got a group.                                                                                         |
| 51:09      | I'll say that I...                                                                                   |
| 51:10      | And then you can actually also create a smart group based on that hash.                              |
| 51:14      | And that works, but I have come to the conclusion that Contacts really isn't made for this,          |
| 51:20      | and I do occasionally run into problems, and there are various problems.                             |
| 51:24      | Sometimes it just doesn't work, and I'm not really sure why.                                         |
| 51:27      | And I don't think the Contacts app gets a ton of love and attention from Apple.                      |
| 51:32      | So I don't know when they're going to get around updating it.                                        |
| 51:35      | So I just manually create these groups.                                                              |
| 51:38      | It is not that hard.                                                                                 |
| 51:39      | If you do a search and you have an existing tag system, you can create a manual group                |
| 51:44      | and just copy them in with one drag, and then you know forever exactly who is getting what.          |
| 51:52      | And that's just a little tip there from Sparky.                                                      |
| 51:55      | Exactly.                                                                                             |
| 51:56      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 51:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 51:58      | I like CodeHop on iOS for this because you can tap and hold on a contact and just select             |
| 52:01      | the groups right there, which is really easy when you've added a contact or if you're thinking       |
| 52:05      | about things to do that.                                                                             |
| 52:08      | And I want to give full props to Apple's Contacts here because when you print labels from Contacts,  |
| 52:14      | you can say that you want to print, for example, the company, that's a checkbox, but the country     |
| 52:20      | or region is an option, but underneath that you can say, except my country or region.                |
| 52:26      | So for example, I can include the country on all of the addresses except for those people            |
| 52:32      | living in the UK because I'm in the UK.                                                              |
| 52:35      | And that's really nice, and I like having that as an option just because you can do                  |
| 52:43      | all sorts of things.                                                                                 |
| 52:44      | And actually, I'm really glad that you did put this link in the show notes because it                |
| 52:49      | reminded me that as well as printing on a sheet of labels, which you can put through                 |
| 52:53      | any inkjet printer, it does work with my label printer as well because I have a label printer.       |
| 52:59      | At one point, I was addressing a lot of things and it made sense to buy a label printer.             |
| 53:05      | It's a brother one, it's a QL810W for anybody who's really curious, but it is meant for              |
| 53:10      | businesses who print labels, lots of labels.                                                         |
| 53:13      | So it is appropriately priced for that, unfortunately, but you can get cheaper label printers with   |
| 53:20      | just USB input, and of course you can print in the right format for those as well as defining,       |
| 53:28      | you can even define a custom label size as well in mail, which is really good.                       |
| 53:33      | And I don't know now if I'm going to use Contacts print or the Brother P-Touch software,               |
| 53:39      | which has, of course, a mail merge option to create labels with.                                     |
| 53:44      | Yeah, and this is all, we're sourcing this from an Apple article for this purpose, we'll             |
| 53:48      | put links in the show notes.                                                                         |
| 53:50      | The Apple Context app formats it automatically for Avery standard, Avery's a vendor here in          |
| 53:56      | the United States that makes basically labels that you can run through a printer and then            |
| 54:01      | unstick them.                                                                                        |
| 54:02      | But I believe, looking at the article, it also supports A4, which is probably what you               |
| 54:05      | would be using over in the UK.                                                                       |
| 54:09      | Can I just say that you guys have got the paper thing figured out?                                   |
| 54:12      | I mean, I don't know why.                                                                            |
| 54:13      | Yeah, A5 is half of A4, B5 is exactly halfway between A5 and A4, and so on and so forth.             |
| 54:20      | Its metric is wonderful.                                                                             |
| 54:22      | The only thing I'll complain about is the length of the piece of paper is 297 millimeters.           |
| 54:27      | Although I had it, and first there's a very interesting gray video about the paper sizes             |
| 54:36      | taken over there, we'll put a link to that in the show notes.                                        |
| 54:40      | The one thing, this is a total side thing, but one thing I do like about what I was taught           |
| 54:46      | as a kid is the English system, I don't know what we call it now, but the 12 base, like              |
| 54:51      | when I do carpentry, 12 base is very handy because a 12 base number system lets me cut               |
| 54:57      | it in thirds very easily, and a 10 base system does not, and that's my one complaint.                |
| 55:05      | I mean, we can use base 12 for dividing things evenly in thirds if we want to.                       |
| 55:12      | But honestly, if you buy a length of timber that is 30 centimeters and you need to cut               |
| 55:16      | it into 10 centimeter lengths, then that's thirds.                                                   |
| 55:21      | So it's never really something that's come up for me because it's easy to divide the                 |
| 55:26      | numbers because everything starts out with a nice brown number, which helps, except for              |
| 55:32      | the fact that we have this weird combination of metric and imperial, which means that we             |
| 55:36      | measure the distance that we drive in in miles, and the efficiency of our car in miles per           |
| 55:41      | gallon, and we buy our fuel in liters.                                                               |
| 55:43      | Oh, really?                                                                                          |
| 55:44      | I didn't know that.                                                                                  |
| 55:45      | Yeah, that's weird.                                                                                  |
| 55:46      | Yes, we buy our fuel in liters, which is just a whole other thing.                                   |
| 55:50      | But yes, we are getting sidetracked, but yes, fortunately, Apple contacts can print on A4            |
| 55:57      | or anything else, and you can define custom as well, which is quite important for those              |
| 56:02      | people who have maybe got labels, which aren't quite the same size as something else.                |
| 56:09      | The package that my dad has, I believe they were Avery, but that box of labels is over               |
| 56:14      | 20 years old now, and he thinks he's got three years left with it, judging by the number             |
| 56:18      | of Christmas cards that they send per year.                                                          |
| 56:20      | Originally, he also printed those labels to take on holiday, to stick on postcards.                  |
| 56:25      | But my parents then stopped doing postcards a few years ago.                                         |
| 56:29      | So that makes that easier.                                                                           |
| 56:32      | It's one less thing to do before you go on holiday, which is quite nice.                             |
| 56:36      | So in terms of gift tracking, every year, you've got gifts you buy for other people.                 |
| 56:43      | It's easy to lose track of that.                                                                     |
| 56:46      | The way Daisy and I handle it is we have a shared Apple note, and we just write people's             |
| 56:51      | names down and gifts, and there's a checkbox if we've already bought it or not, and I find           |
| 56:56      | that a very simple method that works great.                                                          |
| 57:00      | But I understand you've got something a little more complex.                                         |
| 57:03      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                          |
| 57:05      | Because I mean, it's pretty much just me buying these presents.                                      |
| 57:08      | I have, actually, I've got two systems.                                                              |
| 57:11      | One is for gifts coming in and one is for gifts going out.                                           |
| 57:14      | So because, especially thanks to a certain pandemic, my grandparents don't really leave              |
| 57:20      | the house anymore, my parents end up doing all of the Christmas shopping for gifts for               |
| 57:25      | them to me.                                                                                          |
| 57:27      | And so my parents understandably said, we have ideas, but we don't have that many ideas.             |
| 57:34      | Can you help us out?                                                                                 |
| 57:35      | So I created a wish list and I just did that as a shared note.                                       |
| 57:37      | Previously, my family's done this in various formats over the years.                                 |
| 57:41      | We tried using [Elfster](https://www.elfster.com/) and various other things, and this year, I just put it in a shared            |
| 57:46      | note and shared it with my parents, and there were zero complaints.                                  |
| 57:51      | They tapped on the link that they got in messages, were able to open it and see it, and then         |
| 57:56      | asked me questions based on the things that were in there.                                           |
| 57:58      | But it's essentially, it's an easy way of just sharing things that I would like with                 |
| 58:03      | them because, of course, they are apparently in the process of getting some of those.                |
| 58:11      | So yes, that's dealt with that side of things, which is always people going, what do you             |
| 58:16      | want?                                                                                                |
| 58:17      | Unfortunately, I have no automation to get that information out of your head into the note.          |
| 58:20      | That still requires some sitting down and thinking about things, but the other side                  |
| 58:25      | of things, for things that I'm buying, things that I'm wrapping, sending, delivering, etc.           |
| 58:31      | I went with [[Airtable]] because I love [[Airtable]] and it's infinitely powerful.                           |
| 58:37      | And I have to say, I'm really glad I did.                                                            |
| 58:38      | I tried this out last year.                                                                          |
| 58:40      | It was really useful for that, and then I've continued it this year.                                 |
| 58:46      | I rolled it over because for everybody that I have in my contacts, as somebody that I'm              |
| 58:55      | going to send a card to, I put them in the [[Airtable]] as well because then I can have an               |
| 58:59      | easy filter for whose card have I sent and also what status is their card in.                        |
| 59:04      | So this sounds ridiculous, but essentially, of course, the label is printed and then the             |
| 59:11      | card is written and then the card has been posted.                                                   |
| 59:14      | So for status, you're just using a single status field.                                              |
| 59:20      | Select.                                                                                              |
| 59:21      | Yeah, it's a single select, but this means that I can build a [[Kanban]] view for the cards.             |
| 59:28      | And that makes it really, really easy.                                                               |
| 59:30      | And the other thing I do is I have a checkbox for Get Christmas Card because there are people        |
| 59:35      | that get Christmas cards.                                                                            |
| 59:37      | And there are people that I may not get Christmas cards for.                                         |
| 59:39      | For example, my secret centre at work still needs to go through the gift process.                    |
| 59:43      | The gift is purchased.                                                                               |
| 59:44      | The gift has yet to arrive.                                                                          |
| 59:46      | And then I will be able to wrap the gift and deliver the gift.                                       |
| 59:49      | But that particular person doesn't.                                                                  |
| 59:50      | And for that single status field, are you using any automation to change status?                     |
| 59:54      | Are you doing that manually in [[Airtable]]?                                                             |
| 59:56      | No, no, I did look at trying to hook something up.                                                   |
| 59:59      | I do use Parcel to track all of my incoming deliveries.                                              |
| 01:00:03   | I previously used a great app called Deliveries.                                                     |
| 01:00:06   | I end up switching to Parcel because they have native Amazon integration, which is brilliant         |
| 01:00:11   | when you buy quite a few things from Amazon and they explicitly say set up mail rules                |
| 01:00:16   | to send us the delivery emails or batch emails and things like that, which is really good.           |
| 01:00:25   | So I use Parcel for that, but they don't have an API to get data out.                                |
| 01:00:29   | I consider building something where when I forward an email to Parcel, I also forward                |
| 01:00:33   | it to something else, like [[Make\|Integromat]] that goes and looks things up.                                 |
| 01:00:37   | And I immediately discarded that as this is way too complicated.                                     |
| 01:00:41   | And don't overcomplicate this.                                                                       |
| 01:00:42   | There aren't that many people that you give gifts to.                                                |
| 01:00:45   | So just don't do that and do it manually.                                                            |
| 01:00:49   | So there's no automation involved in updating the status of any of this there.                       |
| 01:00:54   | It's just a good old fashioned Rose goes in and clicks on the boxes.                                 |
| 01:00:59   | Well, I think we got that handled.                                                                   |
| 01:01:02   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:01:03   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:01:04   | I'm quite glad that I did because it means that I can have a combat view for either for              |
| 01:01:09   | cards and a separate one for presence.                                                               |
| 01:01:12   | And of course, I tend to send out my cards earlier rather than later, but then presence              |
| 01:01:17   | will go out fairly close to the actual holiday or be delivered to people in person.                  |
| 01:01:23   | So being able to get that good overview and see what's outstanding, I'm missing a present            |
| 01:01:29   | for this person.                                                                                     |
| 01:01:30   | You haven't got an idea yet.                                                                         |
| 01:01:31   | Well, okay, I guess I'll think about that and go to the washing up or something while                |
| 01:01:34   | I think about it.                                                                                    |
| 01:01:35   | Then, of course, get an idea just as you've sunk your hands into a bowl of soapy water.              |
| 01:01:40   | But it means that I get to feel in control of everything and put some automation notary              |
| 01:01:46   | into something that's already fun, which makes it more fun for me.                                   |
| 01:01:49   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:01:50   | We really don't do much automation in this.                                                          |
| 01:01:52   | I have the contacts database with a separate group for holiday cards.                                |
| 01:01:57   | And I keep that up to date as people move and change contact information.                            |
| 01:02:02   | So every year I print that out, my wife actually prefers to fill out the addresses by hand.          |
| 01:02:08   | I mean, she gets joy out of that.                                                                    |
| 01:02:11   | So I mean, there's no point.                                                                         |
| 01:02:12   | If it was up to me, it would be running through an Avery label, but I guess for us, thankfully,      |
| 01:02:19   | that's not the case.                                                                                 |
| 01:02:20   | She just fills them out by hand.                                                                     |
| 01:02:21   | And then, like I said, with gift tracking, we really just keep it simple, just a shared              |
| 01:02:27   | note.                                                                                                |
| 01:02:28   | And Apple Notes has got so much better at stuff like this.                                           |
| 01:02:30   | So I mean, in the years past, we had done databases and other solutions.                             |
| 01:02:36   | But now that Apple Notes is pretty reliable and shared notes are really easy, Daisy and              |
| 01:02:41   | I actually just have a shared folder.                                                                |
| 01:02:44   | Now that's a new thing you can do as of, I think, last year.                                         |
| 01:02:47   | So in Apple Notes, we have a shared folder.                                                          |
| 01:02:49   | And then I can add any document to that shared folder.                                               |
| 01:02:52   | And we don't have to go through the process of hooking up a sync for each new note.                  |
| 01:02:57   | It's just part of that folder.                                                                       |
| 01:02:59   | Exactly.                                                                                             |
| 01:03:00   | But yeah, shared folders for things like that are wonderful.                                         |
| 01:03:02   | You could, of course, for yourself create some automations to easily append something                |
| 01:03:08   | to a particular note if you wanted to do that.                                                       |
| 01:03:11   | But at the same time, if it's easy enough to do as it is, then it works.                             |
| 01:03:15   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:03:16   | I mean, at this point, it's like you open it up and hit the dictation button and say                 |
| 01:03:20   | Lego.                                                                                                |
| 01:03:21   | And then you're good, you know, because I'm always looking for it.                                   |
| 01:03:24   | Let's face it.                                                                                       |
| 01:03:25   | Lego is the answer for everybody.                                                                    |
| 01:03:26   | I've got a little nephew.                                                                            |
| 01:03:27   | He's like five now.                                                                                  |
| 01:03:28   | I'm like, I'm getting him his first like big boy Lego, you know, I've been his supplier              |
| 01:03:34   | in the past, but now we're past Duplo now and I can't wait.                                          |
| 01:03:39   | And you know, Lego does this cool thing now.                                                         |
| 01:03:42   | I didn't realise it till just when I went shopping, but they have, they have like, he's              |
| 01:03:47   | really an animal.                                                                                    |
| 01:03:48   | So I'm getting him the kind of the wild animal thing.                                                |
| 01:03:52   | And they've got one with the upper age of I think four or five and one with the upper                |
| 01:03:57   | age of six or seven.                                                                                 |
| 01:03:59   | And just even though they're the same format, you know, the standard size of Lego, if you            |
| 01:04:03   | look at the box, the pieces are just a little bit more together already.                             |
| 01:04:08   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:04:09   | So I think it's like perfect for him at where he's at right now, developmentally, I think            |
| 01:04:13   | he's going to love these.                                                                            |
| 01:04:14   | They're going to be enough of a challenge that he's going to have to work at it, but                 |
| 01:04:18   | it's not going to be overwhelming to him.                                                            |
| 01:04:21   | And yeah, it's not going to be a challenge that he's not able to complete and gets frustrated        |
| 01:04:24   | because of that.                                                                                     |
| 01:04:25   | That's, that's one of the gifts I'm really looking forward to giving this year.                      |
| 01:04:28   | Anyway.                                                                                              |
| 01:04:29   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:04:30   | Boy, we are going off on tangents today.                                                             |
| 01:04:31   | Are we?                                                                                              |
| 01:04:32   | I mean, it's the holidays.                                                                           |
| 01:04:34   | Part of the fun of the holidays is seeing where you end up with despite perhaps large                |
| 01:04:39   | amounts of planning or little planning, just because there are so many options of things             |
| 01:04:44   | that you can do.                                                                                     |

| 01:04:58   | In my other life, I spend a lot of time advising small companies.                                    |
| 01:05:01   | And even though you may be an expert in whatever it is you make, getting started in business         |
| 01:05:06   | isn't easy and getting advice from bankers is golden.                                                |
| 01:05:11   | Cadence Bank came up with this excellent podcast called In Good Companies to help small and          |
| 01:05:16   | mid-sized businesses show people how to turn their passions into their livelihood.                   |
| 01:05:21   | But owning a business comes with a whole host of questions like, how do you get started              |
| 01:05:25   | and what type of loan is right for you?                                                              |
| 01:05:28   | Do federal reserve policies affect your business and when should you create a succession plan?       |
| 01:05:33   | And that's where Cadence Bank can help you.                                                          |
| 01:05:35   | On their podcast, In Good Companies, they put together their extensive knowledge to guide            |
| 01:05:40   | you through the life cycle of business from start to sale.                                           |
| 01:05:44   | If you have a business or thinking of starting one, this podcast will give you the strategies        |
| 01:05:49   | you need to navigate those opportunities and the financial and managerial tools you'll               |
| 01:05:54   | need.                                                                                                |
| 01:05:55   | I listened to one of their recent episodes called New Beginnings and Getting Ready to                |
| 01:05:59   | Start Your Business and it answered a bunch of questions about things like small business            |
| 01:06:04   | loans and creating your first business plan and the five C's of credit.                              |
| 01:06:09   | These are things that people interested in starting a new business absolutely need to                |
| 01:06:13   | understand.                                                                                          |
| 01:06:14   | Guests Alan Toms and Alan Adams were excellent in explaining how these things work for you.          |
| 01:06:20   | It's very easy for bankers to get highly technical when talking to people, but the                   |
| 01:06:25   | way they did this podcast was not that.                                                              |
| 01:06:27   | Instead, they brought everything down to very understandable terms and concepts.                     |
| 01:06:33   | Anybody listening to this could get an idea of how to start their business.                          |
| 01:06:36   | If you're thinking about striking out on your own, listen to this show.                              |
| 01:06:41   | Creating a new business isn't easy.                                                                  |
| 01:06:43   | It's so much more than just making the widget.                                                       |
| 01:06:46   | You need to understand how to run a business, how to work with a bank and position yourself          |
| 01:06:50   | to succeed.                                                                                          |
| 01:06:51   | This podcast explains things like bulletproof business plans, funding options and how to             |
| 01:06:56   | develop relationships with key stakeholders.                                                         |
| 01:06:59   | The most impressive thing about this show for me was the conversational nature of the discussion,    |
| 01:07:05   | but the very dense and useful information it conveyed.                                               |
| 01:07:09   | It's not an easy tightrope to walk and they do an excellent job of it.                               |

| 01:07:28   | Our thanks to In Good Companies for the support of the Automators podcast and all of RelayFM.        |
| 01:07:35   | We've been talking automation throughout the show.                                                   |
| 01:07:38   | One thing I would like to talk about since we are at the holidays is giving the gift                 |
| 01:07:43   | of automation.                                                                                       |
| 01:07:45   | If you're listening to the show, you like automation.                                                |
| 01:07:47   | How can you share the love of automation with other people?                                          |
| 01:07:51   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:07:52   | I actually have a great example, fortunately, which my parents are really thrilled with              |
| 01:07:57   | because I gave them the gift of automation last year and I will continue to give them                |
| 01:08:00   | the gift of automation for many years to come because once you bring people in and they're           |
| 01:08:05   | interested and excited by things and it works, then you get to keep giving it.                       |
| 01:08:09   | So it is the gift that keeps on giving in that perspective because my parents actually,              |
| 01:08:14   | so last year in the summer, got smart blinds, IKEA blinds for the upstairs of their house.           |
| 01:08:21   | So I talked them into getting the smart hub so that it will close and open like blinds               |
| 01:08:26   | together and so on and so forth, which was great and it does things as well.                         |
| 01:08:30   | If they're not at home, then it automatically closes and opens them at certain times and             |
| 01:08:35   | if they are at home, then it only opens the bedroom blinds when they told it to open them,           |
| 01:08:39   | but otherwise, things continue as normal.                                                            |
| 01:08:42   | That was a good start, but then I decided, let's enhance their automation options a little           |
| 01:08:47   | bit and I got them two IKEA smart plugs and a remote for it because they already had the             |
| 01:08:53   | home hub and I was able to set it up so that the lights in their living room turn on and             |
| 01:08:58   | off automatically for them, but they've still got a physical control, which is something             |
| 01:09:02   | that if you're giving the gift of automation, you need to think, okay, well, if it's not             |
| 01:09:07   | working, how are they going to do this?                                                              |
| 01:09:09   | So giving them a physical remote control that they could just press the buttons on was a             |
| 01:09:13   | necessary part of that, which I'm glad I did.                                                        |
| 01:09:16   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:09:17   | I think that like there's like getting people started with this stuff, there's an art to             |
| 01:09:21   | that, right?                                                                                         |
| 01:09:22   | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 01:09:23   | Like blind opening to me really was pretty aggressive as the first.                                  |
| 01:09:26   | Well, my parents were the ones that decided to do that.                                              |
| 01:09:29   | I wasn't involved in that other than the fact that they saw me installing smart blinds               |
| 01:09:33   | in my house after I bought it and everything.                                                        |
| 01:09:37   | And then went, oh, this is really cool.                                                              |
| 01:09:40   | This would be really good.                                                                           |
| 01:09:41   | We're going to get this.                                                                             |
| 01:09:42   | And so they went to IKEA and bought some smart blinds.                                               |
| 01:09:45   | If they hadn't done that, I would have had to get them a hub as well, because that is                |
| 01:09:50   | one of the things to bear in mind, how many ethernet ports does this person have on their            |
| 01:09:56   | router modem, because if they don't have ethernet ports, then you're going to have to be a little    |
| 01:10:01   | careful about what kind of things you give people.                                                   |
| 01:10:03   | And so sometimes maybe giving Wi-Fi plugs is a better option for things like that.                   |
| 01:10:08   | But fortunately, my parents had already gone down the blinds rabbit hole there and they              |
| 01:10:12   | were very happy with that, that was working.                                                         |
| 01:10:16   | And so I enhanced that by giving them a couple of smart plugs and a remote control.                  |
| 01:10:22   | And then I was able to increase that this year because I gave them the smart plugs that              |
| 01:10:26   | I used last year for my tree and lights and the remote for it.                                       |
| 01:10:30   | So now their tree and lights will also be smart controlled, but they've got a little                 |
| 01:10:37   | button that they can use on that to turn that on and off manually if they want to.                   |
| 01:10:41   | Or it turns out my parents love talking to their Apple Watches, so that's what they                  |
| 01:10:45   | do most of the time.                                                                                 |
| 01:10:46   | Yeah, I think that lights are a great kind of entry point because it's just so obvious,              |
| 01:10:53   | they turn off and on.                                                                                |
| 01:10:55   | And the trick is just finding a solution for them.                                                   |
| 01:10:59   | And I really think one of the best ways to do it, if you have the ability and if they                |
| 01:11:03   | live in circumstances where you can, is getting someone like a switch, get a Lutron Casetaa         |
| 01:11:12   | switch and maybe like a door trigger.                                                                |
| 01:11:16   | I feel like, so you're in for under a hundred bucks to have one Lutron switch and a door             |
| 01:11:22   | trigger.                                                                                             |
| 01:11:23   | And that way they've got the ability to turn the light off and on as they always did.                |
| 01:11:29   | So you're not taking away anything.                                                                  |
| 01:11:31   | And then you've got the ability for them to use their phone to turn things off and on,               |
| 01:11:36   | which I think they'll dig.                                                                           |
| 01:11:38   | And then you've got the ability of them to have that moment of light when they walk in               |
| 01:11:42   | and it's dark out and the lights turn on as the door opens.                                          |
| 01:11:46   | And I think, you know, if you can do something like that, I think you're good.                       |
| 01:11:50   | And but it seems to me like lights are kind of the entry point for this stuff.                       |
| 01:11:55   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:11:56   | The only thing I'll say about something like the Lutron Casetaa is that's kind of light             |
| 01:11:59   | switch that you install in a wall.                                                                   |
| 01:12:02   | And so if you're going to do that, you probably want to install it yourself.                         |
| 01:12:05   | Oh yeah.                                                                                             |
| 01:12:06   | Definitely.                                                                                          |
| 01:12:07   | I'm sorry.                                                                                           |
| 01:12:08   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:12:09   | Which is both, you know, good and bad.                                                               |
| 01:12:11   | And of course, don't forget with all of these things, if you give the gift, then unfortunately       |
| 01:12:15   | you are then responsible whenever anything breaks, even if it's theoretically completely             |
| 01:12:19   | unrelated.                                                                                           |
| 01:12:20   | My Internet's not working.                                                                           |
| 01:12:21   | You did that smart thing.                                                                            |
| 01:12:22   | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| 01:12:23   | You're going to have to watch out for that.                                                          |
| 01:12:24   | So if you've got somebody who'll blame you for their internet being out already, then                |
| 01:12:28   | definitely don't give them the gift of home automation unless they've already started trying         |
| 01:12:32   | to look for stuff in which case, make sure they get some good stuff.                                 |
| 01:12:34   | And you're going to show up for the holiday with a gift and then in your bag, you're going           |
| 01:12:38   | to have a screwdriver and a wire stripper.                                                           |
| 01:12:40   | So you know.                                                                                         |
| 01:12:41   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:12:42   | Exactly.                                                                                             |
| 01:12:43   | So that you can do it yourself.                                                                      |
| 01:12:44   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:12:45   | Definitely.                                                                                          |
| 01:12:46   | And for people who, you know, they trust you, they love you, but they don't want you taking          |
| 01:12:50   | out their light switches.                                                                            |
| 01:12:51   | For that sort of thing, that's where I would go for the smart wall plug where it just sits           |
| 01:12:56   | in between a lamp and the wall and turns things on and off because then they can still press         |
| 01:13:01   | the button on the wall switch to turn it on and off.                                                 |
| 01:13:06   | I'm assuming that you get a smart plug that's got a button on it for this.                           |
| 01:13:11   | And then they've got, you know, the other options as well.                                           |
| 01:13:15   | But what I'm doing for my parents this year, David, because they've fallen in love with              |
| 01:13:20   | automation a little bit over the last year with the lights that come on automatically                |
| 01:13:24   | when they arrive home, if it's after dark and they turn on automatically at sunset.                  |
| 01:13:30   | So my parents, however, have discovered over the last month or so that sunset is not when            |
| 01:13:34   | it's dark.                                                                                           |
| 01:13:35   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:13:36   | As in it gets dark before sunset.                                                                    |
| 01:13:38   | And so what I'm doing this year is a car, I have a new hub.                                          |
| 01:13:42   | It's an E1 hub and it just looks like a long USB stick.                                              |
| 01:13:45   | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 01:13:46   | So it's a really small hub, which is great because it means that you can plug it in pretty           |
| 01:13:49   | much anywhere.                                                                                       |
| 01:13:50   | It's USB.                                                                                            |
| 01:13:51   | So it's operating over Wi-Fi, which, you know, has pros and cons.                                    |
| 01:13:56   | But I'm planning on setting this stuff up in my parents' living room.                                |
| 01:14:00   | So I'm getting them an Aqara hub, an E1 hub, a motion sensor, and a light sensor, a luminance        |
| 01:14:07   | sensor.                                                                                              |
| 01:14:08   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:14:09   | Because this way, if they're at home and there's movement in the living room and it's                |
| 01:14:14   | below a certain light level and the light level is a bit that I'm going to have to play              |
| 01:14:19   | with and try and set up, then it can turn those lights on.                                           |
| 01:14:23   | It can just turn on the lamps that I already set up and automated for them last year.                |
| 01:14:27   | It'll turn those on.                                                                                 |
| 01:14:29   | And that is something that they've kind of mentioned.                                                |
| 01:14:32   | It'll be really nice if the lights turned on, you know, just when it got dark.                       |
| 01:14:36   | And so I'm getting them a motion sensor and a separate luminance sensor to do that with.             |
| 01:14:41   | I did look at the Philips Hue for this because Philips Hue motion sensors have a lux sensor         |
| 01:14:46   | or a luminance sensor built into them.                                                               |
| 01:14:49   | But the problem with that is I was going to have to get them a Philips Hue hub to get                |
| 01:14:53   | them a Philips Hue light sensor.                                                                     |
| 01:14:56   | And that didn't seem like a particularly great combination for a number of reasons.                  |
| 01:15:01   | Not only price, because the Philips Hue hub has to be connected by Ethernet and they're              |
| 01:15:07   | out of Ethernet ports.                                                                               |
| 01:15:09   | And the last time I tried putting an Ethernet switch in there, there were mutterings, lots           |
| 01:15:13   | of mutterings.                                                                                       |
| 01:15:14   | It was an interesting conversation, trying to explain that actually Ethernet is better               |
| 01:15:18   | than the Wi-Fi sometimes.                                                                            |
| 01:15:20   | So I've gone with the Aqara E1 hub because you just need to plug it into USB somewhere               |
| 01:15:24   | for power and that's it.                                                                             |
| 01:15:27   | And yeah, and this means that of course, then I can get them and I have got them some temperature    |
| 01:15:32   | and humidity sensors.                                                                                |
| 01:15:33   | Just because it's nice to have those scattered around the house, they're very small squares.         |
| 01:15:39   | They just use a coin cell battery.                                                                   |
| 01:15:41   | But if I put those around the house, then they'll know what the temperature is in different          |
| 01:15:44   | rooms.                                                                                               |
| 01:15:45   | Because my dad's been mentioning, it feels like my mom's office is a lot colder than                 |
| 01:15:49   | some of the other rooms upstairs.                                                                    |
| 01:15:50   | So I'll be giving them the ability to determine this with very, very tiny sensors, which is          |
| 01:15:57   | hopefully something that will benefit them.                                                          |
| 01:15:59   | Yeah, that's nice.                                                                                   |
| 01:16:00   | And the E1 hub is just 30 bucks on Amazon in the United States.                                      |
| 01:16:04   | It's a very easy way, like low barrier of entry.                                                     |
| 01:16:08   | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 01:16:09   | The only thing I'll say is when they first released the E1 hub, it was only available                |
| 01:16:15   | on the Chinese Aqara server or in [[HomeKit]] only mode, I believe.                                      |
| 01:16:21   | And now it should be available in [[HomeKit]] mode everywhere because they are advertising               |
| 01:16:24   | it with [[HomeKit]] mode.                                                                                |
| 01:16:25   | So just double check the Aqara website first to make sure that it is in [[HomeKit]] mode.                |
| 01:16:30   | But I'm 99% certain it is available for [[HomeKit]] on the UK, EU and US servers.                        |
| 01:16:39   | So yeah, but it's pretty great.                                                                      |
| 01:16:41   | And the Aqara stuff is very affordable as well, which makes it a really good gift because            |
| 01:16:46   | then if they decide that they want some more temperature sensors, it's going to be easy              |
| 01:16:49   | to get them.                                                                                         |
| 01:16:50   | Yeah, door sensors are $15.                                                                          |
| 01:16:54   | Temperature sensors.                                                                                 |
| 01:16:55   | And they're really small.                                                                            |
| 01:16:56   | They are really small.                                                                               |
| 01:16:57   | Temperature sensors, $16.                                                                            |
| 01:16:58   | I mean, once you get the hub, this is a very affordable way to get more triggers into your           |
| 01:17:06   | automation.                                                                                          |
| 01:17:07   | Exactly, yes.                                                                                        |
| 01:17:09   | And of course, as well as giving the gift of automation, you can be receiving the gift               |
| 01:17:12   | of automation.                                                                                       |
| 01:17:13   | So if you're looking for some ideas of some things that people could get you, things like            |
| 01:17:17   | the door sensor and window sensor are really good.                                                   |
| 01:17:20   | Aqara also sell a vibration sensor, which I have stuck to the back of my office chair.               |
| 01:17:25   | And this is one of the ways that I tell whether or not my office is occupied because the motion      |
| 01:17:31   | sensor on my chair is much more likely to pick up some movement while I'm sitting here               |
| 01:17:34   | recording a podcast than the other motion sensors, which are traditional motion sensors              |
| 01:17:39   | because the vibration sensor, of course, is more sensitive.                                          |
| 01:17:42   | So yeah, there's certainly a lot of options that you can give people.                                |
| 01:17:47   | And I'm hoping that the motion sensor, we may have to play a little bit with positioning             |
| 01:17:51   | to find a good spot to put it in where it can always see people, but my parents don't                |
| 01:17:56   | feel like it's obtrusive.                                                                            |
| 01:17:59   | But the Aqara things are very small, which makes it much easier to stow a motion sensor              |
| 01:18:06   | somewhere.                                                                                           |
| 01:18:07   | And the light sensor I'll be putting on the windowsill to get an appropriate and accurate            |
| 01:18:11   | light reading.                                                                                       |
| 01:18:12   | Yeah, another really affordable Aqara sensor is a water leak detector for $18.                       |
| 01:18:16   | I mean, if you've got something that could leak water, you're washing machine, your dishwasher,      |
| 01:18:24   | things like that.                                                                                    |
| 01:18:25   | I've got one.                                                                                        |
| 01:18:26   | There's a side storage cupboard here, which I rent from the complex that I live in, but              |
| 01:18:32   | it's level with the path outside.                                                                    |
| 01:18:35   | So theoretically, susceptible to flooding.                                                           |
| 01:18:38   | So everything in there, I've got a suspended floor.                                                  |
| 01:18:42   | I just put some decking tiles down, basically to get everything up a little bit, but I put           |
| 01:18:48   | a water leak sensor in there underneath the decking to be clear, just to give me a heads             |
| 01:18:53   | up early warning if there is some water going in there that I should possibly check things           |
| 01:18:58   | out and buy a boat.                                                                                  |
| 01:19:01   | But so far, I've not been informed that I need to buy a boat or that water is entering               |
| 01:19:05   | there.                                                                                               |
| 01:19:06   | So that's really good.                                                                               |
| 01:19:07   | See, now the fact that I know this exists for $18, it's like, and if someday I do have               |
| 01:19:13   | a water problem, I'm going to be really upset that I didn't do this.                                 |
| 01:19:16   | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 01:19:17   | The only thing I'll say is if you're looking at getting an Aqara hub for yourself, check             |
| 01:19:21   | the number of devices that can be paired with the hub, the E1 has got a lower number of              |
| 01:19:25   | devices that can be paired with it compared to the other hubs.                                       |
| 01:19:28   | The M2 can pair 128 sensors.                                                                         |
| 01:19:31   | I started out with the M1S, which has a limit of 32, and you probably go 32, that's so               |
| 01:19:36   | many sensors.                                                                                        |
| 01:19:37   | Once you add door sensors to most of your doors and your windows, and then you add a                 |
| 01:19:42   | vibration sensor to the back of your office chair and so on and so forth, you very quickly           |
| 01:19:46   | reach that number.                                                                                   |
| 01:19:48   | So I would recommend potentially looking at one of their hubs.                                       |
| 01:19:53   | They do some cameras, which are also hubs as well.                                                   |
| 01:19:57   | So if you're looking for a home kit camera, then you can get a home kit camera that is               |
| 01:20:02   | also in Aqara hub and do a 2-in-1, and those compare 64 devices with them.                           |
| 01:20:07   | So that's quite nice.                                                                                |
| 01:20:08   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:20:09   | And the other thing is, all the Aqara stuff is home kit compatible, which means all of               |
| 01:20:14   | these sensors become triggers in a home kit without having to go to any other third party            |
| 01:20:18   | options.                                                                                             |
| 01:20:19   | So that's nice.                                                                                      |
| 01:20:20   | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 01:20:21   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:20:22   | And then what I love is I set everything up in home kit, and I use this great app called             |
| 01:20:25   | controller for home kit, and I just, whenever I've been doing some tweaking and playing              |
| 01:20:30   | with any of my home kit stuff, I back everything up just in case, because every software on          |
| 01:20:34   | home kit gets this, I don't know, it gets it into a weird headspace, and it creates this             |
| 01:20:39   | default room and moves things around.                                                                |
| 01:20:41   | Well, by doing backups on a regular basis, when I've been playing with things and setting            |
| 01:20:46   | up scenes and stuff, I've just found that this ends up being a non-issue, because I                  |
| 01:20:50   | can always restore it.                                                                               |
| 01:20:51   | Though I have to say, it's not moved things into a default room in quite some time, which            |
| 01:20:55   | I'm very pleased about.                                                                              |
| 01:20:57   | All right.                                                                                           |
| 01:20:59   | That's it, guys.                                                                                     |
| 01:21:00   | I mean, I think you want to get somebody automated.                                                  |
| 01:21:02   | I think we've given you some options.                                                                |
| 01:21:04   | Before we go, Rose, I just want to take a minute to check in on shortcuts for Mac, because           |
| 01:21:09   | this is almost like a news story, even though we don't really do news stories here.                  |
| 01:21:13   | But I don't know if you've been keeping up with the betas, I'm sure you have.                        |
| 01:21:17   | But the shortcuts for Mac seems to be undergoing a massive change right now.                         |
| 01:21:23   | Do you see it the same way?                                                                          |
| 01:21:24   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:21:25   | It certainly feels like it, though I have to say that in recent times, I've been spending            |
| 01:21:29   | less time on my beta laptop, because of course, I've already got Monterey installed on my            |
| 01:21:33   | iMac, and I've got the public release on here, because I don't want any of my podcast                |
| 01:21:36   | co-hosts to wish to murder me because of any technology problems while recording.                    |
| 01:21:41   | So I feel like I've not been as on top of this as I ought to have been, perhaps.                     |
| 01:21:45   | Yeah, because there's a lot of stuff that is broken and slow.                                        |
| 01:21:50   | I mean, underlying it is they wrote this in [[SwiftUI]], which is a new programming environment,         |
| 01:21:57   | and I'm sure that the fact that Shortcuts team is using this is making [[SwiftUI]] better                |
| 01:22:03   | or faster.                                                                                           |
| 01:22:06   | I don't know what's going on, but it feels like it's getting better now, but it's also               |
| 01:22:10   | changing.                                                                                            |
| 01:22:11   | I'm in the midst of making the Shortcuts for Mac field guide, and I think I may have to              |
| 01:22:15   | just stop for a minute and let them catch up.                                                        |
| 01:22:19   | That is exactly the problem I've run into as well, because I've been trying to update,               |
| 01:22:23   | take control of Shortcuts, and I've basically ended up having to stop because there are              |
| 01:22:27   | several things that are broken, and they're fixed in one beta, and then they break it,               |
| 01:22:32   | get in the next beta, and so on and so forth.                                                        |
| 01:22:35   | And then the Mac is undergoing these changes, which is a good thing.                                 |
| 01:22:40   | I'm really pleased that the Shortcuts team are on this, and they're working really hard.             |
| 01:22:44   | And I have to say, Omni Group have been doing, it's more of an alpha than a beta, to be honest,       |
| 01:22:51   | of OmniFocus 4, and that's in [[SwiftUI]], and they've been running into issues with [[SwiftUI]],            |
| 01:22:57   | which are things crash, and it's not because Omni Group have necessarily programmed things            |
| 01:23:02   | wrong, it's because of [[SwiftUI]], and they've said this several times over the beta, you               |
| 01:23:08   | know, like, there's a [[SwiftUI]] bug here, we're working on trying to get it fixed with Apple,          |
| 01:23:13   | but they're having to write some things in AppKit to go around that, or UIKit, and so                |
| 01:23:21   | on, which is just, you know, it's less than ideal, and I wonder if the Shortcuts team have           |
| 01:23:25   | run into the same issue, or let's face it, they've got an inside line, right, to the                 |
| 01:23:30   | folks who write, who are in charge of the [[SwiftUI]] for work, so I'm pretty certain they're            |
| 01:23:35   | getting some things fixed for them, which is nice, but yeah, I'm crossing my fingers,                |
| 01:23:39   | this continues, because it's good to see changes.                                                    |
| 01:23:42   | Yeah, well, we're going to be talking about it more when things settle, but I think the              |
| 01:23:46   | good news is, is getting a lot better, and I think it's going to be more of a kind of                |
| 01:23:52   | a team player on the Mac, because it's felt very much like an iOS app on the Mac, up until           |
| 01:23:57   | now, but it's just kind of in this weird space, so if you're struggling with Shortcuts on            |
| 01:24:03   | the Mac right now, hang in there, I think it's going to get better.                                  |
| 01:24:06   | Yes, I have to say, I've definitely struggled with it in some ways, just because, like,              |
| 01:24:12   | for example, inserting a variable, like you end up right clicking Insert Variable, and               |
| 01:24:18   | the list kind of looks like an iOS-ish list, and I don't quite understand why my brain               |
| 01:24:23   | thinks that, I think it's the images next to each one, but if there weren't the images               |
| 01:24:26   | next to each one, then I would definitely struggle to recognise it, so yeah, it's good               |
| 01:24:31   | that things are improving, which is nice.                                                            |
| 01:24:33   | There's all kinds of weird things, like if you put, because they have a menu bar icon,               |
| 01:24:36   | if you put too many Shortcuts in the menu bar, it's very slow to move the cursor down                |
| 01:24:43   | that list, and it's just like just weird things, and I just think it's, you know, they're            |
| 01:24:49   | realising that the Mac is a different platform than mobile, and they're making the necessary         |
| 01:24:54   | changes, but I just wanted to update that, I don't really have a lot to say, except...               |
| 01:24:59   | No, I do actually have a tip for people, though, because one of the things that I've been            |
| 01:25:03   | doing is I've got focus modes, and I wanted to start, I've got a generic podcasting focus            |
| 01:25:09   | mode.                                                                                                |
| 01:25:10   | I wanted to start that automatically when I choose any of my podcast recording setups,               |
| 01:25:17   | and I use Bunch for choosing the podcast recording setups, and I was trying to figure out how        |
| 01:25:21   | to do this, and there are a whole bunch of different options, [[Stephen Millard]], who was               |
| 01:25:25   | on the show before, did a great post on how he's got all the Shortcuts into [[Alfred]], and              |
| 01:25:30   | he's got a workflow that you can download for that, and I'll put a link to that in the               |
| 01:25:34   | show notes.                                                                                          |
| 01:25:35   | But what I ended up doing for this, because I just wanted to be able to add it to the                |
| 01:25:39   | line, a really simple line, to all of my bunches for this, I, in the Shortcuts view,                 |
| 01:25:49   | the grid view, if you click on a Shortcut there, and then you add it to the Dock.                    |
| 01:25:54   | What that does is it actually puts a reference to your Shortcut in your Users Applications           |
| 01:25:59   | folder.                                                                                              |
| 01:26:00   | So not the big Applications folder where everything gets installed, but your Users Applications      |
| 01:26:04   | folder.                                                                                              |
| 01:26:05   | So you can then remove it from the Dock, and then you can still call that, because you've            |
| 01:26:09   | added it to a folder which is then visible everywhere, and of course things like Bunch               |
| 01:26:14   | and so on will happily read that folder to find out what applications have been installed            |
| 01:26:17   | for your specific user.                                                                              |
| 01:26:19   | Interesting.                                                                                         |
| 01:26:20   | So that's what I've been doing with that, and I think, and I know quite a few people                 |
| 01:26:23   | have been asking me, how can I run a Shortcut automatically for various different things?            |
| 01:26:32   | And this is one of the ways that you can do that.                                                    |
| 01:26:35   | There is also another app which recently came out, which basically aims to be the Automation         |
| 01:26:41   | tab for Shortcuts on the Mac.                                                                        |
| 01:26:45   | Because if you look at Shortcuts on iOS and iPadOS, then it's got an Automation tab, but             |
| 01:26:50   | there isn't one on the Mac, and that was something that drove me a little bit crazy, but somebody    |
| 01:26:55   | of course has written their own app, which its entire purpose is to be the Automation                |
| 01:27:02   | tab of Shortcuts on the Mac.                                                                         |
| 01:27:04   | So I both love this, and I think they're going to get Sherlocked next year.                         |
| 01:27:09   | Oh, definitely.                                                                                      |
| 01:27:10   | I think this will be built in.                                                                       |
| 01:27:11   | But at the same time, it is fabulous that somebody out there has done this, and so I'll              |
| 01:27:16   | include a link to that one in the share notes as well.                                               |
| 01:27:19   | Well, I do think that progress is happening here, and it's going to get better, but it's             |
| 01:27:24   | just we're in a very weird space right now.                                                          |
| 01:27:27   | And Rose is trying to update her book, I'm trying to make a field guide, and it's actually           |
| 01:27:30   | quite challenging.                                                                                   |
| 01:27:31   | Yeah, it's one of those things, we do all the work and then things change, which is                  |
| 01:27:35   | to be expected, but once when you've not been able to release the changes that have happened         |
| 01:27:39   | already, it's a little frustrating at times.                                                         |
| 01:27:42   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:27:43   | We'll get there.                                                                                     |
| 01:27:44   | But I think it's getting there.                                                                      |
| 01:27:45   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:27:46   | All right.                                                                                           |
