| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators. My name is Rosemary Orchard, and I'm here as always                   |
| 00:07      | with my fellow co-host, David Sparks. Hey, David, how are you today?                                    |
| 00:10      | Great, Ros, how are you today?                                                                          |
| 00:11      | I am great, because we love talking about automating your technology and how fun it is                  |
| 00:16      | and how nerdy we can get. And so we decided to ask a friend on the show, of course.                     |
| 00:20      | And welcome to the show, [[Alex Cox]].                                                                      |
| 00:23      | Hello. Thank you so much for having me, friends. You are both some of my favourite people                |
| 00:29      | and this is one of my favourite shows that has gotten me through this year. So thank you so much.        |
| 00:35      | That's our goal, is we are here to solve the pandemic with nerdy automation.                            |
| 00:41      | Yes. Yeah, I've got to.                                                                                 |
| 00:43      | Exactly. And actually, Alex, one of the reasons why I wanted to ask you on the show, David,             |
| 00:47      | and I both wanted to get you on the show for different reasons, I think,                                |
| 00:50      | first of all, just because you're a nice person to talk to. But I remembered you telling me             |
| 00:54      | on multiple occasions that you love automating stuff, but you struggle with it sometimes.               |
| 00:57      | And I thought that would be great to talk about, because automation for me came relatively easily,      |
| 01:03      | but it doesn't come easily for everybody. And so it's great to talk to somebody who                     |
| 01:08      | also experiences that from time to time and to see what you still managed to accomplish,                |
| 01:12      | because you have managed great things.                                                                  |
| 01:14      | Oh, totally. I think that's really interesting the way you put that, because you're right. I have been  |
| 01:22      | been automating what seems like, oh gosh, my entire life. I'm 30 now. And my first automation,          |
| 01:30      | I think, technically would be that I set up something just, I think it was just a key                   |
| 01:38      | binding to pull up a fake spreadsheet on macOS 9, which actually became a thing in macOS 10.            |
| 01:46      | So it would look to my parents, like I was doing homework. Yeah, exactly. And I just had my own         |
| 01:55      | homework mode, so that I wish I could say I was doing something cool, but really,                       |
| 02:01      | I was just reading Harry Potter on a pirate open source e-reader or something.                          |
| 02:08      | But it's always been a case for me of, if I do something more than once, I                              |
| 02:14      | just want someone else or a machine to do it for me, because the only limited resource other than       |
| 02:25      | money for me has always been my time and energy. But it's folks like you and David who are so,          |
| 02:33      | so good at this that allows the noobs like me or the people who continue to be noobs despite            |
| 02:44      | doing this for so long, because you share so many of your resources and they're so, so helpful.         |
| 02:51      | Well, I really think that I'm just, I'm about your level, Alex, honestly. Rose is what you're           |
| 02:58      | getting a master's in computer programming. I mean, software engineering, actually.                     |
| 03:05      | So I mean, she's got a few tools at her disposal that I don't, honestly. I muddle my way through        |
| 03:10      | [[JavaScript]] and [[AppleScript]]. [[Xcode]], I've made a couple apps in there, but [[Xcode]] is a thing where        |
| 03:16      | you've got to do it every day to be any good at it, and I have other things to do. But I do think       |
| 03:22      | that people without the formalised education can take massive advantage of this. Number one,            |
| 03:28      | we've got all these cool tools available to us, like the stuff we talk about all the time, shortcuts    |
| 03:33      | and [[Keyboard Maestro]], and all these great tools. But also just, I think the trick to being an           |
| 03:40      | automator isn't being a professional software designer. It is having that radar to say, hey,            |
| 03:48      | here's something I do every day that wastes my time, that my brain is not engaged. I'm just             |
| 03:54      | doing manual work, and I'm on a computer, and computers are really good at doing stuff like             |
| 03:59      | this without humans. And how do I go on the journey of fixing that? And I think that's                  |
| 04:07      | all it really takes. Once you get there, you are an automator. You've already arrived. Now,             |
| 04:12      | it's just a question of how far down the rabbit hole do you go. But I think just having that            |
| 04:18      | awareness is really all it takes. Yeah, someone once said to me, and then I heard it repeated,          |
| 04:25      | I think to [[Myke Hurley]], maybe it was one of you, it's like, sure, you're not a programmer, but          |
| 04:31      | you're an automator, because it's kind of like someone has given me a bunch of Lego and Tinkertoy,      |
| 04:40      | and then Mega Blocks. And so there's all these different tools that don't necessarily                   |
| 04:47      | play together perfectly. But if you build it the right way, you can make some sort of                   |
| 04:53      | machine to help you do your work is kind of how I try to think about it.                                |
| 04:58      | Yeah. And then in this analogy, user interface scripting is literally the duct tape that you            |
| 05:04      | can just basically attach anything. But I agree. And I think that's all you need. If you're             |
| 05:12      | listening to this show and you want to become a better automator, you want to get it at automation,     |
| 05:18      | look at you are already in the very, very, very small percentage of people that are aware of            |
| 05:23      | this problem and the ability to get it out of your life. And what Alex said earlier was absolutely      |
| 05:29      | true. I mean, I always put myself in the shoes of Bill Gates, right? Bill Gates has enough money        |
| 05:34      | to do anything he wants. What he doesn't have is extra time. All the money in the world doesn't         |
| 05:40      | give you 26 hours in the day. You still have 24, and it just comes down to how you use them. And        |
| 05:47      | with automation, you can use a little less of it on menial work. For sure. Okay. That being said,       |
| 05:56      | tell us a little bit. So you said you made a key binding as your first, how did you, I mean,            |
| 06:01      | key binding is your first automation. That's pretty, that's pretty ballsy, man. Well,                   |
| 06:06      | that's the thing is it was because there weren't as many tools that were accessible.                    |
| 06:13      | Well, in goodness, what was this, 2001? And no, who knows, times an illusion. It could be 2020          |
| 06:23      | or 2038 by the time someone's listening to this. But it was shows like Mac power users. And I think     |
| 06:33      | even before that, what was it, Mac OS, Ken or something like that? Yeah. And so every once              |
| 06:41      | in a while, someone would mention just a cool thing that was happening, right? And then I would         |
| 06:47      | do a deep dive of like, okay, how does this actually work? And then after discovering Brett             |
| 06:53      | Terpstra, one day I'll get his name right, discovering his work. And of course, our mutual              |
| 07:00      | friend, Merlin Mann, it was kind of the thing of like, they're okay, there are more blocks to            |
| 07:06      | build with. But also now there's a lot more duct tapes that I can actually see what I'm putting         |
| 07:12      | together. And my main duct tape right now is shortcuts and the app [[Drafts]], which I'm sure               |
| 07:20      | we're going to get into. But so much of the automation I use is literally just a cut in                 |
| 07:27      | paste. And then finding that one, I wouldn't even know the one variable that I need to change to        |
| 07:36      | make it work with my calendar or something like that. Yeah. No, that's totally true. And both of        |
| 07:42      | those tools have a ton of premade content where you don't have to invent the wheel for almost           |
| 07:49      | anything you want to do. Also, when I was 12, I had much more time on my hands. So I could really       |
| 07:56      | take a long time not to figure something out necessarily, but at least make it work.                    |
| 08:02      | Yeah, I was the same way. I mean, I was on an Atari ST computer. Actually, I started on an              |
| 08:08      | Atari 400, which was the worst computer ever made. I'm pretty sure if you're listening to this and      |
| 08:14      | you're old enough, it had a membrane keyboard. It wasn't an actual keyboard. It was a piece of plastic. |
| 08:20      | Oh, wow. You had to just press against it really hard to engage the letter. And then on the one         |
| 08:29      | I had, because it was like a hand me down, it sometimes didn't work. So I'd take a screwdriver          |
| 08:35      | and I'd press the key really hard with the screwdriver and that would do it. But then                   |
| 08:39      | it would sometimes instead of getting one T, it would get like six T's because I pressed                |
| 08:44      | the screwdriver too hard. And then I'd have to hit the delete key, which was also kind of broken.       |
| 08:49      | So it was. So you experienced the butterfly keyboard before the butterfly keyboard was a                |
| 08:53      | thing, David. The butterfly keyboard is beautiful compared to this. But I think that,                   |
| 08:59      | but dealing with that stuff was like, I was doing kind of TextExpander before there was a         |
| 09:04      | TextExpander as a kid because I had a keyboard that barely worked. But it's kind of funny. We all           |
| 09:11      | start in this process when we're kids and we have time and start goofing around with this stuff. But    |
| 09:16      | then as you get older, you really do see the benefits of it. And it really does help you.               |
| 09:20      | And we didn't introduce you properly. I mean, you do video production, you're, you know,                |
| 09:26      | you're on a podcast much more popular than ours, which is just a great podcast, you and Merlin.         |
| 09:34      | And then like, you know, you're a very busy lady and you got a lot of stuff going on in your life.      |
| 09:41      | And I think automation is probably almost necessary for you to keep up with everything.                 |
| 09:47      | Yes, I, you know, it could be argued how sane I am right right now. But the only way I am able to       |
| 09:55      | sort of hold things together, not just hold things together. I'm joking. But really,                    |
| 10:01      | so much of the automation in my life is sort of a way to just ease anxiety and to get through           |
| 10:11      | the decision fatigue just day to day, especially now as, you know, I am in Chicago and we're going      |
| 10:19      | back down into, into like a COVID lock down. And having systems in place where I just                    |
| 10:27      | don't need to think is so, so great. I mean, gosh, I am preaching to the choir,                         |
| 10:33      | to the folks who are listening to this. But I actually would like to encourage folks to                 |
| 10:39      | kind of look at all of their systems they have in place now, which I think in like our [[Apple]]            |
| 10:45      | communities, everyone kind of is doing, especially with like note taking. But I mean, we're in a        |
| 10:52      | different worlds right now. And I think every time there's a big milestone in your life,                |
| 10:57      | whether it's moving or having kids or spending your entire time in your apartment, being able           |
| 11:04      | to kind of rip off the duct tape and look at the structures you have in place and see if anything       |
| 11:10      | is hindering you rather than helping you is also really important because that's where I often get      |
| 11:17      | stuck in automation is when I've just used something for so long that I don't even know how it works    |
| 11:24      | anymore. So it's like, okay, I'm going to just keep on using this. It's fine. It's fine. But then       |
| 11:31      | eventually it ends up being like, all right, me writing down my to-do list is way easier than,          |
| 11:38      | you know, transferring this [[JavaScript]] automation into the new version of OmniFocus. And I don't        |
| 11:47      | know if it's the beta or if it's me or you know what, I'm just going to write it down. Stuff like       |
| 11:52      | that. No, it can become a rabbit hole of its own. Lately, I've been really interested in what I         |
| 11:59      | call contextual computing, where, you know, you use a combination of automation and smarts to           |
| 12:05      | to jump from an idea in your head like I want to write a document or whatever to actually writing       |
| 12:13      | the document and removing all those intermittent steps in the middle of finding the app, creating       |
| 12:18      | the file, doing all that. And automation helps with that. And the more I look into it, there's          |
| 12:23      | actually a school of science called cognitive computing. We had a guy on Mac Power. He's just           |
| 12:28      | looked at one recently to talk about it. This is the cognitive overload that we all face. And I         |
| 12:36      | think in a time of crisis like now, I mean, a lot of us are dealing with, you know, do we have jobs?    |
| 12:42      | You know, there's all these things worried, you know, am I going to get sick? And I feel like           |
| 12:49      | I know this sounds dramatic, but I feel like getting this stuff under control in your life,             |
| 12:54      | at least giving you some bit of control somewhere, it helps.                                            |
| 12:58      | Mm-hmm. For sure. And I know this is the less hippie-dippy podcast as you would say, David,             |
| 13:06      | but for automation, that's kind of been my, I don't want to say religion. That's weird. I don't know.   |
| 13:14      | I like how you put it, contextual computing. I've been sort of thinking of something similar as         |
| 13:25      | ambient computing, because, you know, more and more, we're just shouting things                         |
| 13:29      | into the air, in my case, to my beloved Siri ball and soon my mini Siri ball. And I don't know,           |
| 13:39      | it's one of those things of almost a GTD like system where I just want to get all of these              |
| 13:47      | things out of my head, so that either a computer can deal with it right now, or a computer can put      |
| 13:52      | it into a place where I can deal with it later. And I think that's what sort of, I mean, I don't        |
| 13:59      | want to be a downer, because automation really is, when I say it's what keeps me up at night,           |
| 14:05      | I mean that in the best way. It's that thing where it's this tiny little problem that you can solve     |
| 14:10      | just makes you feel more control and empowered, really. And it's kind of like a hobby too, I think,     |
| 14:17      | for all of us. It's like, here's a little puzzle. It's a jigsaw puzzle on a computer. It's like,        |
| 14:24      | how can I make the computer do this for me next time, so I don't have to do it again? And that's        |
| 14:28      | always fun to solve. I think that's what gets Rose going, right? I mean, I can't get over some of the   |
| 14:35      | cool automations Rose comes up with, and I'm sure it all starts out with, how can I, you know,          |
| 14:39      | what's a way I could solve this problem? Well, I mean, I also get myself into trouble with that.        |
| 14:44      | I recently discovered my laptop wasn't charging on my sofa. And then I realised that the automation     |
| 14:48      | had set up to turn off the heater in my living room, which is connected to a smart plug, was            |
| 14:53      | working perfectly. Only I plug the heater into the wall and the extension lead into the smart           |
| 14:58      | outlet. So, you know, everybody can get themselves into trouble with this. It was a basic               |
| 15:06      | case of I plugged everything in. I just didn't plug everything in right. But you know, I got there      |
| 15:10      | and now I have some super fancy going to bed automations, which work perfectly and my laptop            |
| 15:15      | still gets charged overnight. So I'm gonna tease that. That's a future show for us because Rose got     |
| 15:19      | her own place and she keeps sending me pictures of home automation gear. And we are going to pull       |
| 15:25      | that apart. Maybe in the next episode, I don't know, but soon I got to get the story on this house.     |
| 15:32      | It's good, David. Opening a window turns off the heater and stuff like that. So,                        |
| 15:36      | you know, like energy efficiency is involved the whole lot. It's great fun.                             |
| 15:40      | It's going to be like Wonka like magic at the door cretins.                                             |
| 15:45      | Rose, I think you and I are kind of right now living David's dream because I know that                  |
| 15:52      | you moved house every time you say it. And I also, I don't live alone, but my spouse is very            |
| 16:01      | patient with all of the nonsense that I put into place in my apartment. And I am kind of watching       |
| 16:10      | what you're doing and like, okay, how do I do what Rose is doing but not set things on fire?            |
| 16:15      | Because, you know, Christmas is coming up and I will be in my apartment during Christmas and oh,        |
| 16:21      | wow, the automations, just the useless, but beautiful light automations that are going on               |
| 16:26      | right now. I love it. And like the seriously, Rose, you have inspired me in your work in terms of like  |
| 16:35      | your jobby job, how you use automations there. I mean, you basically, I also have a similar job         |
| 16:43      | where a lot of it is like, quote, knowledge work, but I have to interact with humans,                   |
| 16:47      | which really gets in the way of my day. But when I can convince my bosses to pay me to solve an         |
| 16:55      | automation puzzle, I'm like, yeah, that's nice. All right, cool. Yeah, I've been doing that             |
| 17:00      | literally at work this week. There's a little automation puzzle that's come up and somebody             |
| 17:05      | said, can you just move this from here to here? And I was like, can I resell the problem please?        |
| 17:09      | Because the way it's solved is not very efficient. And I would like it to be more efficient and         |
| 17:12      | easier to maintain that that's the key words. If you can put the words easier to maintain               |
| 17:17      | in there, then you can sell it nothing to anybody pretty much. Yes, yep, agreed. Yep.                   |
| 17:23      | Yes. And well, I haven't set my house on fire yet. But your spouse will be very pleased to know         |
| 17:28      | that there are lots of very spouse friendly automations that I've built into things because             |
| 17:33      | my parents have been popping over and helping out with things. And I've wanted things to                |
| 17:36      | work for people other than myself. So I've had to build everything with that in mind.                   |
| 17:40      | Alex, can you replace the switches in your place? I mean, I don't know if you're in an                  |
| 17:45      | apartment or a house or whatever, but do you have the ability to change out the wall switches?          |
| 17:51      | No, and I know that you're a neutron guy, but unfortunately,                                            |
| 17:56      | someone who has other humans in his life. That was the game changer for us like replacing the           |
| 18:02      | wall switch because when I had them on the Phillips Hue bulbs, everybody universally in                 |
| 18:08      | my house hated me because they would turn on the switch and the light would not go on.                  |
| 18:13      | And then I was angry because they'd turn off the switch and none of my automations would work. So       |
| 18:19      | being able to do the switches was a big change. I guess you can get the magnetic plates and put         |
| 18:25      | them over the top of them and then put. Yeah, that's what I've done in my place. I could have           |
| 18:29      | gone with the smart switches, but over here we don't have neutrons. We've got Lightwave and             |
| 18:35      | the hub for that is 125 pounds. And then each light switch is another 55 pounds.                        |
| 18:41      | So you're looking at hundreds of pounds just to replace single light switches. And in places            |
| 18:48      | like the kitchen here, you need to have a qualified electrician come in and do stuff because water      |
| 18:52      | and electricity together could be considered a bad idea. So understandably, building regulations        |
| 18:56      | require that you have somebody who actually knows what they're doing and play with that stuff.          |
| 19:00      | So I've got a switch bot in my kitchen, which will press the light switch for me because I just         |
| 19:04      | stuck it on top of the light switch. And it literally physically presses the switch. It's               |
| 19:07      | got a little arm that comes out and go. I've got one of those on the way to turn on my like             |
| 19:15      | espresso machine as well as one of my lamps that well, it's like a it's another Christmas light         |
| 19:22      | thing where I have a smart switch to turn it on. But you have to hit the button to turn the lights      |
| 19:29      | on. And I'm like, oh, I tried duct tape duct taping is a part of my software, like my                   |
| 19:37      | automation life as well as my literal, you know, smart home life in that I could put fancy things       |
| 19:43      | over my light switches. Swipe. Wow, light switches. But I just have duct tape over them. It looks fine. |
| 19:50      | I've been using masking tape to test sensor placement. So I get exactly what you're talking             |
| 19:55      | about. Absolutely. Okay, how had I never heard of switch bot before? Well, the problem with             |
| 20:01      | switch bot, David, is it doesn't have home kit support. But if you buy the hub, which is it's           |
| 20:06      | a cute little cloud shape with rainbow lights in it, it's so pretty. And if you buy that, then it has   |
| 20:12      | shortcut support. So then you can either do something using push cut automation server,                 |
| 20:17      | or you can use Homebridge, which is what I am playing with right now to to get that in. So my          |
| 20:22      | kitchen light is officially in there. It's it was on Kickstarter, they even have like a curtain         |
| 20:27      | track thing. But unfortunately, that looks like it's not available yet in Europe, which is a shame,     |
| 20:31      | because I would like to automate my curtains, but I was not interested in buying the specific curtain   |
| 20:36      | rails and everything from [[Aqara]], or Xiaomi, which, yeah, sell all of that stuff. But it's              |
| 20:44      | good fun. And home automation is definitely something that I have been spending a reasonable            |
| 20:50      | amount of time with. Let's put it that way. This episode of The Automators is brought to you by         |

| 22:52      | automators. Our thanks to PDFpen from Smile for their support of this show and relay FM.                |
| 22:58      | Alex, earlier you said a word that piqued my interest, and that's, of course, [[Drafts]].                   |
| 23:06      | You're doing automation and [[Drafts]]. Tell us what you're doing.                                          |
| 23:10      | I don't want to say everything because that makes it sound like I'm competent.                          |
| 23:17      | [[Drafts]] is, if folks don't know, which I can't imagine if you've listened to the show,                   |
| 23:21      | it's sold as where text starts. It's an app for iOS and macOS, but for me, it's almost                  |
| 23:32      | like its own tiny little operating system. [[Drafts]] is where text absolutely starts for me                |
| 23:42      | everywhere and anywhere. Where I do work and meeting notes or show notes for podcasts or                |
| 23:50      | perhaps writing the manual for my home, which I do indeed have for when people used to have to          |
| 23:58      | house it. It's also the place where my brain starts. That used to be what OmniFocus was for             |
| 24:09      | me, and I still adore OmniFocus. Everything and anything I put into [[Drafts]], I can put into              |
| 24:16      | somewhere else because of the wonderful [[Drafts]], what's it called? The [[Drafts]] action directory,          |
| 24:23      | which has a bajillion, I believe is the correct number, of things that have been put there,             |
| 24:32      | actions that have been put there by users, so that there's something that can change                    |
| 24:38      | something, not just into markdown, but a specific weird form of markdown and                            |
| 24:42      | turn everything from a Taskpaper template to an OmniFocus template. Gosh, I'm just opening my          |
| 24:52      | different groups and workspaces on my Mac right now. One of my favourites is from your own Rosemary      |
| 25:00      | Orchards, the packing list that you did on your traveling episode. It's a lifesaver. Right now,         |
| 25:09      | actually, I just started playing with this group of actions and workspace called ThoughtAsylum,        |
| 25:17      | which I kind of enjoy because that's sort of how my brain feels at some points.                         |
| 25:24      | It's kind of an app within [[Drafts]]. It's hard for me to explain, and I'll get the link for               |
| 25:34      | show notes, but it's sort of like, all right, we're going to remove another level of your thinking      |
| 25:41      | so that you can do all of that within [[Drafts]]. Yeah, ThoughtAsylum also, they have this suite           |
| 25:48      | for [[Drafts]] that they introduced in, I believe, at the end of September, but they also have              |
| 25:55      | a ton of shortcuts if you want to make the most of your experiences on mobile as well.                  |
| 26:04      | That's kind of what I am looking for is something that will work both always on my Mac and always       |
| 26:12      | on my iOS devices, and maybe [[Apple Silicon]] will make that easier. But right now, [[Drafts]] is kind         |
| 26:21      | of the only thing that I can rely on to be on both operating systems and work the way I want it to.     |
| 26:31      | Yeah, I mean, getting [[Drafts]] on both the Mac and iOS and iPad and having all that automation            |
| 26:38      | transfer over the way Greg did it makes the app, it's like one of these things like 1 plus 1 equals     |
| 26:44      | like 12 because it's just so much more useful when you're switching between platforms and all           |
| 26:50      | that stuff just comes along for the ride. And I totally get what you mean for [[Drafts]] like               |
| 26:56      | as an automation platform. And we never really, I don't know if we ever really acknowledged that        |
| 27:01      | in the show because we talk about shortcuts, we talk about [[Keyboard Maestro]] and [[Hazel]] and all            |
| 27:05      | these after [[Drafts]] itself as a platform for automation. Recently, I've been playing a lot               |
| 27:11      | with backlinks and using some of this software. And there's a whole action group in [[Drafts]] for          |
| 27:16      | backlinks that it's already there. I mean, if you just add double brackets around things in [[Drafts]],     |
| 27:21      | you'll be able to see everything that links to your current draft with an action group that             |
| 27:26      | somebody already created. I mean, I texted Greg the developer draft saying you should add backlink      |
| 27:34      | support. And he's like, it's already there. Somebody else already did it. And I'm like, okay.           |
| 27:38      | Another app I really like there had it. And I also texted Greg and I'm like, hey,                       |
| 27:45      | I'm trying to get on the train of trying new ways of taking notes like Zettelkasten a fancy              |
| 27:54      | German word and Roam and all that stuff. And really, I can try all of that out in [[Drafts]] now.           |
| 28:01      | And I still don't exactly know how backlinks work. I just know that I put links in,                     |
| 28:07      | put those brackets in, and then suddenly I have this directory of notes and I've built my own           |
| 28:12      | wiki, which is wild. Like baby me trying to build wikis. Oh, so hard in like 2001 when you had no       |
| 28:22      | programming experience. And now it is, you do a couple clicks and you have a wiki for your cats.        |
| 28:30      | It's great. So what are some of the automations that you use in [[Drafts]]? What are some of your           |
| 28:37      | actions? My favourite, honestly, is just changing my show notes from markdown to like a few small        |
| 28:49      | adjustments to get them into simple cast, which is one of the web apps I use for hosting podcasts.      |
| 28:59      | Because there's one thing like a dash means something different. It's not multi markdown.               |
| 29:09      | It's very weird. It's not that I would say don't use it, but don't. It's very difficult to use          |
| 29:16      | lip syn or something else. And also, just automatically, there's an action that moves                   |
| 29:24      | everything that hasn't been, this is a super simple one, but one that is just wonderful,                |
| 29:30      | moves everything from the past week that hasn't been tagged, flagged, or put into,                      |
| 29:39      | oh yeah, just tagged or flagged, that's still in the inbox and archives it. Because I, you know,        |
| 29:46      | you know, [[Drafts]] is my inbox now, unlike OmniFocus. And it also works sort of in conjunction            |
| 29:58      | with shortcuts in [[Day One]], in that I have a number of templates for, and I actually don't               |
| 30:05      | know how this works, but I have a template that sends something to [[Day One]], and it might involve        |
| 30:11      | Zapier in that, but I'm not sure. Because again, there's duct tape over it, but I don't really          |
| 30:19      | know what's going on underneath there. I think your, this was built after you did the Automator's       |
| 30:26      | episode about journalling, because that's another thing that I was never able to get into until          |
| 30:33      | something basically could journal for me. I could vomit the thoughts, and then it would do its thing,   |
| 30:40      | like put the dates out, and all I need to do is jot down a thought, tag it, and then it is all          |
| 30:47      | pretty when I go and go back to, like, look through my [[Day One]] journal throughout the year,             |
| 30:53      | and like, ah, this actually makes sense. Yeah, I'm guessing if you're doing it over the web,            |
| 30:58      | it's IFTTT, because they have really good integration with [[Day One]], and so there's a single             |
| 31:04      | action. But also, [[Day One]] has a [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]], so an easy way to, because I'd use some draft               |
| 31:11      | entries via [[Day One]], and I don't send them to the internet, I just use their [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]],                |
| 31:16      | and it just, you know, drops it right in. It even puts it in the appropriate journal,                   |
| 31:22      | because I have like 10 of them. I have too many journals, but so I have a draft where it takes          |
| 31:27      | the draft text and runs a [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] to send it into [[Day One]]. Yeah, I'd be curious. Keep writing        |
| 31:34      | that down. Yeah, well, it's, I'll send it to you. I'll put it in the show notes. I'll tell you,         |
| 31:38      | I'll, maybe I'll do a post on it or something, but the, it's not, it's not that hard to use it,         |
| 31:45      | but it is a much better platform to get quick text and then send it there. But I want to wind           |
| 31:51      | back a little bit. So the first one that you talked about was, it sounded like a text modification      |
| 31:57      | script. You've got text and you're changing it. What, how is it, you know, because we're Automators,    |
| 32:02      | we've got to know what, how are you doing that? What's the action doing? It finds all the stars         |
| 32:09      | and brackets. It is essentially a find and replace. And, you know, how the, the one like                |
| 32:18      | forever bug in markdown, where if you do a Wikipedia link, where anything is parenthesised,             |
| 32:24      | it's just, sometimes it'll work. Sometimes it doesn't. It looks for those two and                       |
| 32:30      | also anything that in the, like, the markdown links, if it's, it finds [[Amazon]] colon space               |
| 32:41      | and just gets rid of that. And then in order to send, how I'm opening [[Drafts]] right now to               |
| 32:48      | figure out how I send it to simple cast. Oh yeah, that just ends up being a Zapier automation,          |
| 32:56      | actually, to get it into simple cast. It creates, it's, it creates a draft of an episode. And then      |
| 33:05      | Merlin Mann goes in there and uploads an episode, which I wish we could automate that. We've been        |
| 33:10      | trying for, for so long. And, but you can, I finally found out, or I found a good shortcut,             |
| 33:19      | as in iOS shortcut, to upload an episode to overcast to listen to it, but haven't found a way           |
| 33:27      | to automate an upload of an episode to simple cast without having to go into the web interface          |
| 33:36      | and poke some buttons, which I'm not a fan of clicking buttons anymore. Yeah, well, I just              |
| 33:42      | want to just take a minute though to acknowledge this first thing you did though with the text          |
| 33:47      | modification, because I think that's something a lot of people run into all the time. And it's          |
| 33:52      | not necessarily the parentheses and the wiki link that you're dealing with, but everybody has this      |
| 33:58      | thing where you write text and something has to change, or you have like, you routinely import          |
| 34:04      | text, like a lot of times you bring text in from a spreadsheet or a website, and you've got to make     |
| 34:10      | these changes to it. And there are apps out there like [[TextSoap]] that can help you. But if it's a        |
| 34:16      | very particular kind of modification, doing it in [[Drafts]] makes a lot of sense. And I'm guessing         |
| 34:23      | it took you a while to kind of tune that to get exactly what you wanted in terms of removing            |
| 34:28      | parentheses and removing the [[Amazon]] colon. It didn't work the first time, right? Yeah, I mean,          |
| 34:34      | actually now it only breaks. And by break, I mean, I have to just go in and adjust one or two           |
| 34:42      | links or something like that every like three months or so. But I'd say it took like a couple           |
| 34:48      | weeks of tuning it exactly to like our show notes needs. And I actually have another action for         |
| 34:56      | different show notes, not for posting, just for formatting them in the way that my co-host and          |
| 35:01      | I like. And yeah, I mean, that's totally taken from like, I guess the reverse, I tried to like          |
| 35:09      | reverse TextExpander it. And [[Drafts]], I mean, [[Drafts]] just having such a simple way to reorganise        |
| 35:17      | blocks of text is, I mean, I know it's not really automation, but trying to do that in another,         |
| 35:24      | any other app is just, you know, 20 minutes of Googling until you can figure it out that is             |
| 35:33      | buried in some setting. I mean, any, I think the more visible in automation is initially the            |
| 35:42      | smaller the barrier to entry is, because once you figure out, you can do one thing, it's like,          |
| 35:47      | oh, my, my, my. Well, if I can make this easier, how can I shave off another 20 minutes of show         |
| 35:54      | note prep or something like that? Yeah, I feel like the gateway drive for [[Drafts]] for a lot of           |
| 35:59      | people if you're listening, you haven't used it is the insert text action. So if you have anything      |
| 36:06      | you do, let's say you go to a meeting every Monday and you want to just open a draft and have it put    |
| 36:13      | all the template in for your meeting. You just do that once and you save it as an insert text           |
| 36:18      | action. And you can download any of many from the [[Drafts]] action directory, or this is when you          |
| 36:23      | create yourself. And then once you've created it, that's all you do. There's no magic [[JavaScript]]        |
| 36:29      | programming going on. It's just dropping text into your draft for you. So you can have a starting       |
| 36:34      | point, you know, you can have like going to the meeting example, because I have one like that,          |
| 36:38      | that puts the date and time, it puts the people who are in attendance, because it's always the same     |
| 36:43      | people from my meetings. At the bottom, it has an action list. And you can just like go in and          |
| 36:49      | just set the template around it and anybody can do this. Anybody listening to this is so easy.          |
| 36:54      | And then once you have that one, then suddenly you have an excuse to make so many more like I've        |
| 37:00      | been playing a lot lately with this Mac app called [[Obsidian]], which is kind of like, you know,           |
| 37:04      | getting to that Zettelkasten thing. It's a kind of app that really focuses on that,                   |
| 37:09      | but they don't have an iOS app. So I took all, but it works in markdown. So I took all my templates     |
| 37:15      | out of the [[Obsidian]] and added them to [[Drafts]] as an action list, where it's just insert text. So I       |
| 37:21      | can write anything for [[Obsidian]] on my iPhone using [[Drafts]]. And like, there's so many uses for this      |
| 37:27      | stuff. And that's the most basic easy automation. I mean, what you just said blew my mind, because      |
| 37:34      | my one thing about not trying [[Obsidian]] was the fact that it wasn't on iOS. Because when you get         |
| 37:44      | down to it, my phone is truly my main computer, actually. So, but I think I'm getting more out          |
| 37:53      | of this episode than anybody else right now. Well, if you want to go down that rabbit hole,             |
| 37:59      | [[Obsidian]] is just markdown files. So you put it on [[Dropbox]]. And if you have one,                         |
| 38:03      | why didn't put that together? Like, that's awesome. Oh, of course. Oh, I hope that this team gets,      |
| 38:08      | oh, I wish I could give them money. Can I give them money, David? Oh, good. If you give them money,     |
| 38:15      | you get into the insider build. So you get ahead of the, you know, the rest of the proletariat.         |
| 38:20      | It's very exciting. Maybe I get to bug the developer. Yeah, very small team. So they like               |
| 38:28      | being bugged. But I guess to go down that rabbit hole, I put it on [[Dropbox]] and I can actually           |
| 38:34      | access the whole database with one writer on an iPhone or iPad. But I actually create all the           |
| 38:40      | notes and [[Drafts]] because [[Drafts]] has this great, you know, plugin style automation.                      |
| 38:47      | So anything I'm writing new, I write in draft. If I need to access an existing one, I just go to        |
| 38:51      | one writer. But that's not why we're here today. You got any more [[Drafts]], magic you can share with us?  |
| 38:58      | What? I mean, they're all very boring and you have sort of made all of them. Yeah, you can find         |
| 39:07      | them all in the automated show notes. No, actually, the one thing I actually just realised is I         |
| 39:17      | share a bunch of meeting note templates with folks and they download [[Drafts]]. Oh, this free              |
| 39:24      | application. And they share it. I just share this with them. And then they actually, you know, we       |
| 39:29      | now have universal meeting notes that look the same in Google Docs every time. And I'm like,            |
| 39:34      | oh, my gosh. Yeah, it's been amazing. I also have, you know, really simple, like single action          |
| 39:42      | action items, like searching for, or I have a group of just different search engines,                   |
| 39:50      | a Wolfram Alpha, [[DuckDuckGo]], Google and a whole bunch of stuff that I actually should ask you if        |
| 39:59      | there's an action to, I think there's a shortcut to turn on your VPN. But what I would love is if       |
| 40:06      | there was an action to turn on a VPN before I go into Google or some other search engine that I         |
| 40:13      | don't know is secure, but I need to use, that's one of the things I love. Something that I don't        |
| 40:20      | use personally, but for other work social media accounts is the tweet storm action, which kind          |
| 40:29      | of just formats your tweets in a way that you, you know, how they're like the tweet thread is           |
| 40:37      | going to be seen. And these are all like the most basic, like this is what I use every single day.      |
| 40:46      | And then the thing that got me hooked on [[Drafts]] actually was, I think when that is now pre-installed,   |
| 40:54      | the, that just is marked, it's just a straight up markdown keyboard. And then it also is an             |
| 41:02      | action to see your stats. So, and by stats, I just mean, you know, like the word count, paragraph       |
| 41:10      | count, stuff like that. And it has a way to, instead of saying like, oh, and insert a dash,             |
| 41:19      | bracket, bracket, it's just tasks. So then suddenly I have this great markdown or test paper            |
| 41:27      | list that I can do anything with or, you know, put it into [[Obsidian]], which I have now downloaded        |
| 41:35      | and I'm super psyched to try. And even things like send to bear, the, oh, send to [[Dropbox]] with          |
| 41:46      | link, which I think Rose, you made this for me. It's just a, it's in one of my workspaces in [[Drafts]].    |
| 41:55      | I have a bunch of images that I need to reference all the time for work, but they need to live in       |
| 42:02      | [[Dropbox]] and it's so much easier to hand my phone to somebody with a list of, just a list of images      |
| 42:14      | basically. And then they click that one and then it opens the [[Drafts]] app with the exact image that      |
| 42:20      | they need to look at. So it doesn't require them, you know, scrolling through my photo library or       |
| 42:26      | getting immediately to the right folder in [[Drafts]] because we all know how fun the draft, or I'm         |
| 42:31      | sorry, all how fun the [[Dropbox]] app is on iOS. And it's, oh yeah, I don't know, which that's not         |
| 42:40      | one I've been using lately, but it, it's like a lifesaver at events, because I well did often           |
| 42:47      | work in live events and, you know, having your entire like work and life reference library in           |
| 42:55      | a single app and being able to manipulate it has, it's just one of those things that relieves           |
| 43:01      | a tiny grain of sand from my life. And the more grains that you take away, it's,                        |
| 43:07      | it's just gets better and better. And then there's a whole, I have a workspace called                   |
| 43:15      | rejected tweets that with a certain number of tags, it like won't let me, how did I even do             |
| 43:24      | this? Basically, if it has a certain tag, it goes into a, it goes into my archive where,                |
| 43:31      | and if I open it, the action to tweet, it has gone like in the, you know, the basic                     |
| 43:38      | app actions I have tweet with the Twitter app tweet with tweet bot. But that one does not               |
| 43:44      | allow me to tweet if it has too many swear words or something that will get me in trouble.              |
| 43:49      | So you've basically built your own personal filtering system. So instead of having to have              |
| 43:53      | somebody sit there and go, don't do that. It does it for you. I can think of some other people who      |
| 43:58      | might need this. I know people who do something similar in [[Day One]] where they just have a,              |
| 44:03      | like one of their journals is just called fake Twitter. And I'm like, I should probably                 |
| 44:09      | do that and just put all of my bad, one of my tags is bad takes. And that just goes away and            |
| 44:16      | is deleted after a week. Yeah. As a lawyer, occasionally, some other lawyer will do some                |
| 44:22      | numbskull thing and I get angry. And I always write emails in [[Drafts]] and I'll read the draft.          |
| 44:27      | I'm like, you know what? I'm just going to sleep on this one before I send this one off to email.       |
| 44:32      | And quite often I wake up the next day, I'm like, oh, I need to rewrite this. This is not,              |
| 44:36      | this is not me. This is a crazy person. One of the things about [[Drafts]] that I would,                    |
| 44:43      | and it's not on the developer, it's really on [[Apple]], but, you know, because we're talking about         |
| 44:47      | all these text things we make, like I, like Alex, I open [[Drafts]] constantly. Every time I have a         |
| 44:53      | phone call of any substance with a client, I take notes and [[Drafts]] and I save all these little          |
| 44:57      | markdown files. So I've got records. And the problem is you have two choices. You either save           |
| 45:03      | it to [[Dropbox]] and [[Dropbox]] is its own kind of like hive of villainy, right? But you also,                |
| 45:10      | or you can save it to iCloud. But iCloud only will save it to the [[Drafts]] folder, right? Because of      |
| 45:17      | the iCloud system, they won't let you save outside of the app folder. And I guess this is a security    |
| 45:22      | measure that [[Apple]] has. But man, it makes me crazy. And I've got all these [[Hazel]] rules back on my       |
| 45:27      | Mac that do nothing all day, but sort out iCloud folders and move files for me. And I don't really      |
| 45:34      | know what the answer to it is. I guess if you, you could just use [[Dropbox]] and then you would have more  |
| 45:39      | granular access or you have to deal with this second step. How do you deal with that, Rose?             |
| 45:45      | Well, I pretty much just throw things in [[Dropbox]] because I ended up paying for [[Dropbox]] anyway,          |
| 45:49      | because we use it to share podcasting stuff backwards and forwards. And I use it with Scotty            |
| 45:55      | at nested folders and a bunch of other people. And I thought, you know what, I'm just going to go all   |
| 45:59      | in on [[Dropbox]]. So I paid and I've got the plan and I was like, you know what, I'm just going to use     |
| 46:04      | this. That said, I recently got two home security cameras because there was a noise while I was         |
| 46:10      | podcasting and I couldn't easily check it out. And I was like, if I had cameras, I could check          |
| 46:14      | this out while I was podcasting without getting up and moving. So that was a good idea. But I           |
| 46:18      | now have two terabytes of iCloud storage space as well as two terabytes of [[Dropbox]] space. So I          |
| 46:24      | may need to rethink that plan. That said, I don't think [[Dropbox]] do a smaller tier. So, you know,        |
| 46:29      | I'll see what happens there. But, you know, I pretty much just put things in [[Dropbox]] because            |
| 46:34      | it's easier. And also [[Dropbox]] is available to Zapier and [[Make\|Integromat]]. And honestly, iCloud Drive         |
| 46:41      | is great, but it's not available to either of those services. So that means I can't automatically       |
| 46:45      | have stuff saved into it from online services, which are doing things like creating documents for me    |
| 46:50      | or folders for stuff and things like that. So I pretty much just decided that I'm in on [[Dropbox]].        |
| 46:56      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by the Intrazone by Microsoft SharePoint.                  |
| 47:01      | I love finding new podcasts to listen to. It's great finding those wonderful new co-hosts and           |
| 47:05      | people being interviewed. And that lays you down a whole rabbit hole of even more great new podcasts    |
| 47:10      | to listen to. If you're looking for a new show to listen to, the Intrazone is a bi-weekly podcast       |
| 47:16      | with conversations and interviews on how Microsoft SharePoint, OneDrive, and related tech can work      |
| 47:20      | for you. You'll hear from guest experts behind the scenes and out in the field. So you can see          |
| 47:25      | how SharePoint fits into our everyday work life and easily share and manage content, knowledge,         |
| 47:31      | and applications with these tools. Each show covers a bunch of segments like news and announcements,    |
| 47:38      | a focused topic of the week, guest perspective, FAQs of the week, and upcoming events. And just         |
| 47:43      | so you have an idea of what to expect, I want to tell you about some of the topics you might be         |
| 47:48      | interested in that were on previous episodes. They've discussed working from home, which I know is      |
| 47:53      | relevant to quite a few of our listeners, also figuring out an intelligent intranet in your             |
| 47:58      | organisation. Oh, and they did an episode on talking about APIs and teamwork too, which you should      |
| 48:03      | give a try. I recently listened to the Makers Make Magic episode, and it was really interesting         |
| 48:08      | finding out how these people use lists and data storage, and gave me quite a few ideas of how           |
| 48:14      | I can use that in my own personal automations. Go and listen to it now. Just search for the Intrazone   |
| 48:21      | wherever you get your podcasts. That's I-N-T-R-A-Z-O-N-E, or just click the link in the show notes.     |
| 48:29      | Go check it out. Our thanks to the Intrazone by Microsoft SharePoint for their support of this          |
| 48:33      | show and all of Relay FM. Okay, Alex. So we've talked about [[Drafts]], but you mentioned one of my         |
| 48:40      | other key loves, which is shortcuts. How are you using shortcuts? How many shortcuts do you have?       |
| 48:44      | Let's start with that one. Oh, I really pruned. Right now I have 194, and which I know is like          |
| 48:53      | nothing. Well, I shouldn't say it's like nothing, but recently I made the mistake of updating           |
| 49:01      | my new phone, my lovely iPhone 12, with the sides that are squared off instead of being a soap phone    |
| 49:11      | without realising that my old phone was already on the developer iOS 14.2 beta. So I lost a large       |
| 49:19      | number of shortcuts, and I was like, you know what, let me just do this kind of the way people set up   |
| 49:25      | a new computer or a new, any new device and add them as I need them, because I had all my,              |
| 49:32      | one of my favourite shortcuts is one to back up all of my shortcuts. And wow, like the amount that I     |
| 49:46      | need is pretty small, but then it becomes staggering when I look at all of my folders,                  |
| 49:50      | which I mean, I never really had a need for folders until the new widget came to iOS 14.                |
| 49:59      | So being able to run shortcuts from my home screen has been absolutely wild. So the thing that          |
| 50:08      | really got me into shortcuts was health stuff, actually, once [[Apple]] acquired                            |
| 50:13      | shortcuts, you know, formally workflow, because I never wanted to get into it because I really          |
| 50:21      | thought, oh, there's no way [[Apple]] is going to continue to allow this. Like there's no way [[Apple]]         |
| 50:27      | is going to continue to let me log all of my health data and stuff that, you know, [[Apple]] thinks that    |
| 50:36      | it's data that they shouldn't have, but it's data that I want to have. But now, you know,               |
| 50:42      | I have a widget just completely dedicated to health stuff. And a lot of it is really, again,            |
| 50:49      | easy, simple, single actions, like working with one of my favourite apps, WaterMinder,                   |
| 50:55      | which keeps me incredibly, incredibly high, hydrated throughout the day. So I just have                 |
| 51:00      | little buttons that I hit each time I have finished a glass of water, or in today's case,               |
| 51:07      | three cans of Red Bull. And there's another one that I will definitely get for show notes,              |
| 51:21      | and it's a COVID tracking shortcut, which is not, it's not depressing, actually. The data               |
| 51:28      | that it provides brings me a lot of comfort, as well as I use an app as a zero for fasting. And I       |
| 51:37      | just realised, as I'm talking about this, that so many of the shortcuts I've built myself are           |
| 51:43      | single actions from apps that developers have made. Obviously, what ghosts made instead of              |
| 51:50      | developers, what I mean is, I used to have all of these time tracking shortcuts that were built         |
| 51:59      | from, I think, Zapier actions with toggle. And then eventually, I'm like, okay, this is really          |
| 52:07      | expensive to time out how long I'm doing a podcast recording, because Zapier is like,                   |
| 52:12      | absolutely worth it if you're using it, but I was using it for a single thing.                          |
| 52:16      | But now, the time tracking app I use, Timery, has not only created their own widget, but it has a       |
| 52:25      | bunch of shortcuts that just I can create to stop and start timers so that I don't even need to open    |
| 52:31      | the app. And what I feel like I used to use shortcuts for was to not fight against apps,                |
| 52:39      | but replace something that an app couldn't do, whereas now it feels very much in tandem.                |
| 52:45      | Where that kind of, there are still some things that are a bit hobbled together and don't really        |
| 52:54      | use apps like the thing that the shortcut I use to upload to overcast, I have no idea how it works.     |
| 53:03      | And I also don't know who made it. So if this thing breaks, I am going to be bothering you,             |
| 53:10      | I'm going to be bothering, you know, [[Matthew Cassinelli]], Viticci, anyone who's ever done an              |
| 53:15      | advanced shortcut, like please use this thing, help me fix this thing I use every day. Honestly,        |
| 53:23      | the shortcut I'm most proud of making was a calculate tip, which I know there are many                  |
| 53:32      | templates for this, but I'm like, okay, if I am going to sort of understand variables and understand    |
| 53:39      | how numbers work in the shortcuts app, at least let me do this. So something that I'm sure took         |
| 53:46      | rows, would take rows like 30 seconds to build, took me a couple hours, but I learned so much           |
| 53:53      | about how the app works. And more importantly, what breaks shortcuts. And man, especially with,         |
| 54:03      | I think iOS 14, so much more is visible. And with the new gallery that they have,                       |
| 54:13      | and even in the, have either of you used the tips app in iOS? Yes, yes, I have.                         |
| 54:22      | It's also an app that I use for about a day and then uninstall every time that there's                  |
| 54:26      | a new iOS version out because it starts to annoy me, but I can see why it's useful. Yeah.               |
| 54:30      | Oh, it's brutal. That's the thing, it's not, it absolutely is not useful for even somebody like         |
| 54:38      | me, but going through that tips app, I always want to know what are people seeing first, right?         |
| 54:44      | And people who are picking up their first iPhone and learning stuff. And I noticed, oh,                 |
| 54:50      | shortcuts is a big part of that. And immediately takes the apps that you already have on your phone     |
| 54:57      | and will be like, Hey, you know, you can create, you can make this thing to show your VIP               |
| 55:05      | inbox in mail, and then start a new draft to this specific person in your VIP inbox.                    |
| 55:12      | And I just thought that was really, really exciting that you don't have to do anything.                 |
| 55:18      | And already, [[Drafts]] are being, I'm sorry, shortcuts are being suggested to you. And I think             |
| 55:25      | other than, I mean, really health and time tracking are my biggest shortcuts that I use every single    |
| 55:34      | day. I used to use a lot more because they, you know, like calendar events or inaction was just         |
| 55:44      | take me to next event. And that puts me, you know, takes the calendar event, puts the address           |
| 55:53      | into maps, and then also text the people or emails, the people who are on the calendar invite,          |
| 56:01      | and gives my approximate arrival time, which because I used to be very late to a lot of                 |
| 56:09      | things, which was just the nature of my job. Either change video speed shortcut in here,                |
| 56:15      | which I don't suggest people use, but sometimes people talk really, really slowly on YouTube videos,    |
| 56:23      | or if you're watching a David Sparks Field Guide, which is amazing, but you just want to go through     |
| 56:29      | the parts that you already know to get to the updated parts about shortcuts, maybe you speed            |
| 56:34      | up that video a little bit. I think a lot of people speed up my voice. Every time I meet a              |
| 56:41      | listener, they're like, wow, I didn't realise what you sound like at 1x. And then they usually say      |
| 56:48      | that when I listen to me at 1x, I sound like I'm high all the time. And I am from California,           |
| 56:53      | but I am not high. I'm just a slow thinker. Sorry, guys. For me, it's very confusing,                   |
| 57:00      | because I listened, obviously, to my para users and focused. And so I'm used to listening to you.       |
| 57:05      | I think it's around 1.5 speed. That's what Overcast is said to by default for me. And then              |
| 57:10      | we're talking, and I'm there going, huh, oh, yeah, yeah, we're talking. Like, this is why David         |
| 57:14      | sounds like David. Is he ever going to finish the sentence? That's what you think. I do want to give    |
| 57:23      | two shout outs to my current favourite shortcut or apps that work in tandem with shortcuts,              |
| 57:33      | which is Charty and [[Data Jar]]. Because, I mean, what Charty does in terms of taking                     |
| 57:41      | your data and sort of helping you make sense of it, like I was noting before with the COVID             |
| 57:47      | tracking shortcut, as well as a shortcut called Omni Focus Day that our friend Scotty Jackson made,       |
| 57:56      | is just, I don't know, [[Drafts]] and, or I'm sorry, data just comforts me for some reason. And I think     |
| 58:05      | a lot of nerds have that as well. And I really like [[Data Jar]] as sort of kind of similar to [[Drafts]],       |
| 58:16      | a repository of information that shortcuts can just pull from. Like when I am recently,                 |
| 58:23      | I've actually been tracking the amount of caffeine I've been having. And for a bunch of boring reasons, |
| 58:31      | I keep that outside of WaterMinder. And in [[Data Jar]], I'm just able to keep the                           |
| 58:38      | certain amounts of caffeine I have. And then shortcuts gives me an option of like,                      |
| 58:44      | which caffeine amount did you consume? And then it creates a little chart from that out of [[Data Jar]]      |
| 58:52      | is in information. Like it's wild. Also, I did not build that one either. But I'm starting to really    |
| 59:02      | wrap my head around the things that I can do with [[Data Jar]] to, for myself. For example, I'm              |
| 59:11      | creating a shortcut that tells me what I'm going to wear every day, because I have a very limited,      |
| 59:19      | but by choice, very limited wardrobe. And I kind of like to trick people into thinking that I           |
| 59:26      | dress like a normal person. So it'll be like, yes, a t-shirt you wear every day, pair it with           |
| 59:32      | this button up shirt you have. And if like, if this button up shirt, then that pair of jeans,           |
| 59:38      | because I know that navy and black aren't supposed to go together. But my brain doesn't want to think   |
| 59:45      | about that in the morning. Just like how, at night, I don't want to think about what I should           |
| 59:50      | have to binge watch because my brain is so fried. So I have a shortcut that just pulls from a list      |
| 59:58      | of movies and TVs, movies or TV shows I want to watch. And then it will pick something random.          |
| 01:00:05   | And I watch that. Okay, Alex, I just got to interrupt there. You are such a geek. I know.               |
| 01:00:12   | So much. This is great. I really need to do something with my wardrobe because I realised               |
| 01:00:16   | that over the last three weeks, I've worn the same pair of jeans. I've got like two pairs of jeans      |
| 01:00:21   | and three dresses. And that's what I've cycled through. Like everything's been clean and laundered      |
| 01:00:25   | regularly. But I've not touched the rest of my wardrobe. And I really ought to fix that.                |
| 01:00:31   | Yeah, it's funny how all three of us are like, how do we find ways to not think about what we           |
| 01:00:36   | wear? For me, I just go to REI and I buy everything in the same line. And every day I just grab a       |
| 01:00:41   | shirt and a pair of pants and they match. I don't even think about it. The thing is, unfortunately,     |
| 01:00:47   | David, I bet, well, one, you are a very snappy dresser. But when I've seen you, it is all very          |
| 01:00:55   | like similar clothing. And then people don't really notice that. With women or non-binary people,       |
| 01:01:02   | it becomes like, you've worn that dress to every wedding you've been to the past two years.             |
| 01:01:10   | It's way harder for you guys. I agree.                                                                  |
| 01:01:13   | Well, that's, and I mean, I hate to pull like, oh, wait a minute, good card. But also, I've             |
| 01:01:20   | passed this along actually to my friends who are really into jewelry and watches because it's also      |
| 01:01:26   | a way to, I don't know, it comes up with interesting combinations you might not have thought of.        |
| 01:01:33   | And this was actually inspired by the movie Clueless, where the main character has this                 |
| 01:01:41   | like high-tech closet where she can just push buttons and then it pulls out the outfit she              |
| 01:01:47   | wants. And I'm like, yeah, that is what I want. So how does it work, though, the shortcut? Is it        |
| 01:01:53   | running in a random number generator against a list or what is it doing?                                |
| 01:01:59   | Yes. And this one is, I added, it pulled, my pants are just pulled from a random list that I put        |
| 01:02:09   | in a text field in shortcuts. But I'm trying to make it so that I have, it pulls from [[Data Jar]]          |
| 01:02:16   | so that I can have a store of, is that what it's called? Yes, yes, for, I mean, get it all the          |
| 01:02:28   | way down to underwear, like, all right. And also, I want a way to automate laundry, which I know        |
| 01:02:36   | Rose has been doing some Pushcut stuff with that, so that I can push a, you know, when I say          |
| 01:02:42   | something, I want an OmniFocus action of like, okay, laundry is complete. And then it adds              |
| 01:02:49   | back the clothing that is clean back into that rotation. So that's kind of what I've been fiddling      |
| 01:02:55   | with in my, well, I would never commit time theft for my jobby job. But, you know, part of my job       |
| 01:03:02   | is to look presentable on Zoom calls. And yeah, I mean, you can see from my waist up. So,               |
| 01:03:10   | and the other one is just a random list. And I think [[Matthew Cassinelli]] taught me how to make           |
| 01:03:18   | those from actually a shortcut he made that was pull a random episode of the office up for me,          |
| 01:03:28   | because he had watched the office so many times. And so now I have the same thing with the Simpsons,    |
| 01:03:33   | but unfortunately, there's nothing you can do to have, like, I gosh, I wish that [[Apple]] or TVOS          |
| 01:03:43   | or whatever it's called, would get its stuff together and work with shortcuts more because I            |
| 01:03:48   | want to push a button and then just have what I'm watching pop up on the screen. Like, yep,             |
| 01:03:55   | all right. Soak over me, Sideshow Bob. Let's just, let's just get into this and then fall asleep.       |
| 01:04:02   | I think you need to hand off that that clothing script to Rose and then come back in a month and        |
| 01:04:07   | it'll be like amazing. Oh, yeah, it's going to be like, all right, which size sock do you want?         |
| 01:04:14   | Well, I mean, I would certainly be interested in playing more with that. But and the other thing        |
| 01:04:20   | is, is I've been experimenting a little bit with an app called Stylebook, which, you know, can tell     |
| 01:04:24   | you, you know, you take a photo of your outfit every day and you put all the different pieces           |
| 01:04:27   | of your wardrobe in there with photos and stuff, but it doesn't really have the automation side         |
| 01:04:33   | of things, which is a real shame. And I would, you know, I'd love to see some more fun nerdy stuff      |
| 01:04:39   | out of that because there's so many possibilities. Oh, yeah, for sure. I mean, and the one, I will      |
| 01:04:46   | probably be asking you this, but some of the if actions, I mess up, not because they are broken,        |
| 01:04:54   | but not because the shortcut is broken, but because I'm like, well, those clothes don't match           |
| 01:05:00   | after I put them on. And my spouse is like, you sure you want to wear that today? So it's,              |
| 01:05:07   | I look to people who are more fashion conscious like yourself to help me build that out.                |
| 01:05:13   | Well, there's so much that you can do with this stuff. And it's all, I mean, at the end of the          |
| 01:05:16   | day, providing you are enjoying the automation when you create it, or the result genuinely saves        |
| 01:05:22   | you time or make your life easier in a way by removing decisions that you might need to make            |
| 01:05:26   | so that you can avoid decision fatigue, then I think it's a win. Yeah. And it's interesting             |
| 01:05:31   | because she made one for clothing first, but then my guess is once you made it, like, oh,               |
| 01:05:37   | yeah, I could also apply this to media. And you probably use a lot of the same tools. I have a,         |
| 01:05:43   | I have a little tip for the media, which is to explore Plex because Plex has web hooks.                 |
| 01:05:49   | So you can do fancy stuff with that. And I love the fact that I can pick, like, I can use my phone,     |
| 01:05:55   | the Plex app on my phone as basically a remote for my television and then say, hey, play this thing.    |
| 01:06:01   | And so with the addition of a couple of shortcuts, which are, I've got a shortcut,                      |
| 01:06:06   | which literally just turns on my [[Apple TV]] and tells it to open the Plex app. And then it opens          |
| 01:06:12   | the Plex app on my phone so I can pick something and then it just goes over. And that is beautiful.     |
| 01:06:19   | And it works. And it's also fairly other people friendly if you have, you know,                         |
| 01:06:23   | other people in your household, which I know both of you do.                                            |
| 01:06:26   | See, I think this is like a KC lists conspiracy to finally get me to set up or even just use            |
| 01:06:34   | other people's Plex libraries because, yeah, it's, it's awesome. I just haven't,                        |
| 01:06:39   | that's a lie. It's not that I haven't had the time. It's one of those things that it was like           |
| 01:06:45   | decision fatigue. I'm like, well, why do I want to put it in my Plex library?                           |
| 01:06:48   | I have everything that you have as a media file. So in my case, I copied all of my things from          |
| 01:06:54   | DVDs a very long time ago. I've still got the DVD stack floating around somewhere in my parent's house. |
| 01:06:58   | Don't tell them. They don't need to know that it's there. But, well, I don't have space for it.         |
| 01:07:03   | Exactly. So I have all of this stuff. So I've got like the entire season of friends,                    |
| 01:07:10   | like all of it and stuff like that. And it's, for me, it's great because it's just all there.           |
| 01:07:16   | And then I've just, you know, click a thing and it shows up and it shows me all the things.             |
| 01:07:20   | And it tracks what I've watched with Trek.TV as well, TRAsKT.TV. So I actually know what I've           |
| 01:07:27   | watched. So theoretically, I could even hook into that and see, you know, what have I already           |
| 01:07:32   | watched or what did I watch recently so that I don't end up, you know, watching                         |
| 01:07:36   | the same thing two days in a row, because that's what the random number generator picked.               |
| 01:07:40   | Because of course, true random means that you could have the same thing two times in a row.             |
| 01:07:44   | I'm with you. I had Plex installed years ago and then I just, I don't watch enough TV to                |
| 01:07:50   | justify all that investment of setting it up, you know?                                                 |
| 01:07:53   | I just have my running on a Raspberry Pi with an eight terabyte drive plugged into it.                  |
| 01:07:57   | And it's just sitting here on the side of my desk and it's basically silent. Now,                       |
| 01:08:03   | the trick, if you're going to use the Raspberry Pi is you don't want your                               |
| 01:08:05   | media to need re-encoding. So if it needs re-encoding, then you need a much more powerful               |
| 01:08:09   | machine. But all of my stuff, when I ripped it, I formatted it so that I could play it.                 |
| 01:08:13   | Like it was originally in iTunes so that I could use iTunes home sharing. I think it was called         |
| 01:08:21   | back in the day where you would have your Mac on and then you could play it on the [[Apple TV]]             |
| 01:08:26   | or your iPad or something. And then after, for a while, I switched over to [[Infuse]] and just shared       |
| 01:08:31   | the drive on my network, which worked pretty well. And then I decided that actually I wanted            |
| 01:08:36   | it to be available outside of my network and for my parents to also be able to access it.               |
| 01:08:40   | So I switched over to Plex. That's actually really interesting that you use a Raspberry Pi              |
| 01:08:46   | because I have a very, I have a very old TV. So I have like ripped a bunch of Blu-rays, but I don't,    |
| 01:08:53   | I don't need them at a super high quality. And I have a ton of files that were ripped from DVDs         |
| 01:08:59   | from Handbrake. And I had some, I think I had an [[AppleScript]]. It's lost to time, but it would,         |
| 01:09:07   | you know, rip things from Handbrake and then put it into iTunes and then form, what was it called?      |
| 01:09:12   | Like Front Row, which is like a little movie theatre in your Mac. And that's such a good idea           |
| 01:09:19   | because it's definitely on an old, like an archived media drive somewhere. I just don't want            |
| 01:09:24   | a Synology. It's right now, I just, I don't want another box in my life. Well, my parents have a        |
| 01:09:30   | Synology, which has a couple of things that I copied onto their Synology for them so that               |
| 01:09:35   | they didn't have to stream my stuff over the internet. And that works pretty well. But yeah,            |
| 01:09:40   | if you don't want another box in your life, then Raspberry Pi is not a bad way to play with it.         |
| 01:09:44   | And they're fairly cheap as well, though. I say that as the person who of course got the version        |
| 01:09:48   | with 16 gigabytes of RAM because it's also running Homebridge, Pi Hall, and a couple of other nifty     |
| 01:09:53   | little utilities. This episode of The Automators is brought to you by ExpressVPN. High speed,           |

| 01:10:08   |/automators. Have you ever wondered why internet access is so much cheaper these days,             |
| 01:10:14   | like 30 to 40 bucks a month? It's because some of the big internet service providers aren't just        |
| 01:10:19   | making money off your subscription fees. They're also making money from spying on your internet         |
| 01:10:24   | activities and selling your library history and data to big tech companies. So what's the best          |
| 01:10:29   | way to make sure that 100% of your data is encrypted and that your internet provider can't get a hold   |
| 01:10:34   | of it? Yep, ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN creates a secure tunnel between all of your devices and the          |
| 01:10:42   | internet so that everything you do online is encrypted. It reroutes your connection through             |
| 01:10:47   | a secure server. This blocks your internet provider from seeing everything that you do online.          |
| 01:10:52   | All they can see is that you're connected to an ExpressVPN server, but nothing beyond that.             |
| 01:10:58   | And it's not just for your phone or computer. ExpressVPN works on all of your devices. It               |
| 01:11:03   | works on your tablets, smart TVs, even your router so your entire family can always stay protected.     |
| 01:11:09   | I can't stress this enough. ExpressVPN is so simple to use. You just open the app, tap one button       |
| 01:11:15   | to connect, and that's it. I've been using ExpressVPN for years. I keep it turned on. I just don't      |
| 01:11:22   | even think about it. To turn it on, you open the app and press the button and that's all there is to    |
| 01:11:27   | it. I don't notice any lag in internet performance. My devices work just as they did before, but I'm    |
| 01:11:33   | secure and not sharing my data with the world. Security is important these days and I think             |
| 01:11:39   | everyone should have a VPN service and ExpressVPN is the service that I trust. Your data is your        |
| 01:11:46   | business. Protect it at expressvpn.com/automators. Visit expressvpn.com/automators          |

| 01:12:10   | Before the break, Rose, you had said that you were using your Raspberry Pi for a whole lot              |
| 01:12:14   | of stuff, including [[HomeKit]]. Alex, have you ever gone down that rabbit hole?                            |
| 01:12:20   | I have just started to. Well, I should say I've been living down the rabbit hole,                       |
| 01:12:25   | but now I'm kind of crawling out with things that are actually useful and work.                         |
| 01:12:30   | Yes, because I mean, my two favourite robots in my home or rather the things I've made into robots       |
| 01:12:39   | are my humidifier and my air filter. I know that's way more important to folks like yourself in         |
| 01:12:52   | California. Unfortunately, because of the air quality, so many interesting automation scripts           |
| 01:13:00   | have come out of that, which it really sucks. Wildfires, source of automation.                          |
| 01:13:11   | I think using, I actually couldn't even say what I was using, probably Scriptable just to               |
| 01:13:18   | sort of archive and chart the air quality, but I was like, okay, there aren't many appliances           |
| 01:13:27   | in my home that are actually [[HomeKit]] compatible or let alone any sort of smart device, but by           |
| 01:13:36   | using something like Wemo, which I think is [[HomeKit]] compatible, just saying like, okay,                |
| 01:13:43   | Siri ball, turn, okay, Siri ball, make the air better, so then the humidifier and the air filter come on  |
| 01:13:56   | and it's just beautiful, but then I'm like, all right, what if I can do all of that so that the         |
| 01:14:02   | air is actually humid, it is cleaning out the cat allergens, but then my lovely Roomba                  |
| 01:14:10   | is also cleaning at the same time and sure, you can set your Roomba to start cleaning at a certain      |
| 01:14:17   | time, but I just want to use that ambient computing and just say what I want and then have everything   |
| 01:14:25   | in my house start to clean and I'm not there yet because I tried to get some things to start my         |
| 01:14:34   | dishwasher into start my laundry machines, but unfortunately, there are dials involved and              |
| 01:14:41   | whatnot, so I've been using, in order to like track when something starts and when something            |
| 01:14:48   | ends, so I get an alert, not a cool push cut alert that I'm sure at some point on some show             |
| 01:14:54   | Rose is going to get into, but I just have little NFC tags that use shortcut automations that           |
| 01:15:01   | set will be like, all right, 30 minute timer and then, okay, time to empty the dryer, empty the         |
| 01:15:10   | dishes and stuff like that and Homebridge, wow, what a beast, but luckily with everybody staying        |
| 01:15:20   | at home a lot of the time, I think the Homebridge ecosystem has really started expanding and            |
| 01:15:26   | people are using Pushcut more and we're kind of in this like overall dark place in the world,         |
| 01:15:34   | but we're all getting into home automation since we're here all the darn time.                          |
| 01:15:41   | Yeah, I have also been diving into this a lot, and I don't have a Roomba, I have a [[eufy]] robot         |
| 01:15:49   | vacuum, her name's Buttercup from the Princess Bride, but she, but unfortunately to get your [[eufy]]    |
| 01:15:56   | into Homebridge, the person who wrote the plug-in, you need to get the device ID and                    |
| 01:16:03   | something else and unfortunately to do this, I had to set up an Android emulator and do like            |
| 01:16:10   | network tracing and stuff like that, I actually have an Android phone and so to start with,             |
| 01:16:13   | I was like, surely it's gonna be easier to use this and I started looking at everything and I           |
| 01:16:17   | was like, yeah, I'm just gonna follow like the vague, they weren't really instructions, it was more     |
| 01:16:22   | like sort of signposts and you just have to keep going and there's a fork in the road and there's       |
| 01:16:26   | no sign and you're like, okay, left or right, I'm just gonna go with left and figure out if I'm         |
| 01:16:31   | wrong, I'll go back and go right. So that was an interesting experiment, not one I can necessarily      |
| 01:16:36   | 100% recommend, the instructions there could use some improvement, maybe I should write them up and     |
| 01:16:40   | do a GitHub pull request on that to help some other people in the future.                               |
| 01:16:44   | I just love that Rose set up an Android emulator to make her robot back work, it's so precious.         |
| 01:16:51   | Okay, so I set it up so that when the last person leaves home, which is pretty much always going        |
| 01:16:56   | to be me, I did add my parents to my home kit set up so that when they visit, it's also aware of        |
| 01:17:01   | them existing and so if I leave them when, you know, like if they're here and I have to run out         |
| 01:17:08   | and grab something, then, you know, it doesn't turn off all the lights and start the robot vacuuming.   |
| 01:17:13   | So I've got it when the last person leaves it vacuums and then I went out twice in one day              |
| 01:17:17   | and my robot vacuumed again. And I was like, oh, this, this is not smart, it should only really         |
| 01:17:22   | vacuum once in a day when I go out. And so I ended up setting up, there's a plugin called Homebridge    |
| 01:17:29   | dummy, where you can create dummy plugs and I now have a room in my home called logic,                  |
| 01:17:35   | which contains among other things, an eight hour counter for my lava lamp. So when my lava lamp         |
| 01:17:39   | turns on, it turns on the eight hour counter. And then at the end of the hour counter, it will          |
| 01:17:43   | automatically turn my lava lamp off. If my lava lamp is still on, if my lava lamp, however, turns       |
| 01:17:47   | off, then it will automatically do, it will automatically turn off the timer. And then,                 |
| 01:17:56   | there's some other stuff in there, but one of the switches, it's a fake switch, it says,                |
| 01:18:01   | robot vacuum is cleaned. So I can say, hey, if it hasn't cleaned today, then, you know,                 |
| 01:18:08   | go ahead and clean, please. Yeah. Just for the nature of completion, I've got to tell you the           |
| 01:18:15   | name of my robot back because, you know, Buttercup is pretty good. But mine is Moe. I named him after   |
| 01:18:22   | that little robot in Wally, you know, the little robot that follows Wally and cleans everything.        |
| 01:18:26   | Oh, that's so good. Mine is named Romper after Mr. Romper in an Archer episode. He's an evil clown.     |
| 01:18:35   | I truly don't remember why we named him that. I think it was just we had purchased a Roomba,            |
| 01:18:42   | and then we're watching an episode of Archer, and like, that's a funny name. It shall romper            |
| 01:18:47   | around the house cleaning, which I'm pretty sure my dog thinks of my robot back as an evil clown.       |
| 01:18:53   | So that would work too. So Alex Cox, you start the show telling us how you're not an automator,         |
| 01:19:00   | and you've created shortcuts to pick your clothing for you, and you're running Homebridge on your       |
| 01:19:06   | home vac. So I think you're a liar. Trying to run Homebridge. I think you're a liar. But I do            |
| 01:19:13   | understand what you say about like trying to learn this stuff. Are there any areas of automation        |
| 01:19:18   | that you're looking to go deeper on that you just haven't got to yet? And what, you know,               |
| 01:19:22   | what are you thinking about in the future as an automator? Absolutely. Keyboard,                        |
| 01:19:28   | maestro, and [[BetterTouchTool]], because I am primarily a trackpad person. I always have been            |
| 01:19:37   | because until this year, I think this this year, I got an iMac pro for work, and it's been              |
| 01:19:46   | amazing. But I literally haven't used a desktop as my main computer since my first iMac when I was      |
| 01:19:53   | 11. So I mean, there's so much to do with [[BetterTouchTool]]. And with keyword, maestro, I forget        |
| 01:20:04   | who started the [[Stream Deck]] trend. But wow, the [[Stream Deck]] is so cool. And I still don't really        |
| 01:20:13   | know what to do with it. But I know I want to do a lot of things with it. But I'm also cautious         |
| 01:20:19   | about going down these rabbit holes, because, you know, I don't know when this is coming out,           |
| 01:20:24   | but the [[Apple Silicon]] event is or well, there's some [[Apple]] event next week. And I have a feeling        |
| 01:20:30   | that I might be purchasing a personal computer after that. And I don't know what's gonna happen.        |
| 01:20:37   | Like when I really hope that shortcuts is coming to the Mac, I bet it's not. I mean, I'm sure it's      |
| 01:20:44   | not going to be for like another year or so. But since I'm at a point in my life now, where I           |
| 01:20:51   | sure I'm gonna be able to spend like a weekend, if I can, rebuilding and changing things up,            |
| 01:20:56   | I just have less time to automate to change the automations I have that are somewhat essential          |
| 01:21:05   | to my workflow. So I've kind of been cautious the same way I was cautious about using workflow          |
| 01:21:11   | before it became shortcuts. And honestly, that paid off. Like losing all the if the tub                 |
| 01:21:20   | actions was a huge bummer for a lot of people. And I was like, Oh, thank God, I don't have any          |
| 01:21:27   | with that integrated into workflow. But now I think shortcuts is in a place where,                      |
| 01:21:34   | unless you're doing something really wild, or you're on the beta, which I often am,                     |
| 01:21:39   | and I often break things. Otherwise, it's really stable and reliable. And I mean, I know that           |
| 01:21:48   | that [[BetterTouchTool]] has been around forever. It's just again, like what form factors are             |
| 01:21:55   | going to be new? Like, am I going to be the person who when we travel again, I want to bring a stream   |
| 01:22:01   | deck? I don't know. Again, my iPhone is really my main computer. And I sort of build everything         |
| 01:22:12   | I do around like, what can I have access to on my iPhone? Because that's going to be what I need        |
| 01:22:20   | to use in the real world. Does that sort of make make sense? Yeah, it does. And I think if you're       |
| 01:22:27   | since you're already fluent in shortcuts, I think you're going to find keyboard my show very easy.      |
| 01:22:31   | It's a, I think keyboard my show is a little nerdier, but it's also a little more powerful too,         |
| 01:22:36   | because you can like run [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]] to virtually do anything on your Mac that                        |
| 01:22:41   | that you're going to go crazy. Once you get into keyboard my show, you're going to have a bunch         |
| 01:22:45   | of, you know, you're going to have a bunch of scripts. Just that'll be great. That's what I             |
| 01:22:49   | actually found with with these, I don't want to call them legacy Mac apps, because that makes           |
| 01:22:55   | it sound as if they're not still being actively developed. But because they've been around so           |
| 01:23:01   | long, there's so much documentation. There's, there's so many scripts out there that I even             |
| 01:23:09   | have like instructions on how to modify them. And that that is really exciting, because when I open     |
| 01:23:16   | up, when I open up these apps, I'm like, Oh, God, Oh, no, Oh, no. Like the first time I opened Devon    |
| 01:23:23   | think, which is another one of those apps that I really, really love. And it's kind of becoming my      |
| 01:23:29   | main archival tool. But I don't like that I have to have it running in the background on my at          |
| 01:23:36   | iMac to make sure that it's always up to date on my phone. It's worked great so far. But, you know,     |
| 01:23:43   | you never know what [[Apple]] will do in the next version of Mac OS.                                        |
| 01:23:48   | Yeah. Yeah, but that's, and that's where automation comes in, you could run a script to like just       |
| 01:23:53   | open it up at 2am every day. And that's what I do actually. Yeah, I stole that from you. Yeah.          |
| 01:23:58   | And it is, but I mean, you are so far down the road on automation, I just can't wait to hear            |
| 01:24:05   | what you make next. And we're going to have to have you on again in the future. I mean, you've          |
| 01:24:10   | got your wardrobe handled, you got your watching system handled. You're an automator, Alex.             |
| 01:24:19   | Thank you. I really look forward to seeing what Rose, you do with your apartment and David, what        |
| 01:24:27   | you end up doing to your home, what your family will allow. And I'm just excited for this world         |
| 01:24:37   | of, I'll use the silly phrase again, ambient computing, or that great idea that you brought up          |
| 01:24:44   | with contextual computing and cognitive computing. Yeah, I think that really is something that is       |
| 01:24:50   | a natural for automators. I can tell you, like, for example, the way I do that with                     |
| 01:24:55   | them, [[Keyboard Maestro]] is I just have three phases of my life. There's MacSparky,                      |
| 01:25:01   | personal and legal. And if I hold down control option command, and I hit LM or P,                       |
| 01:25:08   | it just gives me a menu of all the most common things I do in that area of my life. One of them         |
| 01:25:14   | may be check legal email, you know, I hit one button, and it's a conflict palette. It just              |
| 01:25:19   | takes me to my legal email inbox. I don't see the MacSparky inbox. So, you know, I go straight         |
| 01:25:24   | to the one that I need to see. And the inspiration for that really was shortcuts, because of            |
| 01:25:29   | shortcuts, I had created all these choose from menu shortcuts because of limitations of shortcuts.      |
| 01:25:35   | But it makes sense on the Mac too. And this is fun stuff to dig into, because it allows you             |
| 01:25:42   | to go and Luke had talked about this on that recent MacSparky episode, the two second rule,            |
| 01:25:47   | you know, from the thought, the moment you have the thought, I want to do something to the time         |
| 01:25:50   | you're doing something on a computer should be two seconds. If it's longer, there's a chance            |
| 01:25:57   | you're going to get distracted. Anytime you open a web browser or an email app or any of these,         |
| 01:26:00   | there's a good chance something is going to grab your attention, and you're not going to do the         |
| 01:26:04   | thing you meant to do. Absolutely. Well, either way, Alex, where can people find you? You can           |
| 01:26:12   | find all of my terribleness at twitter.com/Alex Cox bill cox not the other way,                   |
| 01:26:21   | and or Alex Cox dot me or Alex Cox dot gay, I have many URL. But if you want to check out my two        |
| 01:26:31   | main projects right now, you can visit do by Friday dot com. And that is my show with Merlin            |
| 01:26:38   | man, where each week we give each other a challenge to try out something new that could be watch a      |
| 01:26:46   | new TV show or try out a new automation or this week survive the 2020 presidential election.            |
| 01:26:56   | And then the other show I have is with my spouse. It's called to head a girl and you can find it        |
| 01:27:03   | at two headed girl dot com. And yes, that is a neutral milk hotel reference. And it is kind of          |
| 01:27:09   | a personal journal type of show where we talk about our feelings surrounding gender and mental          |
| 01:27:19   | illness and how our experiences and our attitudes towards it have changed throughout our lives as       |
| 01:27:29   | being you know, queer teenagers to queer 20 year olds to queer 30 year olds. So it's very it's more     |
| 01:27:39   | like documentary weird, not quite a podcast that most I think most of the people in our circle          |
| 01:27:51   | listen to. So I would ask that you try to listen to it. And if you don't like it, there might be        |
| 01:27:57   | somebody in your life who would I can tell you, I didn't really sure making that show until we          |
| 01:28:02   | started prepping. And then last week, I found myself evacuated in with a lot of free time.              |
| 01:28:08   | So I went and listened and I really enjoyed that show because it gave me perspective and                |
| 01:28:14   | knowledge I didn't have, you know, and I would say that anybody could benefit from listening to         |
| 01:28:18   | that show. I think you guys do a great job with it. So I give that one a gold star and recommendation   |
| 01:28:24   | too. All right, we are the automators, you can find us at automators.fm, you can find the forums        |
