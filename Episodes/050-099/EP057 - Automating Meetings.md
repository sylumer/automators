| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automated. My name is Rosemary Orchard, and as always, I'm joined                   |
| 00:06      | by my fellow co-host, David Sparks. Hey, David, how are you today?                                        |
| 00:09      | I am great, Rosemary. Except we're talking about meetings today, so I'm a little anxious.                 |
| 00:15      | Yeah, well, it's one of these things. Meetings, especially nowadays with, you know, whole global          |
| 00:20      | pandemic, there's a lot of extra meetings I'm finding. Meetings that previously would                     |
| 00:25      | not have been meetings. Because you might have just run into somebody in the corridor,                    |
| 00:29      | but you can't just run into somebody in the corridor nowadays because smart social distancing.            |
| 00:34      | So we thought we'd figure out how to automate, you know, one of those pesky meetings away                 |
| 00:37      | and get you some time back. Yeah, I feel like with the pandemic, everybody                                |
| 00:42      | thought they'd get less meetings, but now that everybody has figured out how Zoom works,                  |
| 00:46      | it feels like there's more meetings. Yeah, my workplace has Zoom, GoTo Meeting, and                        |
| 00:52      | Microsoft Teams. Oh, great. That's just awesome.                                                          |
| 00:55      | Yeah. The thing that I've noticed is Teams and stuff is smart. It will let you be in                      |
| 01:01      | multiple meetings at the same time, which I've discovered is why we have three different                  |
| 01:05      | systems because people expect me to sort of listen to three different meetings at the                     |
| 01:09      | same time, which does not work. There's no way I can do it. And so I've just been declining               |
| 01:14      | lots and lots of meetings and saying, no, sorry, I have another meeting at that time.                     |
| 01:19      | Take a different spot. And that kind of brings me to the first part of automating a meeting               |
| 01:26      | because there's meeting invitations and actually scheduling meetings because that's always                |
| 01:32      | the tricky thing. The last thing that I like to see is an email thread of 20 different,                   |
| 01:37      | hey, so can you do this time? 9am, Tuesday? No, sorry, I've got a doctor's appointment                    |
| 01:40      | at 9am, Tuesday. How about 9am, Wednesday? Oh, no, 9am, Wednesday is no good for me.                      |
| 01:45      | How about 10.30 on Tuesday? And six hours later, you've got 300 emails in your inbox                      |
| 01:50      | from the 20 people who theoretically have to attend this meeting. And you've just wasted                  |
| 01:57      | what feels like an entire day trying to arrange a meeting. And there are so many better solutions         |
| 02:01      | to that out there. Yeah. And I think one of the things you have to look at is how many                    |
| 02:06      | people are going to be in the meeting. I would say the first automator slash productivity                 |
| 02:11      | tip on this, if it's just like a meeting with one other person, one of the easiest ways                   |
| 02:15      | to solve that is just to propose a time when you're like, hey, Rose, let's get on the phone.              |
| 02:21      | How about next Tuesday at 2pm? And then it's done. So quite often people will be like,                    |
| 02:27      | well, yes, David, Tuesday at 2pm would be just fine. And then you don't have to deal                      |
| 02:31      | with all of that. Another good tool that kind of brings automation to play for the one-on-one             |
| 02:38      | or maybe three-person meetings, Fantastical has a new feature if you're a subscriber where                |
| 02:45      | you can send out multiple meetings and or meeting proposals and they get a nice web page.                  |
| 02:52      | They don't have to be Fantastical subscribers for it to work, but the recipients get an                   |
| 02:57      | email and they can just click the one they want. And then that sets the meeting for you.                  |
| 03:02      | Yes. Now, the automator tool that makes that                                                              |
| 03:04      | cool is that when you send out the proposals, Fantastical will reserve all of those times                 |
| 03:09      | on your calendar because nothing is more frustrating than sending out three proposals to somebody         |
| 03:16      | and because you have the time available, but they wait three days to reply to you. And then               |
| 03:20      | when they get back and reply, of course, all that time is booked now. And you sound like                  |
| 03:25      | a jerk for saying, well, now I can't do it because you waited too long, but I find that                   |
| 03:30      | quite frustrating. Yeah, yeah.                                                                            |
| 03:32      | And that's another tip that I would throw in there. I actually have, I have most email                    |
| 03:37      | notifications turned off, but what I've done is I've got a mail rule. So I'm using mail                   |
| 03:42      | on my work machine and I have it flag or colour any meeting invitations that come in in red                |
| 03:49      | so that I can quickly scan and see all of those meeting invitations and just go yes                       |
| 03:53      | or no to every single one of them because they're red and they're in my inbox. And when                   |
| 03:57      | I accept or decline them, they disappear out of my inbox. So that helps me with that. And                 |
| 04:03      | I should figure out something. I use Google mail as the back end for my domain email.                     |
| 04:09      | Should figure out something with that as well so that whenever I get Fantastical invites                  |
| 04:13      | from you, then it's like, hey, David, you're a super important email. Deal with this. Maybe               |
| 04:18      | it sends me a push cut notification. I don't know.                                                        |
| 04:20      | Well, I think you could do that again with an [[Apple Mail]] rule because Fantastical tags                    |
| 04:25      | those males. So yeah, I just have to see what I think the subject line has the same text                  |
| 04:30      | all the time.                                                                                             |
| 04:31      | Except for the fact that I don't use Apple Mail on my personal side of things. I'm currently              |
| 04:35      | using [[Airmail]] and I like to make sure that everything works. So I tend to do things like                  |
| 04:39      | that on the server side. But yeah, there are plenty of options and Fantastical's.                          |
| 04:44      | Kind of digression for a second. You're using Airmail and Apple Mail at the same time. Airmail            |
| 04:50      | when you try to save a link to a mail uses an Airmail link. Yes. And Apple Mail does                      |
| 04:56      | not. Doesn't that drive you crazy having two separate sources for those links?                            |
| 05:01      | No, because my work mail is done with Apple Mail and then my personal stuff is done with                  |
| 05:07      | Airmail. So it works perfectly segregated.                                                                |
| 05:10      | The only thing is is in mail on my iOS device. I also have one of my personal accounts enabled            |
| 05:17      | because whenever you try to send a bug report in an app, it defaults to the mail app at                   |
| 05:23      | the moment because we haven't got as far in the iOS 14 beta as setting a new default                      |
| 05:29      | mail apps or new default browsers. And so I do have a personal, my personal mail enabled                  |
| 05:35      | in mail on my iPhone, but I also have notifications entirely turned off for that. So it doesn't           |
| 05:40      | bug me fortunately.                                                                                       |
| 05:41      | Yeah, they announced a big update to Airmail. So I installed it just to see how it's doing.               |
| 05:46      | And of course it added those four or five folders to my system. I'm like, Airmail, why                    |
| 05:51      | you got to keep doing this to me?                                                                         |
| 05:54      | Well, I've just given up and I leave those there because the custom automations inside                    |
| 06:00      | of Airmail make it easy, which, you know, is one of those things I can actually from                      |
| 06:04      | an, from an email in Airmail, you said this, a diversion, David, I don't think it is a                    |
| 06:09      | diversion. I think it's different. It's, it's leading me into the next thing. I can actually              |
| 06:14      | send an email to my calendar. And so I can take something where somebody has said to                      |
| 06:19      | me, Hey, do you think we should get together on Tuesday at 10? And I can actually just                    |
| 06:24      | add it to my calendar for Tuesday at 10, that email. And then I have that reference back                  |
| 06:28      | when I get to that meeting time Tuesday at 10, which is really handy for me.                              |
| 06:34      | Yeah, you can do the same thing with Apple Mail, but it requires a drag. You can drag                     |
| 06:38      | from the, like on iOS, you can drag from the Apple Mail to the, to the calendar event,                    |
| 06:44      | whether it's in Fantastical or the standard [[Apple Calendar|calendar]] app, the, the email links can come                      |
| 06:49      | over on the Mac. It's even easier. But you know, what we didn't talk about is what happens                |
| 06:54      | if you want to get together more than two or three people? What if you want to put six                    |
| 06:57      | people on a meeting? And there are some solutions for that too.                                           |
| 07:01      | Well, I try and avoid those meetings. But yeah, yeah, there are some solutions. One of the                |
| 07:07      | things I would say is if your organisation uses exchange, then exchange has a built-in                    |
| 07:12      | calendar in schedule tool where you can add all of your invitees and to a meeting and                     |
| 07:17      | then see when everybody's busy or free. Now this only works if they've let you see the                    |
| 07:22      | busy free side of their calendar, but it can be very useful. And it's, you know, if you're                |
| 07:28      | already using exchange, it's free. And I'm pretty certain if your organisation is using                   |
| 07:32      | G Suite, then you can see that as well. But I'm the only person in my organisation on                     |
| 07:36      | G Suite. So I've struggled to test that unsurprisingly. But that's a great solution.                      |
| 07:42      | And that does require everybody at the meeting to be in the same system.                                  |
| 07:45      | Yes, yeah, it does. And so, you know, it has its swings around about, but if it's an internal             |
| 07:50      | meeting and you've already got the system, then it also means that if somebody says,                      |
| 07:54      | oh, but I'm busy at that time, you can say, oh, but I didn't see that in your calendar.                   |
| 07:59      | And just remind people that possibly keeping that calendar up to date is usually a good                   |
| 08:02      | thing.                                                                                                    |
| 08:03      | Yeah, back when I was in the office in the firm, and we did, you know, we use the exchange                |
| 08:10      | calendar and system, I blocked off like almost all of my time. So no one could ever do that               |
| 08:14      | to me.                                                                                                    |
| 08:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 08:16      | It was, there's a very limited window where you could sneak into my calendar. But I guess                 |
| 08:21      | I have a bias against meetings anyway. But you do have occasionally need to put a meeting                 |
| 08:27      | together. And if you don't have a system like Exchange where it's all internal, or if you've              |
| 08:32      | got folks coming from, you know, other companies or people who are not on the team that are               |
| 08:37      | going to participate.                                                                                     |
| 08:39      | One of my favourites for this is Doodle, D-O-O-D-L-E. And it's just, it's always worked. You go            |
| 08:46      | there. I don't have an account. I've never given them any money, but you just go in there                 |
| 08:51      | and you list your availability and you send out a link. I just get the copy of the link                   |
| 08:56      | and I send it out in an email to everyone and say, just please go in and fill it out.                     |
| 09:00      | And it does fine.                                                                                         |
| 09:01      | Yeah, it works great. We both use this actually to sign up for something that we're going                 |
| 09:06      | to be on that's not automators related. And it worked great. I sign in to Doodle with                     |
| 09:11      | my Google account and I have the app installed on my iPhone. And this is great because if                 |
| 09:17      | somebody sends me a Doodle link, then I can open it on my phone and it automatically checks               |
| 09:21      | my calendar and sees, hey, you're busy at these times and just checks off the ones that                   |
| 09:26      | I'm available. And then I can go through manually modify it and then hit send and save it. And            |
| 09:32      | if you log in to Doodle when you are submitting your availability, then if something changes,             |
| 09:38      | you can go back in and change it later, which is pretty useful. So that's a bonus Doodle                  |
| 09:43      | tip for you there.                                                                                        |
| 09:44      | There you go. And I find I use that about once a month because I have to put a meeting                    |
| 09:49      | together for somebody. And even when it's a meeting I'm attending, like if someone invites                |
| 09:53      | me to a meeting and I just know that the email chain is about to start, you know what I mean,             |
| 10:00      | right? They're like, oh, do you want to come to this? And I, yeah, I'm just writing like,                 |
| 10:04      | well, Tuesday works for me. How about everybody else? And then so I just like take the initiative.        |
| 10:10      | Even though I was invited to the meeting, I'm like, yeah, I can do it. And here's a                       |
| 10:13      | Doodle for the meeting and I've already set my availability and then everybody can just                   |
| 10:18      | work off my availability. And it's, I don't know if it's passive aggressive, but it certainly             |
| 10:24      | just cuts down on all the email.                                                                          |
| 10:26      | Yes. And I wouldn't say it's passive aggressive. I would say you're taking the initiative.                |
| 10:32      | So, you know, that's a good thing. There are also some other great tools out there that                   |
| 10:37      | you can use to help organise meetings. Calendly is one, WhenWorks is another one, full disclosure.        |
| 10:42      | I own WhenWorks and I'm working on a big update. There's a couple of bucks with iOS 13, 14                 |
| 10:47      | at the moment, which I'm trying to iron out there, where you can basically set up appointment             |
| 10:51      | times or appointments that people can book and a textual calendar based on the criteria                   |
| 10:56      | you set up and just shows people basically a calendar where they can be like, oh yeah,                    |
| 11:01      | Tuesday at 1030 is the right time for me. And the beauty of these links is you can reuse                  |
| 11:06      | them. So you can always let, for example, David has a link for automators where he can                    |
| 11:10      | always book it and it will get added to the automators calendar. Now, I'm pretty certain,                 |
| 11:15      | David, that you've forgotten this link because it's usually like, hey, does Thursday at 10                |
| 11:19      | work for you? And the answer is pretty much always yes. You know, that's easier for us.                   |
| 11:26      | But services like that work great, especially if you're working and you're letting other                  |
| 11:30      | people book your time like clients or something and they want to, you know, pick your brains              |
| 11:35      | at a specific time for a specific length of time, then you can let them say book you for                  |
| 11:40      | an hour. And a lot of these services hook up to Zapier and stuff as well. WhenWorks doesn't                |
| 11:45      | yet. Calendly does. It's a great service. And that allows you to chain other automations                  |
| 11:51      | together too.                                                                                             |
| 11:52      | Now, I just want to stop for a minute. Rose owns WhenWorks, right? She just kind of said                   |
| 11:58      | that quickly. I thought Rose that you were still like in the midst of development on                      |
| 12:02      | it. Is it now it's available again so I can start using it?                                               |
| 12:05      | Yeah, yeah, it is available and it's on the App Store. But as I mentioned, you know, it                   |
| 12:10      | doesn't work perfectly right now, depending on your iPhone usage. There's a weird iOS bug                 |
| 12:14      | in there that I'm trying to figure out. It keeps killing the app in the background, unfortunately.        |
| 12:19      | But it is available and it works pretty well. And it lets you do everything through your                  |
| 12:25      | iPhone so I don't actually have your calendar data on the server. I just have your availability           |
| 12:30      | on the server, which is one of the reasons why I like it.                                                 |
| 12:33      | Okay. So first of all, I'm not using doodle anymore. I'm using Rose's product and second                  |
| 12:39      | of all...                                                                                                 |
| 12:40      | I'm using it differently because if you want multiple people to choose a time that's available            |
| 12:44      | for you, then that's available for everybody, then something like WhenWorks is going to work               |
| 12:49      | much better. Whereas if you are somebody and you want to let people book time with you                    |
| 12:53      | based on criteria you've set up, then WhenWorks is going to be the right solution or Calendly              |
| 12:58      | or one of the other competitors. They're all good.                                                        |
| 13:01      | All right. Well, as soon as you get the bugs ironed out, I expect you to tell us on the                   |
| 13:04      | show, Rose. So all of us can start using it.                                                              |
| 13:07      | Yeah, I will do. I'm hoping that I can get that out in October sometime, but we'll see.                   |
| 13:12      | I'm not making any promises just yet.                                                                     |
| 13:14      | Yeah. I get it. I get it. It's tough, sister. It's tough.                                                 |
| 13:19      | It is.                                                                                                    |
| 13:20      | All right. So we've got a variety of services, though, that can help you pick a time for                  |
| 13:25      | the meeting. And then when you set the meeting, I like to also use some of the integrations               |
| 13:33      | for some of these online services. Like Zoom has a great integration. A lot of calendar                   |
| 13:38      | apps work with it. The one I use the most is Fantastical. And Fantastical, you can literally              |
| 13:42      | set the Zoom meeting in the Fantastical event. And then so once you set it, you send it out               |
| 13:47      | to everybody. It's got the Zoom stuff attached to it and you're done.                                     |
| 13:50      | Yes. Yeah. That's great. And I really like doing that. You can, of course, also just                      |
| 13:56      | create an invite or a meeting inside of Zoom and have it add to your calendar, which works                |
| 14:02      | too. But I would definitely recommend inviting people to the calendar event because or sending            |
| 14:08      | them the calendar event file, because it's surprising how many people will then forget                    |
| 14:13      | to put something in their calendar and then double book themselves. Whereas if you send                   |
| 14:18      | them the actual invite through the calendar system, then it pops up in their calendar                     |
| 14:22      | and blocks them off. So they know that they are busy talking to you then.                                 |
| 14:28      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by The Uptake, a new show on all things tech                 |
| 14:32      | and community from Microsoft. If you're looking for a new show to listen to, The Uptake covers            |
| 14:37      | topics in the world of tech, as well as how to use on professional learning, development                  |
| 14:41      | and community building. Each episode features members of the tech community. The conversations            |
| 14:46      | are pretty fun. And each show has a focus topic, guest interviews, local and global                       |
| 14:50      | community news, plus updates on event conferences and more. And just so you have an idea of               |
| 14:56      | what to expect, I want to tell you about some of the topics you might be interested in                    |
| 14:59      | that were on previous episodes. They've talked about personal and career growth along with                |
| 15:04      | imposter syndRoam and a topic they call less code, more power.                                            |
| 15:09      | I listened to an episode on sketch noting and what really struck me is how obviously                      |
| 15:14      | everybody involved had actually tried sketch noting and how they compared it to their regular             |
| 15:19      | experiences of taking notes. As someone who is a copious note taker but has always wanted                 |
| 15:23      | to try sketch notes, it was really helpful to give me that perspective that I needed.                     |
| 15:28      | Go ahead and listen to it now. Just search for The Uptake wherever you get your podcasts.                 |
| 15:33      | That's U-P-T-A-K-E. Or just click the link in the show notes. Go check it out. Our thanks                 |
| 15:39      | to The Uptake and Microsoft for their support of the show and all of Relay FM.                           |
| 15:44      | All right, Rose, we're still talking about getting ready for the meeting and we haven't                   |
| 15:49      | even mentioned shortcuts. How could we not do that?                                                       |
| 15:52      | I know, but at the same time, shortcuts is a great tool, but the key thing that for me,                   |
| 15:57      | it's messing with the actual calendar event creation is invitees. So if I create a calendar               |
| 16:03      | event, I can't invite you to it. Now, of course, for automators, we share a calendar, which               |
| 16:07      | is another great automation tip because then you don't have to make sure the other person                 |
| 16:11      | adds things to their calendar. You just put things in, hopefully, the right calendar,                     |
| 16:15      | and then the other person knows about it. Now, the right calendar part is something that                  |
| 16:19      | both David and I have managed to mess up a few times. I was looking for, I think it                       |
| 16:24      | was this particular episode and you said it was in the focus calendar. So that's an easy                  |
| 16:29      | mistake to make, but so if you are sharing a calendar, shortcuts is a great way to just                   |
| 16:35      | say, hey, it's going to be this episode number. The topic is this and we're recording, you                |
| 16:41      | know, Thursday at 7pm my time, and then it drops it into the automators calendar. That's                  |
| 16:46      | how I do it. And then boom, we're done. But there are plenty of other ways to use shortcuts               |
| 16:51      | with meeting prep.                                                                                        |
| 16:52      | Yeah. I mean, one of the things I like to do with it and back when I worked in a firm                     |
| 16:57      | and I had a bunch of people I worked with on a regular basis, I had automation and this                   |
| 17:03      | was actually before shortcuts. So I had to do it differently, but I would, today I would                  |
| 17:07      | use shortcuts automation where you can prep emails and notifications to people. One of                    |
| 17:14      | the most important things I think you can do with automation before a meeting is automate                 |
| 17:18      | meeting prep.                                                                                             |
| 17:20      | And we just did an episode on document preparation or document automation. And I think a key document     |
| 17:26      | that would be great for automation would be a meeting agenda because they're so often                     |
| 17:31      | they've got a lot of the same things. They've got the date, the time, the title is meeting                |
| 17:36      | agenda. You've got some agenda items, which are going to change. But the end, I always                    |
| 17:40      | have on every agenda that I make action items at the bottom with a line for who's responsible             |
| 17:45      | for each action item. So you could, you could script that out very easily in shortcuts.                   |
| 17:51      | You could script it on the Mac with a [[Keyboard Maestro]] or you can make a TextExpander snippet            |
| 17:57      | that fills it all in for you in an email. But there's just so, so many of the greatest                    |
| 18:02      | hits of automators would be useful for making that agenda. And then with shortcuts, you                   |
| 18:09      | could have an email prepared that's already addressed to the team members. And you could                  |
| 18:14      | write the agenda items into a, like a text field in shortcuts and do the same thing,                      |
| 18:20      | just do variable substitution. I mean, there's like, like, it seems like there's a thousand               |
| 18:25      | ways you could do this, but all of them involve automation.                                               |
| 18:28      | Yes. Actually, the episode we have with Scotty Jackson, he mentioned one of his shortcuts                 |
| 18:32      | is actually a meeting preparation shortcut. And it pulls tasks out of OmniFocus with the                  |
| 18:38      | tag for the person that he's having the meeting with, which I think is a great way of doing               |
| 18:42      | things. If you've got OmniFocus and you've set things up to do that, I think he said                      |
| 18:46      | he was using [[Data Jar]] to store the tag in OmniFocus for that. You know, that's one way of doing            |
| 18:52      | it. Another way could be using [[Drafts]]. I often know I've got meetings coming up and I just                |
| 18:58      | store things that we, that I think we ought to talk about there in [[Drafts]] so that I can                   |
| 19:03      | just pull up that draft A in the meeting, but also before the meeting and just email                      |
| 19:08      | it to everybody so that, you know, people aren't blindsided by these topics in a meeting                  |
| 19:12      | and going, well, I don't know, I'm going to think about that, which is one of the reasons                 |
| 19:17      | why this is great. It's also great because people forget about meetings and it lets them                  |
| 19:21      | put it back in their calendar or say, actually, we can't do a meeting. How about an email?                |
| 19:26      | I can do this in an email, which goes back to your favourite thing, David, of avoiding                     |
| 19:30      | meetings.                                                                                                 |
| 19:31      | Yeah, we've got that in the outline. You know, let's use automation to avoid the meeting                  |
| 19:35      | altogether. We're going to get to that at the end. Yeah. One of the things I would consider               |
| 19:39      | adding to that template and this, I don't know if this is automation advice, but life                     |
| 19:43      | advice is, again, just like I hijacked the noodle, I also hijacked the agenda when I                      |
| 19:49      | get invited because nobody ever distributes them. So, if I've got enough authority in                     |
| 19:55      | the meeting that I can, I will put together an agenda and I'll email it out to everyone                   |
| 20:00      | like a week in advance and I will also put in there a couple, there's two things I always                 |
| 20:05      | do. I say, here's the agenda. If you have anything you want to add, let me know before                    |
| 20:09      | the meeting, the magic word before the meeting. Yes. And so often that's enough to keep people            |
| 20:16      | from adding things at the meeting, which is not what you want. The other thing I do is                    |
| 20:22      | I have a time and the common idea as well, a meeting is going to be 30 minutes, one hour                  |
| 20:29      | or two hours. And why? Why is it always one of those three time increments? Because usually               |
| 20:36      | it's not. So, I actually have a blank fill in line where I say, I anticipate the meeting                  |
| 20:43      | will take 20 minutes. Or I anticipate the meeting will take 10 minutes. And the other                     |
| 20:48      | thing I can do is I can put in there to say, the meeting will end at 10, 20 a.m. and just                 |
| 20:54      | like write it in there in the announcement email. And that way everybody can feel free                    |
| 21:00      | to make appointments at 10.30 and it's fine. And that's just stuff you can do all with                    |
| 21:07      | your automation and your script because you'll forget to do it otherwise. And the other advantage         |
| 21:13      | of that is putting that out in advance. First of all, it shows that you're on top of things.              |
| 21:18      | But two, it kind of sets the tone for the meeting that we're here to get the business                     |
| 21:22      | done. And it's fun to talk about non-business stuff, but let's do that some other time when               |
| 21:28      | everybody isn't being paid to sit around and do nothing.                                                  |
| 21:32      | Yes, definitely. The other thing that I would mention on that, David, is you said that the                |
| 21:37      | anticipated meeting will take 20 minutes. I tend to book meeting appointments for longer                  |
| 21:42      | than I think we need. Not by a huge amount. I won't book a three hour meeting for something               |
| 21:47      | I think can be done in 30 minutes. But I will book 45 minute meeting for something that                   |
| 21:52      | I think needs 30. And the reason for this is people are late because they have back-to-back               |
| 21:56      | meetings. And if you finish early, people are usually happy that they actually have time                  |
| 22:01      | to go to the bathroom and deal with stuff before the next time. So I tend to overestimate                 |
| 22:07      | on that and just say, I think it's going to take about 45 minutes. And then if we finish                  |
| 22:11      | in 30 minutes, people are really unhappy about finishing early. This of course depends massively          |
| 22:16      | on your work environment. But I know that in my job where people have just got constant                   |
| 22:20      | back-to-back meetings, finishing early is seen as a wonderful and amazing thing and                       |
| 22:24      | has made me many, many friends.                                                                           |
| 22:27      | Something occurs to me that I've been doing for a long time that I should have been automating            |
| 22:34      | in relation to meetings is often I will also schedule prep time for meetings. If I'm going                |
| 22:40      | to meet someone, I like to be prepared. You know, you don't want to show up and seem like                 |
| 22:44      | a bozo. So when I'm doing my Sunday week planning, I look at my meetings on schedule                      |
| 22:50      | for the week and not, this is the problem. I've never automated. It's not all of them,                    |
| 22:55      | but some of them I will prep planning time. Some of my meetings, I can show up without                    |
| 23:01      | prep and still not look like a bozo. So it just depends on what the content of the meeting                |
| 23:06      | is. So as I'm looking at my week calendar on Sunday, I'll go through and just drag in                     |
| 23:10      | a half hour, an hour sometimes in advance to get everything ready for whatever the meeting                |
| 23:16      | is going to be. But I should be able to automate that. And I'm just kind of thinking out loud             |
| 23:20      | here. I would probably do it on the shortcuts and I would just have it search for calendar                |
| 23:27      | events in the next week and certain calendars because they're only in certain calendars                   |
| 23:31      | that I need to prep like the legal calendar and the MacSparky calendar. And then I would                 |
| 23:36      | say if it contains the word meeting, then I would probably have it ask me, do you want                    |
| 23:41      | prep time and how much? I don't know if it would actually be faster than the way I currently              |
| 23:47      | do it of just manually dragging in. But as an automator, I probably would have to try                     |
| 23:51      | it anyway just to see how it works.                                                                       |
| 23:53      | I would personally, so I have a shortcut that I run on Fridays and it pulls a list of my                  |
| 23:58      | meetings for the next week and helps me send out like a little prep email like, hey, these                |
| 24:04      | people are invited. Is everybody still good for this meeting at this time? Just talk about                |
| 24:09      | this. And this I then copy paste from wherever. Usually [[Drafts]] sometimes are internal wiki.               |
| 24:16      | But what you could do because I have it present a list of those calendar items to me because              |
| 24:21      | it pulls them in. And then I take off the ones that I want to send the email for, you                     |
| 24:26      | could pull in the list of calendar items and just check off the ones that you want to do                  |
| 24:29      | prep for. It could subtract 30 minutes from the start of the meeting and then just add                    |
| 24:34      | a 30 minute event for each of those. And okay, you might have to manually move some of them               |
| 24:38      | around because, you know, if you do have almost back to back or back to back things, you may              |
| 24:42      | not have the 30 minutes in between. You can maybe prep some stuff the day before. But,                    |
| 24:47      | you know, once it's in your calendar, then that's easy because that's how I do time blocking.             |
| 24:51      | I just have it done a whole bunch of events into my calendar on Monday at 5pm. And then                   |
| 24:55      | I drag things around to move because, you know, there's no such thing as a perfect                        |
| 25:00      | automation when it comes to time blocking because my week, every week is different.                       |
| 25:05      | And in two weeks, I'm moving. So my week is going to be very different for a couple of                    |
| 25:09      | weeks. Yeah, I've been just to go down that tangent                                                       |
| 25:12      | a little bit. I've been experimenting with both doing it as shortcut and doing it as                      |
| 25:18      | just a recurring event, you know, and the recurring event is kind of nice because then                    |
| 25:23      | I look in, you know, three months, I still kind of know what I want to be doing on most                   |
| 25:27      | days of the week. And then that's my default behaviour. I've got to like have a reason not                 |
| 25:32      | to. The downside is that dreaded confirmation dialogue box. Whenever you have a recurring                 |
| 25:38      | event and you move it, change the length, do anything to the event, you have to say,                      |
| 25:43      | do you want to change everyone in the future or just this one? I wish there was a way to                  |
| 25:48      | say, you know, don't, you know, don't ask me that. Just always make it a one time thing.                  |
| 25:54      | You know, make me go in somehow into the event editor or something to change it permanently.              |
| 25:59      | But so I hate that confirmation dialogue box. So I can't make up my mind whether it's easier              |
| 26:05      | to do that with like a shortcut that just dumps them in or instead just make recurring                    |
| 26:12      | events. I honestly still struggle with that. Yeah, I've gone with most things are a shortcut              |
| 26:18      | that are in a shortcut, but there are some things that I struggle to calculate. So for                    |
| 26:25      | example, we take interns to release the automators episodes. So every four weeks in my calendar,          |
| 26:29      | I have a time block recurring to prep and release automators. But I move this around                      |
| 26:34      | pretty much every single time because it, you know, it's in there as a block that needs                   |
| 26:39      | to happen on the Friday. But sometimes I do most of it on the Thursday and then a little                  |
| 26:42      | bit on the Friday just to make sure everything's done and out the door on time. It varies.                |
| 26:47      | So that confirmation dialogue does drive me slightly insane. But I like having it in                      |
| 26:53      | there as a little, you know, like, Oh, yeah, don't forget, really, don't forget, this has                 |
| 26:56      | to be done.                                                                                               |
| 26:57      | All right. So I just want to go back to your shortcut where you're pulling meetings for                   |
| 27:03      | the next week. And so it's preparing an email. How is it deciding where those emails get                  |
| 27:09      | sent?                                                                                                     |
| 27:10      | The invitee. So even though in shortcuts, you can't invite people to an event with an                     |
| 27:16      | event, the with the create calendar event action, you can get the details of a calendar                   |
| 27:22      | event. And you can then get the invitees, I think it's called invitees, get details                       |
| 27:27      | of event attendees, that's the action. And then you can get their name from it. And yeah,                 |
| 27:36      | you can figure it out from there. It's not perfect. I have it then look things up in                      |
| 27:40      | my contacts. And I do have to sync my exchange contacts to my phone for that for work stuff               |
| 27:46      | and for everything else. It tries to look things up. And as I said, it's not perfect,                     |
| 27:52      | but it's pretty good. And it creates a whole bunch of draft emails for me, which I then                   |
| 27:55      | go through a manually double check. I don't have it automatically send anything because                   |
| 28:01      | there have been some hilarious bloopers in that where I've pasted the wrong agenda.                       |
| 28:05      | So yeah,                                                                                                  |
| 28:06      | I'm going to follow up on this Rose. I think this is something I want to do, but I want                   |
| 28:11      | to address the meeting prep time and the also another calendar event I sometimes create                   |
| 28:16      | is a post meeting time. Like if it's an important meeting, I actually will schedule myself time           |
| 28:21      | afterwards to go back to my desk and kind of make sense of what just happened. And like                   |
| 28:27      | sometimes if I took on a bunch of responsibility, get it like into OmniFocus and to my systems.           |
| 28:33      | So I, you know, don't drop the ball. So maybe what I need to do is make a kind of a big                   |
| 28:40      | shortcut that looks at the meetings and gives me multiple options and confirmation emails.                |
| 28:45      | So I don't know gang that I'm going to have that out by the time the show publishes because               |
| 28:49      | that's going to take a little while. And I am super busy right now, but just keep an                      |
| 28:54      | eye on the, um, the MacSparky blog and I'll go, I'll post it in the automators forum once                |
| 29:00      | I get it done. You've inspired me. I think I, I think I could go some automation steps                    |
| 29:07      | with this and make it better.                                                                             |
| 29:09      | Yeah. There's definitely a lot that you can automate with this and you can go nuts with                   |
| 29:14      | it and go crazy, or you can keep it super simple. I have different shortcuts for different                |
| 29:20      | kinds of meetings. So for example, I have one for all my work stuff and then one for                      |
| 29:24      | my personal stuff, because prepping for automators and stuff is something that's going to happen          |
| 29:28      | for every single automators episode. Same with nested folders and with any other podcast                  |
| 29:33      | I need to be on, I will, you know, have a prep time dumped in my calendar. Um, and I                      |
| 29:39      | don't send confirmation emails to double check with, with you and with Scotty and with whoever            |
| 29:43      | else is hosting for, for these events, because, uh, they, they will, you know, if something's             |
| 29:49      | up, then you're going to set, send me a message and go, Hey, I've got a problem. Um, and,                 |
| 29:54      | uh, so yeah.                                                                                              |
| 29:55      | So let's use that as an example. So automators, we have a format of our calendar event.                   |
| 30:00      | Yeah. Well, it's also in a specific calendar and it's not an all day event. So for, for                   |
| 30:06      | me that's easy and it's the exact same thing with nested folders. It just looks for an                    |
| 30:10      | event that is not an all day event in either of those calendars and adds prep time beforehand.            |
| 30:16      | And then it just, it, it schedules you a prep time. Like, like you, I do, I schedule prep                 |
| 30:20      | time too, but I do it on my max parking calendar, not on the automators calendar because you              |
| 30:24      | don't need to see.                                                                                        |
| 30:25      | Well, I don't, I don't, I don't put it in the automators calendar. I dump it in my,                       |
| 30:29      | in my time blocking calendar. Um,                                                                         |
| 30:31      | Yes. That's what I mean.                                                                                  |
| 30:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 30:33      | It checks based on the calendar that the event is in what kind of prep it is that I need                  |
| 30:36      | to do.                                                                                                    |
| 30:37      | Yeah. But like, for instance, if it sees an, a automators event that's not an all day event,              |
| 30:43      | then in the Rose calendar, not the automators calendar, it will set a prep time an hour                   |
| 30:48      | in advance, I assume, or something like that.                                                             |
| 30:50      | I usually have it put an hour in the day before just because if there are any automations                 |
| 30:54      | I want to create or dig out or modify for the outline, um, then I can go ahead and take                   |
| 31:00      | a look at those. Um, I make sure, um, and doing it right beforehand, uh, is tricky, especially            |
| 31:06      | with the whole eating thing, because we usually record shortly after dinner for me.                       |
| 31:09      | Now, if you are not fortunate enough to have a calendar that rarely has a non all day event               |
| 31:16      | in it. So, uh, you're at work and your work calendar has a bunch of events in it. I think                 |
| 31:21      | what I would do with shortcuts, it would be easy enough to look for events in a certain                   |
| 31:26      | calendar that have a key phrase in them. And you know, it would be something like meeting                 |
| 31:31      | the word meeting, right? And then you could have it automatically, uh, in addition to                     |
| 31:36      | sending out confirmation email schedule prep time for you. Yeah. We're kind of talking                    |
| 31:40      | in a circle here. We're getting back to that thing I want to make, but the, um, but yeah,                 |
| 31:44      | this is totally doable and something that's very automation friendly, I think.                            |
| 31:48      | Definitely. So there's another thing that we talked about. You briefly touched upon                       |
| 31:53      | this, David, with the following up after a meeting and you actually have a shortcut for                   |
| 31:57      | this, which I've stolen and I'm using, which is I take my meeting notes in [[Drafts]], um,                    |
| 32:02      | because I love [[Drafts]]. It's very simple and easy to capture things, but you could do this                 |
| 32:05      | with pretty much anything. Um, and I have this action, which I stole from you, um, that                   |
| 32:11      | goes through and pulls out all of the tasks at the end of a meeting so that I can put                     |
| 32:15      | them in OmniFocus and process them. Um, and one of the other things that I'm looking at                   |
| 32:20      | doing is modifying this and adding waiting on actions for things that are assigned to                     |
| 32:24      | people other than myself. So that I know that say, for example, I'm waiting for David to                  |
| 32:28      | get back to me on our super secret members only episode, which will be out next month.                    |
| 32:33      | Yeah. Yeah. And that's just the Java script. It's in the, I'm running out of [[Drafts]], anything             |
| 32:38      | with a dash in front of it gets added to the OmniFocus inbox. You could also, um, another                 |
| 32:45      | way you could automate this is with "regex", regular expressions. You could, um, if you                      |
| 32:50      | have like people's names in it, you could do a regex search for their names and then                      |
| 32:57      | you could send emails to them with the parts that are important to them, or even just a                   |
| 33:02      | copy of the agenda or the meeting minutes to them. Yes. I actually covered that in the                    |
| 33:07      | shortcuts field. God, I built a regex expression to do that. And the trick, you know, the easy            |
| 33:12      | trick for that is generally it's only a certain group of people that you're meeting with.                 |
| 33:17      | So it's easy to, you know, to match a name to an email address in the shortcut itself.                    |
| 33:22      | Yeah. Definitely. Well, while you're in the meeting, that's one place we're not really                    |
| 33:26      | talking much automation, but you know, your usual bag of tricks, you know, TextExpander                  |
| 33:31      | is your friend. Yeah. I've, I've been experimenting with trying to automatically enable do not            |
| 33:37      | disturb on my Mac. Uh, but I found it can be a bit finicky to do. If you just alt and                     |
| 33:42      | then click on the control centre icon on Mac OS, then it will enable do not disturb. It's                 |
| 33:46      | easy to automate that on iOS. Um, and, uh, you know, just have a shortcut that you run                    |
| 33:51      | at the start of a meeting that'll create your, your, your notes and, uh, enable do not disturb.           |
| 33:57      | And similarly at the end of the meeting to say, Hey, don't forget to check on things                      |
| 33:59      | you need to follow up on, but, uh, Mac OS is a bit tricky over.                                           |
| 34:03      | Another shortcut that just occurs to me as I'm sitting here, it would be to just run                      |
| 34:08      | a beginning of a meeting shortcut on your phone where it, it queries, you know, what's                    |
| 34:14      | the estimated length and it turns on do not disturb. And it starts running a timer in                     |
| 34:20      | the background. Maybe it pops up on alert when you're five minutes, you know, from                        |
| 34:24      | the end. So you can kind of remind people to start wrapping things up. Yeah. There,                       |
| 34:29      | you could do some, you could use some automation during the meeting. Although to be honest,               |
| 34:33      | I, I just don't, I don't find I need that because I'm looking at the clock anyway.                        |
| 34:37      | Yeah. Same, same for me. I, I tend to just do things. There are little automations I                      |
| 34:42      | do. Sometimes, you know, like to, to reformat stuff and, and things like that using in                    |
| 34:46      | my case, predominantly draw sections, but right click on Mac and you have text transformation,            |
| 34:51      | which is great if you need to change the case of something.                                               |
| 34:53      | Yeah. One of the things for me is almost all of the automation related to meetings is                     |
| 34:57      | iOS based because so often the iPad is my meeting tool. Yeah. I like having the pencil,                   |
| 35:04      | I can draw pictures of things. If we start discussing something and I think the iPad                      |
| 35:09      | is much less, you know, intrusive when you're sitting in a room with other people, at least               |
| 35:15      | if we ever do that again, but even zoom meetings and stuff. I really like having my iOS device            |
| 35:21      | with me when I participate in those meetings.                                                             |
| 35:24      | Same. I've been doing meetings almost exclusively on the actual iOS device using my Mac then              |
| 35:29      | for, you know, like checking code and other things.                                                       |
| 35:32      | Yeah. Makes sense. This episode of the automators is brought to you by Mint Mobile. Go to mintmobile.com. |
| 35:39      |/automators and cut your wireless bill to $15 a month.                                               |
| 35:44      | Mint Mobile are the folks that can cut your wireless bill to $15 a month with their futuristic            |
| 35:48      | approach to wireless. I have a Mint Mobile card. I was sent one and I'm really enjoying                   |
| 35:54      | it. In fact, so much so that I have got myself an Android phone. That's right. I'm living                 |
| 36:00      | on the other side of the fence with this Mint Mobile card and it is working great. It was                 |
| 36:05      | very easy to set up, pop it in, activation took no time at all. Network coverage is great.                |
| 36:10      | I mean, I've been to the extent I've been moving around. I've been taking it around                       |
| 36:14      | with me. I've never lost coverage. It's been working great.                                               |
| 36:17      | And there's some things about Android we're going to talk about sometime on the automators,               |
| 36:21      | but Mint Mobile is what enabled me to do that. And it just costs $15 a month with my existing             |
| 36:28      | carrier for my iPhone $15 a month doesn't even get me in the door. So Mint Mobile is great                |
| 36:35      | for that. If you're still using one of the big wireless providers this year, have you                     |
| 36:39      | asked yourself what you're paying for between expensive retail stores, inflated prices and                |
| 36:44      | hidden fees. There's ample opportunity to take advantage of paying customers like you.                    |

| 37:57      | Okay, David, so we teased this earlier a little bit. Your favourite way to automate meetings               |
| 38:03      | is to entirely avoid meetings. Is that correct?                                                           |
| 38:06      | Yeah, well, I mean, meetings can serve a purpose. They're synchronous communications                      |
| 38:11      | about a problem. That's what they are. You need everybody in a room, but the problem                      |
| 38:15      | with it is the cost of it. Everybody, there's a cost to everyone's time, and when you have                |
| 38:20      | a meeting, it scales exponentially depending on how many people you have in the room.                     |
| 38:26      | The question I always ask myself is, does it need to be synchronous communication? Basecamp               |
| 38:32      | has a great feature where you have these messages and people can do check-ins on a message,               |
| 38:39      | which is what a lot of people often do in meetings. They have a meeting about Project                     |
| 38:43      | X and they go around the table and then Mark says what he's doing and then Jane says what                 |
| 38:48      | she's doing and you go around and everybody listens to everybody else. And sometimes you                  |
| 38:52      | need that because you need to give each other feedback, but a lot of times it's just informational        |
| 38:57      | and everybody's sitting there listening to this stuff as they go around the table and                     |
| 39:01      | it just spins out of control. With check-ins, you could do that digitally. People could                   |
| 39:08      | just check in on a message board and everybody could get the same information without having              |
| 39:13      | to carve time out of their day for a meeting. Basecamp's a great way to do this, but I got                |
| 39:19      | thinking, well, as automators, how would we do this as automators if we didn't have Basecamp?             |
| 39:23      | Oh, there are so many ways I could do this. My first instinct would be if this is a weekly                |
| 39:28      | thing that you need people to do, Zapier or IntegRoamt, actually both of them great tools,                |
| 39:33      | they can automatically run on a schedule and they can create a document wherever you like,                |
| 39:38      | so they can usually connect to wiki pages, Quip, Google Docs, all of those things. They                   |
| 39:43      | can just generate it and put it stamp in the date and time or just the date and whatever                  |
| 39:49      | title it is you want and then send it off as an email and say, hey, can everyone just                     |
| 39:54      | quickly put in their update on this? It could also do it with Basecamp as well. There's                   |
| 40:00      | tons of ways to do that. I think it was Shortcutify for iOS is the one with the Google Doc                |
| 40:08      | API in it, but don't quote me on that because I'm struggling to remember if it was that                   |
| 40:13      | app or if it was another shortcuts app. It is Shortcutify, but they only have Google Drive                |
| 40:19      | integration.                                                                                              |
| 40:20      | Yeah, I do think you want a, this is not an automation where you generate an email and                    |
| 40:25      | send it out to the whole team because that just generates a lot of emails and it doesn't                  |
| 40:30      | keep the information in one place. You want a like a centralised document that everybody                  |
| 40:35      | can work on. And that's why Quip and Google Docs really come to mind as good resources                    |
| 40:41      | for this. You could even automate, like you could have one Google document for the whole                  |
| 40:45      | Project X and then you could automate as the person coordinating it. You could automate                   |
| 40:52      | an entry every week that goes in and sets a new page or a new like heading one. And                       |
| 40:58      | then you could automate sending an email with the link to the same document say, okay guys,               |
| 41:02      | time for a check in on Project X, please, you know, log into Google Doc and update us.                    |
| 41:06      | Yeah. And you could even go further. We talked about this a little bit last week. Zapier                  |
| 41:11      | has a ability to convert markdown HTML, but you could also just do this in HTML as well                   |
| 41:17      | as adding the heading. You could even add a little table in there, you know, two columns.                 |
| 41:21      | First column has everybody's names in it. One wrote, one wrote her name. And then the                     |
| 41:25      | next one is just space for their update. So, you know, it's really obvious who's written                  |
| 41:29      | their update and who hasn't written their update at a very quick glance. And it also encourages           |
| 41:34      | people to be concise, which is, you know, of course, really great if you do just want                     |
| 41:39      | an update. I've seen a lot of time get wasted with unnecessary status update meetings. My                 |
| 41:45      | favourite one, we had 16 people in an hour and a half meeting at work, which was I believe                 |
| 41:50      | three and a half days of people time, because we just needed to talk about whether or not                 |
| 41:57      | people were doing things. It's like, you could have done that with an email.                              |
| 42:01      | I was in a, I don't, I didn't, I never did a lot. I represent a lot of construction                       |
| 42:06      | companies, but I never did a lot of what they call construction defect law, which is where                |
| 42:11      | like there's a housing project in the roof leaks. And then they sue everybody. They sue                   |
| 42:16      | the guy who made the roof. They sue the guy who put the wood up. They sue the guy who                     |
| 42:19      | installed the mini blinds. And I would go to these meetings on the rare occasion I was                    |
| 42:24      | involved with that litigation and there'd be like 40 attorneys in the room and they're                    |
| 42:29      | all charging hundreds of dollars an hour. That's just money being set on fire, basically.                 |
| 42:35      | What is the gross national product being wasted in this room where something like a Google                |
| 42:41      | doc or a base camp status update would have solved that problem and taken everybody 10                    |
| 42:46      | minutes. So it's just, it is crazy. So give some thought to that.                                         |
| 42:52      | So most of those lawyers wouldn't have invoiced for 10 minutes. If it had been 10 minutes,                |
| 42:55      | they'd have invoiced for an hour, right? You know what most lawyers are, I don't think                    |
| 43:00      | lawyer, I wouldn't and I know most of the lawyers I know wouldn't do that. They would                     |
| 43:03      | just charge their time. So obviously you're what, you're what the good guys, David.                       |
| 43:08      | Yeah, but the, either way, I do think that, that like giving thought to avoiding meetings                 |
| 43:15      | with automation tools is something that everybody should do. And for me, the base camp tools              |
| 43:20      | are real eye-opener because I've used base camp now in a couple different teams. And                      |
| 43:25      | I find that it does allow you to avoid meetings with a tool like that.                                    |
| 43:29      | Yes. Yeah, it really can. So exploring other tools, which either are automation friendly                  |
| 43:35      | or are automation tools in and of themselves to avoid stuff like this is definitely a great               |
| 43:40      | way of, you know, skipping the meeting, giving yourself a little bit more free time, even                 |
| 43:44      | if it's just so you can enjoy a coffee in the morning.                                                    |
| 43:47      | Amen. Ask the automators. We had someone right in, Michael. He says, I have a recurring task              |
| 43:55      | every three days and [[Apple Reminders]]. Can shortcuts easily move the task to and from                      |
| 44:00      | my list to do and today? He says, I'm thinking I'd like to run it at 11.50 PM. This gives                 |
| 44:07      | me time to appreciate my day's achievements today and see my new tasks in the morning.                    |
| 44:13      | And so the problem he has is he's got an irregular recurring event and he's trying to figure out          |
| 44:19      | how to automate it. Yeah. And, you know, there's quite a few different ways that you can look             |
| 44:24      | at this. I'm going to start by saying, okay, so if we look inside of [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] and we actually            |
| 44:31      | just create a task, which I'm doing right now live on air because I like to test these                    |
| 44:36      | things in real time to make sure it's still working. And if you'd just go in and then                     |
| 44:42      | you can actually, there we go, date, and then you can add your time and there we go. And                  |
| 44:47      | now it's done. So I have a due task now, but when this repeats, you can set a custom repeat               |
| 44:54      | to every three days. So that's doable. So we actually have the task repeating all the                     |
| 45:00      | time. Now we don't know if it is just this task that Michael wants to move, or if it's                    |
| 45:05      | all of his tasks. I'm going to assume it's just this one, but if it's one task, then                      |
| 45:09      | the name should remain the same. Right, David? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So I'm not going insane                  |
| 45:15      | here. That's a good start. Yeah. So just built on the repeating task. And, and there's nothing            |
| 45:19      | wrong with just having like the, when he used the word, I want to move the task to and from               |
| 45:25      | my list. I got thinking, does he mean he wants to uncheck it and then see it again? I mean,               |
| 45:30      | I wouldn't do that. I would just create the task again with the same name every three                     |
| 45:34      | days. But I think that's probably what he meant by the question. Well, what I understood                  |
| 45:40      | is once it's been checked off. So when it's in to do, then it's not yet due to be done                    |
| 45:46      | today. Okay. So it's in to do for two days, and then it moves over into the today view.                   |
| 45:51      | And he doesn't want it in the today list most of the time, because it's not something he                  |
| 45:55      | needs to do today, which makes perfect sense. And then once it's checked off, he wants it                 |
| 46:00      | to move back. So you could, I would suggest that you have probably one shortcut for this,                 |
| 46:06      | which looks for the task with the specific name inside of the to do list. And if it finds                 |
| 46:13      | it and it's due tomorrow, let's assume it's running at 1150 at night for now. And if it                   |
| 46:19      | finds it and it's due tomorrow, then it moves it. So the only problem with this is when                   |
| 46:25      | you recreate a, when you move a task with shortcuts, you can't move it, you have to                       |
| 46:31      | delete it and recreate it. And that's where I think things might get a little bit iffy,                   |
| 46:37      | because I'm not 100% certain that when you create a reminder with shortcuts, you can                      |
| 46:41      | set the repeat interval.                                                                                  |
| 46:43      | I can't help but feel like the [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] team, like they did a big job on redesigning [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]]           |
| 46:49      | last year for iOS 13. And the day they were working on shortcuts, there was like, maybe                   |
| 46:54      | it was like a retirement party for somebody or something. And they left early that day.                   |
| 46:59      | And then they just forgot, you know, they never, because [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] as nice as it is                       |
| 47:04      | now, it really needs some support from shortcuts.                                                         |
| 47:09      | Yeah, it does. So I know that there are, there's great support for reminders in the Scriptable            |
| 47:15      | app. And I'm wondering if you can change the list of the reminder with Scriptable. If not,                |
| 47:22      | you will almost certainly be able to create a reminder with a repeat interval inside of                   |
| 47:28      | Scriptable. But of course, the ideal thing would be to just change the list every, you                    |
| 47:33      | know, every three days. So that if it's due within the next, say 24 hours, then it moves                  |
| 47:38      | the today list. If it's not due in the next 24 hours, then it moves to the to do list,                    |
| 47:44      | the general list. But the trick is, is finding the right way to do that. I'm pretty certain               |
| 47:48      | that Scriptable is the right answer here. But that's going to be require running an                       |
| 47:53      | inline script inside of shortcuts. So you can stick inside of shortcuts, you'll just                      |
| 47:56      | need to have the Scriptable app installed as well.                                                        |
| 47:59      | Yeah, I think the other problem with Michael's question is the trigger problem, like he wants             |
| 48:03      | to run it at 1150pm. Now, in a couple months when Apple releases iOS 14, this problem is                  |
| 48:09      | solved because we have a time based trigger that doesn't require confirmation. So in a                    |
| 48:15      | couple months, this will be really easy. Now, however, it's possible, but a little complicated.           |
| 48:21      | How would you solve it before we have time based triggers, Rose?                                          |
| 48:25      | Well, I would suggest that the, the alarm would be a good way to do this, because if                      |
| 48:31      | you look at the alarm trigger inside of shortcuts, to start with, I would definitely create this          |
| 48:36      | as a shortcut and then use the automation to run the shortcut. Because that way you                       |
| 48:40      | can also run it manually if and when you want to. And for testing, it's much easier. But                  |
| 48:45      | if you say when your wake up alarm is stopped, so if you use alarms any other time of the                 |
| 48:51      | day, I know a lot of people do that, then I would specifically choose the wake up alarm                   |
| 48:55      | that's using the bedtime feature in iOS 13 and the sleep feature in iOS 14. But if you                    |
| 49:00      | say when your alarm is stopped, then run your shortcut, then that will run it first thing                 |
| 49:06      | in the morning. And most people use our alarm to wake up. So you're not going to see the                  |
| 49:10      | task before that. And it won't bother you that it's in the list when it's not due today.                  |
| 49:16      | And it's not in a list when it is due today, I would hope. Yeah. So that's the way I would                |
| 49:20      | do that. And you could also potentially attach it to do not disturb when do not disturb is                |
| 49:25      | enabled. But that means if you use do not disturb at any other time, such as while driving,               |
| 49:33      | maybe going to the cinema, should that be a thing again, hopefully at some point in                       |
| 49:36      | the future, there will be films to go watch in the cinema. And the cinemas will be open                   |
| 49:41      | and safe to visit. But, you know, if you're attaching it to a trigger like do not disturb,                |
| 49:46      | then you'll have to decide whether or not you're bothered by it potentially disappearing                  |
| 49:51      | earlier than intended, or wait until iOS 14 comes out. I'm hoping end of September, so                    |
| 49:56      | that's a month away, month of the week, and do it then.                                                   |
| 50:00      | Yeah. So, and if you're going to tie it to an alarm, I think Rosa, but just to make clear,                |
| 50:05      | I would tie it to my wake up alarm. Forget about the 11.50 at night thing. Just when                      |
| 50:09      | your alarm goes off in the morning, it adds the tasks for you. And you could do that today.               |
| 50:15      | But there are just, it's just the moving the tasks and the lack of shortcuts of what that                 |
| 50:18      | makes us a little bit tricky. Yes.                                                                        |
| 50:21      | I understand why you got hung up on this one. Yeah. Yeah. I think that that is the biggest                |
| 50:25      | problem. If I get a chance, I will look and see if I can create a Scriptable script that                  |
| 50:31      | runs in line in shortcuts to actually try and move it, or at least recreate it with                       |
| 50:36      | the three-day reminder. Because the problem is, is if you move it and you create it and                   |
| 50:40      | it's not got the reminder on it, and at some point your shortcut doesn't run, then you're                 |
| 50:46      | not going to have that task anymore because it's going to have been removed by shortcuts,                 |
| 50:51      | which is great, but also not so great because then you don't do your task every three days                |
| 50:55      | anymore. And I'm sure it's important.                                                                     |
| 50:57      | I mean, I'm really happy overall with the iOS 14 shortcuts improvements. I mean, the                      |
| 51:04      | time-based trigger is such, it's changed the way you shortcut in so many ways. And like                   |
| 51:09      | I'm going to do a free update for the shortcuts field guide with a bunch of stuff. I'm sure               |
| 51:13      | Rose will be publishing on it too, but like setting watch faces in the afternoon, like,                   |
| 51:18      | you know, going from the watch that has all the data on it to like a lime green switch                     |
| 51:23      | it to a simple watch face and just literally looking at your wrist reminds you that you                   |
| 51:27      | shouldn't be working anymore. It's great. But I'm a little surprised that [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] didn't                |
| 51:33      | get more love because I thought that was a no-brainer for this year.                                      |
| 51:36      | The only other thing I will say is [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] does have some built-in smart lists and one                  |
| 51:41      | of them is called Today. So I know that Michael has probably got his own personal list for                |
| 51:47      | Today where he puts things on there that need to be done today and they're not necessarily                |
| 51:51      | due, but there is a Today smart list in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]], which hopefully has everything that's due              |
| 51:58      | today on there. So that might be worth looking at as well. There's Today, Scheduled, All,                 |
| 52:03      | and Flagged. And so potentially looking at changing things up to use the smart lists                      |
| 52:08      | instead might be another approach to that.                                                                |

| 53:29      | So Rose, it's time for us to talk about some automation problems we've solved recently,                   |
| 53:34      | and I've got a couple.                                                                                    |
| 53:36      | Okay, I've got some too. I've been creating problems myself, not intentionally, but moving                |
| 53:41      | house apparently is ripe with the possibility for automation. Yeah, well, let's talk about                |
| 53:47      | yours. You've got, you're doing some OmniFocus scripting.                                                 |
| 53:49      | Yeah, I've actually got quite a few OmniFocus scripts that I've created, and then some that               |
| 53:54      | I've just enhanced for moving. And what I'm going to talk about here today is my inbox                    |
| 53:59      | parser. And this basically automates going through some tasks in my inbox and filing                      |
| 54:05      | them automatically for me because there are some things which say, for example, if I'm                    |
| 54:10      | looking at the IKEA website, and I see a lamp that I think that looks amazing. And I also                 |
| 54:14      | spotted that lamp recently on the Philips Hue subreddit with Philips Hue light bulbs                      |
| 54:19      | in and think that's really cool. I added to [[OmniFocus]] to put it on my shopping list of                    |
| 54:24      | things to buy from my new house. And if you use, I'm using a bookmark, but if you use                     |
| 54:30      | the [[Safari]] extension, then it will always add it with the title of the page. And of                       |
| 54:34      | course, this is ripe for automation because it's in the same consistent format every single               |
| 54:39      | time. There's always the IKEA dot com link in the note. And there's always face dash                      |
| 54:44      | base IKEA at the end of the task. And lots of stores do the same sort of thing where                      |
| 54:49      | maybe they've got a pipe before their shop name or something like that. And I actually                    |
| 54:54      | got this idea from [[Joe Buhlig]]. And he had an [[AppleScript\|AppleScript]] still has an AppleScript, where                 |
| 55:01      | it could automatically parse tasks in your inbox using a format called transport text.                    |
| 55:07      | Now transport text predates Taskpaper. And it's not quite as flexible. But it's great                    |
| 55:14      | for adding things by an automated system where you can get it into OmniFocus via the                      |
| 55:19      | mail drop. And so it would start with dash dash and then parse things. So to start with                   |
| 55:24      | I rewrote that script using Omni automation. So it looks and if any task in my inbox starts               |
| 55:29      | with dash dash, then it parses that with transport text and deletes the original task. So it              |
| 55:35      | adds a new task with all of the information and that can be filed completely. And I have                  |
| 55:39      | quite a few things added through Zapier to my OmniFocus through this, you know, things                    |
| 55:46      | like, you know, make sure that I've sent David an update on this automators episode, things               |
| 55:52      | like that. And so then I just added an else if and I could have done a switch statement                   |
| 55:59      | programmers will probably be aware of this a switch statement essentially says, Hey,                      |
| 56:04      | if like, look at this thing, if it matches this case, then do this, if it matches this                    |
| 56:09      | case, then do this, if it matches this case, then do this, I went with if else, if else,                  |
| 56:14      | if not particularly efficient, not particularly pretty, but it's very easy for people to understand       |
| 56:19      | on the scripts actually in the show notes. And then I just looked at the task name and                    |
| 56:24      | if it includes the space desk base IKEA and the note includes the IKEA website, then it                   |
| 56:30      | gets my IKEA tag, it changes the task name and removes that space dash base IKEA from                     |
| 56:35      | the task name, and it adds the IKEA tag. And then I go through and I've got a couple of                   |
| 56:40      | other stores here to show you how it works, including one that's actually got two tags                    |
| 56:44      | that are added to it. And I just go through and at the tasks and then stuff magically                     |
| 56:53      | sort of gets tidied up in my inbox. And it's great because I can go through and go, whoa,                 |
| 56:57      | it's a lot of items to buy an IKEA, just assign them all to the right project and I'm good                |
| 57:02      | to go. And then, yeah, it's saving me a lot of time because I don't accidentally miss                     |
| 57:09      | file things. And then when I was actually in IKEA the other day, I did not miss things                    |
| 57:13      | because they were on the wrong list.                                                                      |
| 57:15      | Yeah, I mean, that makes makes a lot of sense. You know, I would have, you know, when was                 |
| 57:20      | it when you're a carpenter, when you have a hammer, everything's a nail. So, so I would                   |
| 57:26      | have done this with the rather than trying to JavaScript it, I would have just used a                     |
| 57:31      | choose from menu selection. Like if I, because I would, I do all shopping on iOS anyway.                  |
| 57:37      | So if I was on iOS and I hit the share button on a website, what I would do is have a choose              |
| 57:43      | from menu list and then I would have all of my typical locations because with OmniFocus                   |
| 57:49      | input, you can create a separate input for multiple choose from menus. You say IKEA,                      |
| 57:55      | then you have the IKEA task already with, you know, the context and the notes and everything              |
| 58:01      | filled out and then you just put it in. I think your system is a little more elegant,                     |
| 58:06      | but probably took longer to put together.                                                                 |
| 58:08      | It didn't take that long to put together, actually, because if I want to add a new store,                 |
| 58:12      | I can just duplicate, I think it's five lines in total. I just copy and else if, and then                 |
| 58:18      | I add a new store. And also the last store on the list had, it adds both my supermarket                   |
| 58:23      | tag as well as the store name tag. And so that helps because, you know, you can see                       |
| 58:32      | how to do that.                                                                                           |
| 58:33      | And I just like the idea of doing it in JavaScript because then I can just add tons of things.            |
| 58:38      | I usually go through an open 10, 15 pages inside of, you know, [[Safari]] or [[Firefox]] on                       |
| 58:45      | my work machine. If I'm taking a quick break from work, usually like three pages there.                   |
| 58:49      | But then I just add them all. And then when I get to it later on whatever platform I'm                    |
| 58:53      | on, that's why I went with the OmniFocus automation here with the JavaScript scripting. Then I            |
| 58:59      | can just run this and it will just clean up my inbox for me. And it's only if I'm doing                   |
| 59:05      | the create a task with transport text. So that's the things that start with dash dash                     |
| 59:10      | that it will go ahead and actually, you know, potentially put it in a project. Most of the                |
| 59:15      | time it's just adding tags. And I've set my OmniFocus to only clean up my inbox if items                  |
| 59:21      | have a project. So that's how that works for me.                                                          |
| 59:26      | And honestly, this is a very easy to read JavaScript. So if you want to like get better                   |
| 59:32      | at it with OmniFocus, and Rose, you're going to make this available.                                      |
| 59:36      | Yeah, the link is already in the show notes, prepped for everybody.                                       |
| 59:39      | So this is an excellent one to download. Because it's so obvious when you look at it, even                |
| 59:44      | if you're not a JavaScript programmer, you can see how it's very easy. Like, and I love                   |
| 59:48      | the the step of removing the tag text. So you're essentially using names as tags, and                     |
| 59:53      | you remove the tag. Yeah, yeah. Because it's very easy to spot a pattern                                  |
| 59:59      | with things. And the last thing I want to have inside of my my list. Now, I'm not using                   |
| 01:00:05   | good task naming here, I will just have like name of IKEA thing, followed by whatever the                 |
| 01:00:11   | title is of the page, that's, that's my task. And I might add details at the end in brackets,             |
| 01:00:16   | which is why I don't check whether or not the space dash base IKEA is definitely at                       |
| 01:00:20   | the end of the task name. But I don't want space dash base IKEA in there when I've already                |
| 01:00:26   | got the IKEA tag attached to my task, because I'm then filtering in perspectives based on                 |
| 01:00:33   | that information. And I don't need it duplicated.                                                         |
| 01:00:36   | Yeah, nice. But I'm not the only person who's been                                                        |
| 01:00:39   | automating David. You know, always, always, you know, trying                                              |
| 01:00:43   | to find problems you can solve the I've been playing a lot lately with there's a tool called              |
| 01:00:48   | Roam Research, which we're talking about quite a bit over in the focus podcast. And it's                  |
| 01:00:53   | an online note taking app, but it's really a research tool. I mean, it's in the name.                     |
| 01:00:57   | But the if you are reading a lot of things like a lot of academics use it, I'm using                      |
| 01:01:03   | it for some of the stuff I'm doing actually in legal max parking and also just personal                   |
| 01:01:08   | interest research. But the thing I really like about it is it writes                                      |
| 01:01:11   | in Markdown, but they've got some Markdown extensions that allow linking not only of titles               |
| 01:01:18   | of for lack of a better term web pages that you create in Roam Research, because it's                     |
| 01:01:23   | a web tool, but you can link any specific block of text anywhere in it. So like I can                     |
| 01:01:29   | have an article and I can link to a specific paragraph inside that article. It's just                     |
| 01:01:36   | it's very clever. And I don't need to get into it today, but it's something that I've                     |
| 01:01:41   | been writing a lot with. But a lot of things I do, like when I import an article or an                    |
| 01:01:45   | academic paper, I want to read is I want to create a metadata, like sex soon for it.                      |
| 01:01:52   | And it in essence creates an outline so you can have like separate like indents on it.                    |
| 01:01:57   | And so I have metadata where I list the top, the author's name, the publication, the website              |
| 01:02:01   | link and things like that. So I can always go back and get to the other                                   |
| 01:02:05   | pieces of it. And because once I list the author's name, then Roam Research identifies                    |
| 01:02:10   | that author's name anywhere, it shows up in my entire database. So you want to do that.                   |
| 01:02:15   | But to have a uniform system for it, everybody's doing all these crazy systems in Roam Research           |
| 01:02:22   | about how they're going to track their metadata. And for me, it was really simple. I just made            |
| 01:02:25   | a TextExpander, snip it with indents in it. And now it's always exactly the same. I go,                  |
| 01:02:31   | that's automation, but it's very simple automation, but it works. I'm actually there's a problem          |
| 01:02:36   | I need to solve with it because Roam Research sets also up day pages. So you can track your               |
| 01:02:41   | research based on what days you did the research. But they use ordinals in the date. So it doesn't        |
| 01:02:47   | say January 1, 2020, it says January 1, 2020. And so I need to put ordinals and dates and                 |
| 01:02:56   | I want to do that automatically with TextExpander. So I can not only like call up a specific             |
| 01:03:01   | date, but I can put in a code and it'll pick the date two weeks ago, or two weeks from now,               |
| 01:03:06   | and add ordinals. And I know there's a way to do with JavaScript, but I'm not like Rose,                  |
| 01:03:11   | I can't just write it off the top of my head, I actually have to research that one. And it's              |
| 01:03:15   | on my list of things to do, but I haven't got there yet. Another thing I'm automating                     |
| 01:03:21   | is getting texts out of Roam Research. So I talked about how they've got extensions on                    |
| 01:03:26   | markdown. And the way you do these blocks is really simple to link to a an existing title.                |
| 01:03:33   | You use two square brackets on either side. So if I have Rosemary Orchard with two square                 |
| 01:03:38   | brackets around it, that's going to create a web page in my Roam Research database with                   |
| 01:03:43   | Rose's name at the top and a link to every page on which I have listed her name. And                      |
| 01:03:49   | it's great. It's really powerful. But then to link those blocks within it. So and then                    |
| 01:03:55   | if I have a long explanation of something Rose told me how to do, I could link to that                    |
| 01:04:00   | as well with two parentheticals on either side. So I can pull data out of a written                       |
| 01:04:05   | document with parentheticals, I can go to links or tags or whatever you call them with                    |
| 01:04:10   | square brackets. But then when I get something I've written in there and I want to pull it                |
| 01:04:14   | out and use it somewhere else, it's going to have a bunch of square brackets and round                    |
| 01:04:18   | brackets and there's even some curly brackets and other like extensions they've added on                  |
| 01:04:23   | to add the power to the tool that I don't want in my actual document. Yeah. So I export                   |
| 01:04:29   | it out. And I'm obviously not going to go through and hand remove all of that that coding.                |
| 01:04:36   | I could do a search and replace. I mean, this kind of goes back to the stuff we talked about              |
| 01:04:39   | in the last episode. But the way I chose to do it was [[Keyboard Maestro]] has a cool feature,                |
| 01:04:45   | which I really should have mentioned in the last episode, where you can perform search                    |
| 01:04:50   | and replace on text inside the clipboard, which is kind of fun to wrap your head around                   |
| 01:04:56   | because always you think about search and replace is, yeah, okay, I put the text in                       |
| 01:05:01   | [[Drafts]] or in text edit or in Microsoft Word, I put it somewhere on my computer. And then                  |
| 01:05:07   | I do search and replace on it. But what if I did search and replace in memory on the                      |
| 01:05:13   | paste board? It's not even like physically on your screen. Well, that's really easy to                    |
| 01:05:18   | do with [[Drafts]]. There's a there's a command for a search and replace in the clipboard.                    |
| 01:05:22   | So I do that there. So when I copy something out of [[Drafts]], I have a keyboard, sure, could                |
| 01:05:26   | I use it copies the [[Drafts]] text, but then it searches for the square brackets and kill                    |
| 01:05:32   | those and it searches for it just it runs a whole bunch of like little search and replace                 |
| 01:05:37   | routines. And then I move over to whatever document I'm going to write in and I hit paste                 |
| 01:05:42   | and it's magically cleaned for me. And that's kind of a nice little script.                               |
| 01:05:46   | Yeah, that sounds really good. And there's, you know, there's a lot of different ways                     |
| 01:05:50   | you could do that. I'm sure you've considered doing it on iOS with shortcuts as well, right,              |
| 01:05:55   | David? Yeah, I mean, but because Roam is such a web tool, I actually prefer to run it on                  |
| 01:06:01   | my Mac. That's it. I use it almost exclusively on the Mac. So I mean, it does work fine on                |
| 01:06:07   | the iPad, but and I don't use it. There's this whole like cult like personality around                    |
| 01:06:13   | this roadmap where people get into it and they do they want to make it their task manager                 |
| 01:06:17   | and they want to make it their diary. I don't do any of that stuff with it. I just use it                 |
| 01:06:20   | as a research tool. So it's fine. Yeah, the way I've got it.                                              |
| 01:06:24   | Yeah, no, I've seen exactly the same thing with notion, which I've been trying for a                      |
| 01:06:27   | few different things. And there are people doing amazing things with it. And I'm just                     |
| 01:06:31   | there trying to use it for, you know, one particular project where I've got some data                     |
| 01:06:36   | that just needs to be in multiple formats. And I thought, you know, notion might be a                     |
| 01:06:40   | place to try it. I think it's fun as a nerd to look at something                                          |
| 01:06:44   | and try and turn it into an everything tool. But we have this abundance of riches like                    |
| 01:06:50   | OmniFocus is such an amazing task manager. And even though Roam is great, Roam will never                 |
| 01:06:57   | be as good of a task manager as OmniFocus. So why don't I just use OmniFocus or [[Day One]]                   |
| 01:07:03   | is a great journalling tool and it has end-to-end encryption and Roam could be a journalling                |
| 01:07:08   | tool but doesn't have end-to-end encryption. So I'm not sure it makes sense for me to do                  |
| 01:07:12   | it there. And so so that's kind of my thought process. But but it is I am definitely a believer           |
| 01:07:18   | in this this linking that the links are what make it so powerful. And it's something that                 |
| 01:07:23   | I'm going to be using more of as I go forward. But there are limits for me. And but there                 |
| 01:07:28   | are some great automation tools for a web based system. And if you're an automator, you can               |
| 01:07:34   | really save yourself a lot of time. Yeah, definitely. One other automation is going to                    |
| 01:07:39   | mention briefly is I have talked many times on Mac power users in this show about my dislike              |
| 01:07:45   | for the tagging system and iOS, you know, when you go to add tags to an item, it is very                  |
| 01:07:53   | difficult because if you have more than 10, you've got to scroll through a massive list                   |
| 01:07:57   | and hope you don't accidentally hit a tag as you're scrolling. And it's just Apple has                    |
| 01:08:02   | not figured out that we need a search bar when you're applying tags. I don't know. It's                   |
| 01:08:09   | it's it's stunning to me that after like four or five releases of iOS with this problem,                  |
| 01:08:14   | it hasn't been fixed. But there's a solution I discovered recently, I think it's been around              |
| 01:08:19   | for almost a year. And I just didn't know about it. [[Toolbox Pro]] [[Alex Hay]], that guy man,                  |
| 01:08:25   | we had him on the show, David. Yeah, I know. But I just didn't it didn't sink in how easy                 |
| 01:08:30   | it is. And so toolbox pro, you can apply tags very easily. Again, like on iOS, a choose                   |
| 01:08:35   | from menu shortcut would be a good idea. I did a whole video on this in the paperless                     |
| 01:08:41   | field guide that's not out yet, but it will be soon. But it's just, you know, good job.                   |
| 01:08:46   | So if you're trying to apply tags on iOS, and you're like me and hadn't sunk through                      |
| 01:08:51   | your thick skull yet, just get yourself toolbox pro, get the pay for the additional features.             |
| 01:08:57   | That's one of the additional features. And you can absolutely tag with with search and                    |
| 01:09:03   | T and speed on the iPhone and iPad. Yeah, that's I love toolbox pro. I've been doing                      |
| 01:09:09   | some playing extra playing with it recently, because I'm doing a little screencast night                  |
| 01:09:13   | over a screencast online, hopefully in the not too distant future. And, you know, it's                    |
| 01:09:19   | great to see, you know, what things can be made available by a developer who just clearly                 |
| 01:09:23   | wants shortcuts to be better. And so, I mean, if Apple tried to hire him, I wouldn't be                   |
| 01:09:28   | that upset if all of the features made it over. Maybe. Yeah, I would actually not want                    |
| 01:09:33   | them to hire him because I feel like he's going to come up with even more that will                       |
| 01:09:36   | take too long. Yeah, this is true. This is true. Very true. Sorry, [[Alex]], we do love you,                  |
| 01:09:42   | but we won't let you be hired by Apple. If Alex needs good benefits and retirement                        |
| 01:09:47   | and stock options, I would not begrudge him. Well, this is very true. Yeah. All right.                    |
| 01:09:53   | Well, that was a lot of automation, Rosemary. Oh, it was, but it's great. And now we're                   |
| 01:09:57   | going to have some fun guests on in the not too distant future. And so we're going to                     |
| 01:10:02   | dive into different kinds of automation with them too. Yeah, we've got some really great                  |
| 01:10:06   | guests lined up. We've got some great content planned once iOS 14 ships. We are about to                  |
| 01:10:11   | record the member special episode. If you're a member, go check it out. We're going to                    |
| 01:10:16   | be talking about our time working for the mouse. And if you're not a member, you should                   |
| 01:10:21   | check it out. Yeah, you should. And there's, there's lots of fun stuff. This is our annual                |
| 01:10:26   | relay FM members month where you can go ahead and if you are a member of relay, then you                  |
| 01:10:31   | get a bonus episode of every single show, which is not on the same topic as normal, hence                 |
| 01:10:36   | working for the mouse rather than trapping a mouse, which was last year or automation,                    |
| 01:10:41   | which is of course our day to day topic. Yeah, I like how we did that. We went from trapping              |
| 01:10:45   | a mouse to working for one. Yeah. I mean, you know, trapped by the mouse, but in a                        |
| 01:10:49   | good way. There you go. There you go. Well, we are the automators. You can find us over                   |
| 01:10:53   | at relay.fm/automators. You can get involved with the forums at talk.automators.fm.                 |
| 01:11:00   | Thank you to our sponsors, the uptake, mint mobile and [[DEVONthink]], and we will see you                   |
| 01:11:05   | in a couple of weeks. Goodbye, everyone.                                                                  |
