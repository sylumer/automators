| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators, the podcast where we talk about how to automate your technology       |
| 00:06      | to do your work for you.                                                                                |
| 00:09      | Ta-da!                                                                                                  |
| 00:10      | My name is Rosemary Orchard, and I'm joined as always by David Sparks.                                  |
| 00:13      | Hey, David, how are you today?                                                                          |
| 00:14      | I am great, Rose.                                                                                       |
| 00:16      | So happy to be talking to you today.                                                                    |
| 00:18      | It's the holidays, and we've got some very cool and useful automation to share today.                   |
| 00:24      | So it's a win-win.                                                                                      |
| 00:26      | Yeah, we figured it was time to, you know, focus on some of these things.                               |
| 00:29      | Maybe talk about focus modes.                                                                           |
| 00:30      | I see what you did there.                                                                               |
| 00:31      | I see what you did.                                                                                     |
| 00:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 00:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 00:34      | Yeah, because focus modes came with iOS 15, it turns out you can automate stuff with                    |
| 00:39      | them.                                                                                                   |
| 00:40      | Who knew?                                                                                               |
| 00:41      | Yeah, and, you know, we talked about it on the show when it was first announced, but                    |
| 00:44      | now that it's been out a few months, I know I'm using it daily, and I think, Rose, you                  |
| 00:50      | are too.                                                                                                |
| 00:51      | So we thought it'd be fun to kind of, now that it's out there, go through what it's good                |
| 00:56      | for, what it's bad for, and how we're using it, and we're going to get deep and dirty                   |
| 01:02      | with our focus modes throughout this episode today.                                                     |
| 01:05      | So hopefully we can inspire you to try a few of these yourself.                                         |
| 01:09      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                             |
| 01:10      | And the one question I've heard time and time again from various friends and family members,            |
| 01:15      | what are these focus modes anyway?                                                                      |
| 01:17      | Because of course, people have just been using do not disturb, and do not disturb still exists.         |
| 01:22      | So, you know, people are wondering, perhaps, why would you use a focus mode over do not                 |
| 01:27      | disturb?                                                                                                |
| 01:28      | And at the very least, for me, David, it means that I can say, hey, you know, when I'm doing            |
| 01:33      | this kind of thing, I'm happy to let these people talk to me, but none of the other people.             |
| 01:38      | And that is a really good start for how I got into focus modes, because while I'm working,              |
| 01:45      | I would like for work people to be able to contact me.                                                  |
| 01:47      | My podcasting co-hosts to contact me, and, you know, some very close friends and family,                |
| 01:54      | but not anybody else.                                                                                   |
| 01:56      | But when I'm doing other things like podcasting, I don't want all those people to be able to            |
| 01:59      | talk to me.                                                                                             |
| 02:00      | And that was where I started falling down the rabbit hole of this is going to be incredibly             |
| 02:03      | useful.                                                                                                 |
| 02:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 02:05      | And if you were in that camp where, like, this is just a rebranded do not disturb, that's               |
| 02:09      | not correct.                                                                                            |
| 02:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 02:11      | This is really do not disturb plus, because it really gives you a lot more control in                   |
| 02:16      | multiple dimensions.                                                                                    |
| 02:17      | It gives you control over what can disturb you, because, I mean, do not disturb is it's                 |
| 02:23      | a one or a zero, you know, either everything gets in or nothing gets in.                                |
| 02:28      | Whereas with this, you can actually dial that in, where certain apps can get through.                   |
| 02:33      | And also, it's a plus in the sense that it allows you to make exceptions for people.                    |
| 02:39      | So you can decide who gets through.                                                                     |
| 02:41      | And that by adding the, you know, that degree of customisability, it allows you as the user             |
| 02:49      | to actually focus on things and use do not disturb plus more often, or what they call                   |
| 02:55      | focus mode.                                                                                             |
| 02:56      | Because in the past, like, I would not turn on, well, I would turn on do not disturb but                |
| 03:01      | on podcasting.                                                                                          |
| 03:02      | But it was always a, this harrowing thing because like, what if we're interviewing someone              |
| 03:07      | from Apple and Steven's texting me about the question we should ask, but it's getting kicked            |
| 03:12      | back to him with do not disturb because, you know, that that's what happens when you turn               |
| 03:17      | on something, which is a much of a blunt instrument is do not disturb and focus mode gives you          |
| 03:23      | a lot more granularity and it is way better.                                                            |
| 03:28      | Yes, yes.                                                                                               |
| 03:29      | And it starts with just, you know, let certain apps, semi notifications or let certain people           |
| 03:36      | send me notifications from whichever app they're coming from, which is really handy.                    |
| 03:40      | So for example, if you're my favourites, if you message me on [[Slack]], then I'll get that                  |
| 03:44      | the same as if you message me on iMessage because I've whitelisted you.                                 |
| 03:48      | But equally, if, you know, if I just want to say whitelist iMessage for a while, then                   |
| 03:54      | I can whitelist messages app and I'll get everything from messages, which in some focus                 |
| 03:59      | modes is what I want to do and in other focus modes is very definitely not.                             |
| 04:03      | But notifications are a really small part of the puzzle.                                                |
| 04:08      | It turns out because it, you know, think you think do not disturb, it's about your notifications,       |
| 04:14      | but it's also about focus as the name implies.                                                          |
| 04:17      | And one of my favourite features that came with focus modes, and this is only available                  |
| 04:21      | on the iPhone and the iPad, is the home screens being able to choose specific home screens              |
| 04:27      | to show in different focus modes is brilliant.                                                          |
| 04:32      | So what I've done for years is have, or since this became available, I think that might                 |
| 04:37      | have been iOS 13, I want to say, is if you tap and hold on the dots at the bottom of                    |
| 04:43      | your home screen, then you jump into a pages view where you can have and you can rearrange              |
| 04:49      | your pages as well, so that you can have multiple pages and show them at different times, basically     |
| 04:57      | when you want.                                                                                          |
| 04:58      | So I had a travel page that for ages was just always hidden, and it would just be turned                |
| 05:03      | on when I needed it.                                                                                    |
| 05:04      | But now I can have a whole bunch of extra home screens and toggle most of them off most                 |
| 05:08      | of the time and switch to the one that I need for the focus mode.                                       |
| 05:12      | So my work one just shows me Outlook and [[Slack]] and a few other things, but my podcasting                |
| 05:17      | one shows me a completely different set of applications, which I love.                                  |
| 05:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 05:22      | And, you know, kind of getting back to the idea of focus, your home screen is a great                   |
| 05:26      | focus trigger for you, like if you look at your home screen and you see nothing there,                  |
| 05:31      | but reading apps, you know, [[Apple Books]], Kindle, whatever, your notes app, you're like, oh,             |
| 05:37      | I should be reading right now because that's what my phone is giving me.                                |
| 05:41      | And whereas if you look at it and you see, you know, your personal apps like photos or                  |
| 05:48      | you know, things you do on your downtime, it encourages you to do your personal stuff                   |
| 05:53      | and not work, or if you look at it and you see all your work apps and it encourages you                 |
| 05:58      | to work.                                                                                                |
| 05:59      | And this is a feature like Rose said has been on the mobile devices for a while by and like             |
| 06:05      | she said, just hold and tap on the little like centre section below the apps and then                   |
| 06:10      | you can do it.                                                                                          |
| 06:11      | And like Rose, I've had a couple of these over the years that I that I kept, but I think                |
| 06:16      | it really comes into its own with focus mode because, you know, the idea of focus mode is               |
| 06:21      | it kind of takes over your device and pushes you in a healthy direction for whatever it                 |
| 06:26      | is you've chosen, you're going to do in that moment.                                                    |
| 06:28      | And, you know, there's, there's like an intentionality element to this and there's, you know, there's   |
| 06:35      | a focus element to it and you're right.                                                                 |
| 06:38      | In addition to controlling who gets through to you or what apps, it also helps give you                 |
| 06:43      | a nudge to do the right thing at the right time.                                                        |
| 06:47      | Yes, yes.                                                                                               |
| 06:49      | And I think that is it, isn't it?                                                                       |
| 06:51      | It's about allowing us to be more intentional with our devices and how we use them.                     |
| 06:57      | So the, you know, if you want to, for example, not be encouraged to use your phone, then                |
| 07:01      | one of the features you can turn on is the dimmed home screen.                                          |
| 07:05      | And so your home screen gets that sort of black overlay, just like it gets in the sleep                 |
| 07:09      | focus mode.                                                                                             |
| 07:11      | And you know, all of the things like that, which contribute to how we feel about our                    |
| 07:16      | devices in a specific moment, but, you know, it leads into better work results, at least                |
| 07:23      | some of the time, not all the time, you know, it's not one of those magic features, unfortunately,      |
| 07:28      | but it does definitely help because I pick up my phone and after I swipe out of the application         |
| 07:34      | that I've, you know, used, I see, oh wait, you know, if it's during the working day,                    |
| 07:39      | then I'll probably see Outlook or similar and all of that is incredibly helpful for                     |
| 07:45      | making sure that I get the things done that I want and need to do.                                      |
| 07:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 07:50      | And there are some minor quibbles we have with focus mode.                                              |
| 07:53      | We're going to get to that in a minute, but I think the overall statement I want to say                 |
| 07:57      | about focus mode is that it really works.                                                               |
| 08:00      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 08:01      | You know, sometimes Apple does release half baked features where it was like some idea                  |
| 08:05      | that didn't get really completed or all the, you know, dots didn't get connected.                       |
| 08:11      | Focus mode largely is a complete feature and impressively it's a complete feature on all                |
| 08:18      | of the platforms.                                                                                       |
| 08:19      | So like before we started the show today, I set my podcast focus mode, I'm going to tell                |
| 08:24      | you about that later in the show, but I'm sitting here looking at my Mac and I look                     |
| 08:28      | in the upper corner and the podcast focus mode is turned on on my Mac.                                  |
| 08:31      | So it, it just populates all the way down from the Apple watch to the biggest Mac Pro,                  |
| 08:37      | you're going to have a consistency of focus mode across your devices.                                   |
| 08:41      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 08:42      | And you don't have to enable that, but I definitely considered it a very good reason to upgrade.        |
| 08:49      | It was one of those things where I was kind of a little bit on the fence about it.                      |
| 08:54      | And then I realised, no, actually, I really do want everything sinking across all my devices            |
| 08:59      | so that the notifications that I get while I'm working on my work laptop are the same                   |
| 09:04      | as the ones that I would get on any device so that everything really is in sync together.               |
| 09:10      | And because they synchronise, that means that when I enable my podcasting focus mode on                 |
| 09:15      | my Mac, everything else goes into my podcasting focus mode.                                             |
| 09:19      | And that does mean that I don't have accidental dings and pings and sounds from various devices         |
| 09:27      | because it just happens, which is great.                                                                |
| 09:30      | And, you know, it's funny because that was a total no brainer for me.                                   |
| 09:34      | It's like, to me, it doesn't even work if you don't have it across everything because,                  |
| 09:39      | you know, just, I know that not everybody listening is making a podcast, but, you know,                 |
| 09:44      | a rookie mistake in a podcast is to be recording and have your phone start to make noises.              |
| 09:48      | And this just solves that.                                                                              |
| 09:50      | But I mean, make the case rows for not allowing it to sink between devices because I never              |
| 09:56      | could see one.                                                                                          |
| 09:57      | But it sounds to me like you had some ideas that it may not be.                                         |
| 09:59      | I briefly considered it mostly because on my work machine, I didn't know if I should                    |
| 10:05      | be upgrading straight away to Monterey, if everything was going to go ahead and work.                   |
| 10:10      | And then I had, you know, I realised I use a very small number of applications for work                 |
| 10:16      | and [[Firefox]] obviously was going to work.                                                                |
| 10:18      | And I just checked the others and went, yeah, like this is going to be fine.                            |
| 10:21      | And honestly, if it isn't fine, I'm going to just find an alternative to these applications             |
| 10:25      | because I don't want to be held away from upgrading every year.                                         |
| 10:29      | But the only other thing that I could think of is perhaps if you've got, you know, certain              |
| 10:35      | work applications, and you do want to always get those notifications on your work device,               |
| 10:42      | but you have those, for example, teams installed on your phone as well, and you don't want              |
| 10:46      | to get notifications from teams when you're in any of the other focus modes.                            |
| 10:52      | That could be an argument for because that way, you know, you pick up your work machine                 |
| 10:56      | at, I don't know, 9 p.m. for a work emergency of some kind.                                             |
| 11:00      | Hopefully you're not one of those people that has to do stuff on call.                                  |
| 11:03      | But then you still get notifications from work applications regardless of whether or                    |
| 11:06      | not your sleep focus mode has started kicking in or something.                                          |
| 11:09      | That could potentially be an argument in favor of not syncing them.                                     |
| 11:14      | But personally, I find I would much rather, you know, when I hop into a meeting at work,                |
| 11:18      | I have considered I've not yet got to creating a work meeting focus mode, which I could then            |
| 11:26      | enable for an hour.                                                                                     |
| 11:28      | But yeah, that is, you know, something that then, you know, you can, you can just do.                   |
| 11:35      | So there's arguments for and against, but I think it's pretty much all in favor of for                  |
| 11:39      | syncing across your devices.                                                                            |
| 11:42      | And also another point about focus mode is this is a feature that only Apple could bring.               |
| 11:47      | Third-party apps don't have this power.                                                                 |
| 11:50      | Basecamp famously was one of the early kind of web-based collaborative apps that put in                 |
| 11:55      | a downtime like feature in the app where they would put a thing in like after five o'clock.             |
| 12:03      | If anybody on your work Basecamp messaged you, it would auto-respond, hey, he's not around              |
| 12:08      | right now.                                                                                              |
| 12:09      | And it would not deliver a notification to you with the idea that you're off work, you                  |
| 12:13      | should not be interrupted by work, which I think is a good, good feature.                               |
| 12:17      | But you couldn't do that across all these apps and with the notification system and                     |
| 12:22      | everything else on the, the iPhone, iPad and Mac, there's just no way to like universally               |
| 12:28      | block that stuff unless it comes from Apple.                                                            |
| 12:31      | So Apple had to do this and they've done a really good job.                                             |
| 12:35      | I mean, this is like that Basecamp feature, but it's across all of your apps or all the                 |
| 12:39      | apps you choose for it to be and across all of the people, except the people you choose                 |
| 12:44      | to allow.                                                                                               |
| 12:45      | And you can put up to 10 of them on your phone.                                                         |
| 12:48      | I think I've got all 10 slots used, Rose, so I'm, I'm fully in, but the, so you can                     |
| 12:54      | really be really granular with this and I don't know, I mean, the reason we're giving                   |
| 13:01      | it a whole show is because I think this could be really life-changing and really help you               |
| 13:06      | work better with your technology.                                                                       |
| 13:07      | And I really want everybody to try this out.                                                            |
| 13:10      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 13:11      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 13:12      | I think it is one of those things that once you get started figuring this out, you'll                   |
| 13:16      | quickly see other applications where you could use it.                                                  |
| 13:19      | There's one tiny little thing that I have to mention, David, because I would really,                    |
| 13:23      | really, really like Apple to fix this.                                                                  |
| 13:26      | And I have filed feedback on this to be clear.                                                          |
| 13:29      | And I'm sure the people have as well.                                                                   |
| 13:30      | By default, if you allow notifications from an application, then you allow notifications                |
| 13:36      | generally and you cannot say, hey, allow notifications from this application only in this specific      |
| 13:42      | focus mode.                                                                                             |
| 13:43      | So going back to the Teams example that I mentioned earlier, I can say, hey, yeah, allow                |
| 13:47      | Teams notifications in my work focus mode, but I can't block Teams notifications outside                |
| 13:52      | of a focus mode, which kind of defeats the point of having a work focus mode.                           |
| 13:57      | If I have to enable my work applications there, but I still get work notifications the rest             |
| 14:01      | of the time.                                                                                            |
| 14:02      | They have a solution for that.                                                                          |
| 14:05      | And that is.                                                                                            |
| 14:06      | Use a focus mode all the time.                                                                          |
| 14:07      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                          |
| 14:08      | Exactly.                                                                                                |
| 14:09      | Just turn on a focus mode that blocks it when you're not in work mode.                                  |
| 14:13      | And you can do that.                                                                                    |
| 14:14      | Another, there's a couple of like little gotchas here.                                                  |
| 14:17      | You got to be careful of that.                                                                          |
| 14:18      | That's one of them.                                                                                     |
| 14:19      | I mean, you know, when you don't have focus mode on, obviously everything gets through                  |
| 14:24      | and if you really want to control it, you almost need a focus mode at all times.                        |
| 14:29      | Another couple of gotchas, I think with this are it really is focused on letting you remember           |
| 14:39      | the story about the little, little boy with the dyke, you know, you heard the story.                    |
| 14:45      | Maybe it's just an American thing.                                                                      |
| 14:46      | Like, like there's a little boy, I think it was in Holland.                                             |
| 14:50      | You don't even say Holland you just say Netherlands. Man,                                                    |
| 14:52      | I'm really out of it, but the, but when I was a kid, it was as Holland to me, but there's               |
| 14:57      | a little boy, there's a big dyke that blocks all the water and he plugs the hole with his               |
| 15:02      | finger and saves the village, you know, but the, the, the idea of focus mode is you're                  |
| 15:07      | punching little holes, you cut everything out and you punch little holes to let specific                |
| 15:13      | apps or people in.                                                                                      |
| 15:15      | Well, if you let an app in that is a lot of, got a lot of notifications involved, you're                |
| 15:21      | punching a big hole.                                                                                    |
| 15:22      | I think a lot of people make the mistake of saying, well, I need to have messages, you                  |
| 15:26      | know, I need to let messages through.                                                                   |
| 15:28      | But then that means anybody who sends you a message is going to get through.                            |
| 15:31      | Whereas if I block messages, but I let Rose through, if I let Rosemary Orchard, the person               |
| 15:37      | anything she sends me through messages will come to me, but things other people send will               |
| 15:42      | not.                                                                                                    |
| 15:43      | So I think where you would think you want to block, you want to let messages in because                 |
| 15:46      | you think, well, there's some messages I need to get.                                                   |
| 15:49      | That's not the way you do it.                                                                           |
| 15:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 15:51      | Instead, you're making the little hole in the dyke, just letting specific people through.               |
| 15:55      | And I think you got to kind of get your head around that when you're setting these up.                  |
| 15:58      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 15:59      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 16:00      | And the, so the other thing is, is if you allow a person, then if I call you and you've                 |
| 16:05      | enabled me, then that'll go through.                                                                    |
| 16:07      | If I send you a message on Telegram or an email that will come through.                                 |
| 16:10      | So essentially you're just saying, hey, anything from Rosemary consider it important.                   |
| 16:15      | But and that is really good.                                                                            |
| 16:18      | And it can be a little bit tricky to set up multiple people for a focus mode.                           |
| 16:24      | And I actually have a little trick for that, which is if you tap on the allowed people,                 |
| 16:29      | then in the top left, there's groups.                                                                   |
| 16:31      | And if you create groups for your contacts, then this makes it much easier because what                 |
| 16:35      | you can do then is if you're in, if you look at, say, a group and I'm just going to pick,               |
| 16:39      | I think I'm going to pick my holiday card list, David, because it's that time of year,                  |
| 16:44      | then it's much easier to just go through and tap down and enable every single person in                 |
| 16:48      | that group, which, you know, gets you, you know, everything you want.                                   |
| 16:53      | Unfortunately, there is no allow everybody in this group.                                               |
| 16:55      | It would be really good if you could just say, hey, if they're in this group, let them                  |
| 17:00      | through, but you can't do that.                                                                         |
| 17:02      | And on iOS, I've been using card hop to set up those groups, which has been great.                      |
| 17:08      | But that that's how I've set up people rather than specific applications, because most                  |
| 17:14      | of the time you're right is specific applications that I'm after.                                       |
| 17:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 17:18      | It really isn't that good at allowing large groups of people.                                           |
| 17:24      | Another setting there that is available to you as you set up one of these, as you can                   |
| 17:28      | say, allow VIPs, and I think that is one of the hacks to this.                                          |
| 17:33      | Like if you've got a group of people, like Rose is a VIP on my list and so I, she can                   |
| 17:39      | always get through any one of these that I allow her to get through on.                                 |
| 17:43      | Like when I'm doing like real focus work, I don't even let VIPs through and I just card                 |
| 17:48      | really small holes.                                                                                     |
| 17:49      | There's one for my wife and one for each of my kids.                                                    |
| 17:52      | But for a lot of my focus modes, I'm allowing VIPs through and that saves me the trouble                |
| 17:58      | of having to add Rose manually every time.                                                              |
| 18:01      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 18:02      | You know, whereas like.                                                                                 |
| 18:04      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                               |
| 18:05      | I've just discovered.                                                                                   |
| 18:06      | So when you're setting up a new focus mode, which is something I can do because I have                  |
| 18:09      | less than 10 focus modes, I can now select a group of people to be able to come through.                |
| 18:16      | And then when I tap done, it says other people allow calls from and then the name of the                |
| 18:20      | group.                                                                                                  |
| 18:21      | And then you can allow application and to send you notifications and I'll say allow none                |
| 18:27      | and don't want to turn that on automatically.                                                           |
| 18:30      | But I don't see this anywhere inside the notification settings, sorry, inside the focus mode settings.  |
| 18:36      | That is frustrating.                                                                                    |
| 18:38      | I'm going to file some feedback on that because I think that's a little bit broken that you             |
| 18:42      | can set up a group of people now when you set up a focus mode, but you cannot set up.                   |
| 18:47      | But you can't see that that group of people has been allowed.                                           |
| 18:51      | That seems weird.                                                                                       |
| 18:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 18:53      | I mean, they're circling the answer, but they're not quite at the answer yet.                           |
| 18:56      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 18:57      | Well, they'll get there.                                                                                |
| 19:00      | This is early days.                                                                                     |
| 19:01      | And once again, what I said earlier, I really meant, I feel like this feature is absolutely             |
| 19:06      | solid.                                                                                                  |
| 19:07      | I mean, it's easy.                                                                                      |
| 19:09      | We nitpick at it, but I think that in general, it's a great feature and as shipped, I'm very            |
| 19:17      | happy with it.                                                                                          |
| 19:18      | But of course I want more.                                                                              |
| 19:19      | Of course.                                                                                              |
| 19:20      | Of course we want more because we are the automators and we want to automate all of the things          |
| 19:25      | and also to see what we have automated here because sometimes it's being able to see what               |
| 19:31      | you did that allows you to see, ah, there's where my problem is coming from rather than                 |
| 19:36      | anything else.                                                                                          |
| 19:37      | But yes, I'm really glad focus modes exist.                                                             |
| 19:41      | And they're certainly making my life better, David.                                                     |

| 20:19      | I was recently using TextExpander for the secret centre at work.                                        |
| 20:23      | It sounds really silly, but because I did have an FAQ, but people still emailed me with                 |
| 20:27      | the questions, so being able to use TextExpander with a custom group just for the work secret           |
| 20:32      | centre was really useful.                                                                               |
| 20:34      | And I have to say, I love that it was so easy to set up.                                                |
| 20:37      | I typed all the things, so I already had them ready to copy and paste.                                  |
| 20:41      | And of course, it boosted my productivity by letting me send full paragraphs of text                    |
| 20:44      | in seconds.                                                                                             |
| 20:45      | And of course, I included a link to the FAQ every time.                                                 |

| 21:00      | Our thanks to TextExpander from Smile for their support of the show and Relay FM.                      |
| 21:04      | All right, right before the break, you mentioned the word automation and focus, and we are              |
| 21:09      | the Automators podcast.                                                                                 |
| 21:10      | We need to cover that a little bit.                                                                     |
| 21:14      | Focus mode did ship with kind of thorough automation support.                                           |
| 21:19      | Starting with shortcuts, I think is probably the place to go.                                           |
| 21:23      | A focus mode can be a target of a shortcut, which means you can have a shortcut that says,              |
| 21:30      | by the way, set this as the focus mode.                                                                 |
| 21:33      | It can also be the source of a shortcut where you can run under the middle automation tab               |
| 21:40      | in shortcuts.                                                                                           |
| 21:41      | You can use triggering of a focus mode as a trigger, just like you can use a time trigger               |
| 21:46      | or any of the many triggers we talked about in the show in the past now, setting a focus                |
| 21:51      | mode as a trigger that will fire off a shortcut.                                                        |
| 21:54      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 21:55      | You want to talk about the state of those things, where we're at right now?                             |
| 21:59      | Well, I think, first of all, we should mention that inside of the settings application for              |
| 22:04      | a focus mode, you can actually use, there's a turn on automatically feature where you                   |
| 22:10      | can use times and also places to trigger it, and then there's a smart activation as well.               |
| 22:17      | The advantage of using the location inside of the focus mode versus inside of shortcuts                 |
| 22:22      | is this then happens entirely automatically, which allows me to get around my, hey, when                |
| 22:28      | I get to this location, run this automation for me without me having to manually tap the                |
| 22:34      | shortcut notification that pops up, because that is really helpful.                                     |
| 22:39      | It also means that the list of automations I have inside of shortcuts is slightly smaller,              |
| 22:45      | because I have a lot of automations there and I can't name them, so I have to just scroll               |
| 22:49      | and see if I can identify which one it is based on the information available to me there.               |
| 22:56      | Using the automations inside of settings for app, location, and time is my preferred way                |
| 23:02      | if those are applicable, because that, for me, works very well.                                         |
| 23:08      | I have to say, I'm also running automations when focus modes start, and that is working                 |
| 23:14      | incredibly well for me now on the most recent beta.                                                     |
| 23:19      | It allows me to easily make sure that things happen or don't happen for me at certain times.            |
| 23:26      | For example, when I turn on my podcasting focus mode, I use my calendar to check from                   |
| 23:30      | recording iOS today, and if I am, I put my phone in light mode, because it's easier                     |
| 23:35      | to show the light mode version of my phone on screen, but otherwise it leaves in dark                   |
| 23:40      | mode.                                                                                                   |
| 23:41      | When I turn on my work focus mode, it actually checks if it's a holiday and then turns it               |
| 23:46      | back off if it's a holiday, so that I don't, you know, if my focus mode turns on, then                  |
| 23:50      | it'll just turn right back off again if I'm not working, which is great.                                |
| 23:53      | Yeah, and so I am using the public release right now on my phone of iOS, and that trigger               |
| 24:02      | does not work.                                                                                          |
| 24:04      | Currently, as you're listening to the show, or maybe they'll have updated by the time                   |
| 24:07      | this releases, but it's clearly they've got it fixed in the beta builds, and I guess now                |
| 24:12      | Rose, I have to put my phone back into beta mode.                                                       |
| 24:14      | Thanks a lot.                                                                                           |
| 24:15      | Sorry.                                                                                                  |
| 24:16      | Sorry.                                                                                                  |
| 24:17      | Sorry.                                                                                                  |
| 24:18      | But they currently, as shipping, when you trigger a focus mode, it does not trigger the                 |
| 24:24      | shortcut, and that's a shame, because I think it's a really great idea.                                 |
| 24:28      | It's not the end of the world, though, because I've historically triggered kind of, you                 |
| 24:33      | know, modes from a choose from menu list that's in the dock of my phone, and, you know, recording       |
| 24:40      | automators is one of them.                                                                              |
| 24:41      | It literally, it changes my watch face.                                                                 |
| 24:43      | It does a bunch of stuff, you know, because I like to, when I am, I'm really a big fan                  |
| 24:47      | of contextual computing, and I like to really force my brain into an automator sized box                |
| 24:53      | anytime we start recording the show.                                                                    |
| 24:57      | But it would be cool to be able to trigger that from the focus mode rather than a shortcut              |
| 25:02      | trigger.                                                                                                |
| 25:03      | And it's not here yet, but it's on the way, and that's kind of really the story of shortcuts            |
| 25:07      | later.                                                                                                  |
| 25:08      | It's like these guys are, and gals are peddling like mad behind the scenes, because you can             |
| 25:13      | see all this great stuff coming out in the betas, where they're fixing a bunch of things                |
| 25:17      | that us cranky automators have been talking about.                                                      |
| 25:21      | Yes, yes, they have.                                                                                    |
| 25:23      | The location, I wanted to mention, so the automatically turn on a focus mode when you                   |
| 25:29      | think it should be turned on feature has never really worked very well for me.                          |
| 25:33      | My life is too chaotic, I think, for it to figure me out.                                               |
| 25:37      | And the location one, I was really a big fan of that one, particularly because I have a                 |
| 25:42      | focus mode called Disneyland, and I want, when I go to Disneyland, I have a special                     |
| 25:46      | home screen, and I'm going to talk about all this later in the show.                                    |
| 25:49      | But the location map that they use is too small.                                                        |
| 25:53      | I mean, they don't let you change the size of the geofence, all they do is say, when                    |
| 25:59      | you get to this address, turn it on, when you leave this address, turn it off, which                    |
| 26:03      | is great if you work in an office building that, you know, pretty small, but something                  |
| 26:07      | the size of the Disneyland resort, I need a much bigger fence, because what happens                     |
| 26:13      | now is I can see it turn on when I'm like pulling into the parking lot, and by the time                 |
| 26:18      | I get to the gate, it's already turned off again, you know, it's just too small.                        |
| 26:23      | So one thing I have found with this is, so you add this very specific address, and it                   |
| 26:29      | shows you a circle on the map for that, but you can add multiple locations to this.                     |
| 26:36      | So you can get around that by adding other locations as well.                                           |
| 26:40      | Which means, for example, for work, I have a couple of different locations that I might                 |
| 26:46      | go to and want my work focus mode enabled, and only my work focus mode to be clear.                     |
| 26:51      | So I've added all of those locations.                                                                   |
| 26:53      | So you might be able to get away with that, David, by adding multiple Disney locations.                 |
| 26:57      | So add the Disneyland parking lot, and the Disneyland front gate, and the Disneyland,                   |
| 27:03      | you know, main park, and California adventures, and so on and so forth.                                 |
| 27:06      | If you add all of the locations, then hopefully you're going to end up with a not possible              |
| 27:12      | to see, to be clear, but, you know, you'll end up with a series of overlapping bubbles,                 |
| 27:17      | which then cover all of Disney.                                                                         |
| 27:19      | It might be a bit tricky, but I think you can probably do it with a bit of research to                  |
| 27:24      | find the addresses of multiple places.                                                                  |
| 27:27      | That said, Apple, you let us have the ever-increasing circle in Find My, where we can set up large      |
| 27:35      | circles for locations of people to be notified.                                                         |
| 27:38      | It would be really nice if we could just increase the circle in focus modes as well.                    |
| 27:43      | Feels like that's something they maybe didn't anticipate, large working areas, but I'm                  |
| 27:46      | sure people working at Disney would appreciate that too.                                                |
| 27:49      | Yeah, no, this is totally working, Rose.                                                                |
| 27:51      | Thank you so much.                                                                                      |
| 27:52      | I didn't realise.                                                                                       |
| 27:53      | It never occurred to me that I could put multiple locations, but I've now added the Disneyland          |
| 27:58      | park and the parking lot.                                                                               |
| 27:59      | I'm going to add more once we hang up here, but I think I can make this work.                           |
| 28:04      | There we go.                                                                                            |
| 28:05      | Once again, troubleshooting with Rose.                                                                  |
| 28:07      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                               |
| 28:08      | I mean, what I have to say is it's taken quite a bit of time of playing with these things               |
| 28:13      | to figure out the areas where the smartness actually is smart.                                          |
| 28:20      | Just like you, my smart activation doesn't work, because the vast majority of time I'm                  |
| 28:25      | working from home, and I can be sitting at my computer, and if I'm on lunch, then I might,              |
| 28:30      | you know, I'll turn off my work focus mode and put on my podcasting focus mode because                  |
| 28:33      | I'm going to do some podcasting prep, but then I go back to work.                                       |
| 28:37      | As far as my phone is concerned, I'm sitting in the same place.                                         |
| 28:40      | You haven't moved.                                                                                      |
| 28:41      | What's going on?                                                                                        |
| 28:42      | The answer is I've switched computers, but my phone can't see that, and you would think                 |
| 28:48      | that it would realise based on the fact that I only use one computer while I'm working                  |
| 28:52      | and the other computers happen the rest of the time, that it would know what was going                  |
| 28:55      | on there, but the smart activation, personally, I found, has not been working great.                    |
| 29:01      | That said, time-based, location-based, and app-based, 100% rock solid loving those.                     |
| 29:07      | And I have to say, the app-based stuff, it seems like that would be a little bit strange,               |
| 29:14      | but if you're going to have a reading focus mode, for example, then you can have it trigger             |
| 29:18      | for multiple different applications, so for example, Instapaper, Pocket, Books, Kindle,                 |
| 29:23      | all of them, and then you get all of the great stuff.                                                   |
| 29:28      | Yeah, the app-based ones are solid for me as well, and in general, the way I trigger                    |
| 29:34      | them is through an app automation or through a shortcut automation, and that's just because             |
| 29:41      | it's been broken.                                                                                       |
| 29:42      | I think, ultimately, I would like to switch it where I set the focus mode and then other                |
| 29:48      | shortcuts trigger to make other things happen, and then we keep teasing it, but we're going             |
| 29:52      | to go through ours in a minute, and I've got some ideas I want to share with that.                      |
| 29:56      | Before we get into that, before we start comparing shortcuts, you had a good tip as well for            |
| 30:02      | triggering these with an app launch on the Mac, which I thought was a clever solution.                  |
| 30:08      | Could you share that?                                                                                   |
| 30:09      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                             |
| 30:10      | So I use Bunch a lot of the time to switch between essentially context, so I have Bunches               |
| 30:15      | to launch recording automators and things like that, and I want to use my podcasting                    |
| 30:20      | focus mode for these, but triggering a focus mode on Mac as an automation seemed pretty                 |
| 30:26      | tricky until I remembered that if you're in the gallery view of shortcuts and you have                  |
| 30:30      | to be in the gallery view, you can't be in the edit shortcut view, and then you select                  |
| 30:35      | one of your shortcuts, then you can use the file menu to add it to your doc.                            |
| 30:40      | And then once you've added it to your doc, you can actually right-click and remove it                   |
| 30:43      | from your doc, but adding it to your doc puts a shortcut to it, a shortcut to your shortcut,            |
| 30:49      | in your user's applications folder.                                                                     |
| 30:51      | It does not put them in the global applications folder available to everyone.                           |
| 30:54      | It's for your specific user, but that then makes that shortcut available to all of the                  |
| 31:00      | other apps like [[Alfred]], Bunch, and so on and so forth.                                                  |
| 31:04      | And this is a great way to add ways to trigger shortcuts to any of your automations on the              |
| 31:11      | Mac because keep up my stroke and run these applications because they are essentially                   |
| 31:15      | just saying, hey, I'm going to run a shortcut now, and that's it.                                       |
| 31:18      | That's all they do.                                                                                     |
| 31:20      | But it works really well.                                                                               |
| 31:22      | So now I have a couple of different shortcuts for starting focus modes and ending focus                 |
| 31:28      | modes in shortcuts, but they're basically there to be applications on my Mac.                           |
| 31:35      | There is another bonus tip that I have that at least the time of recording is working                   |
| 31:39      | perfectly for me, and that is if you turn off Do Not Disturb, it will disable all of                    |
| 31:45      | your focus modes or whichever focus mode is active.                                                     |
| 31:47      | So if you have a focus mode enabled, you don't have to disable that specific focus mode.                |
| 31:52      | You can disable Do Not Disturb, and it will disable your focus mode for you, which is                   |
| 31:56      | a really nice trick to reduce the number of different automations that I need for handling              |
| 32:01      | focus modes.                                                                                            |
| 32:02      | Yeah, and I do think that lingering focus modes can become a problem.                                   |
| 32:07      | I know I've gotten caught in that trap a few times where I find that I have wake up and                 |
| 32:14      | I've had a focus mode running since yesterday, and that was limiting the way people can get             |
| 32:20      | through to me.                                                                                          |
| 32:21      | But there's a bunch of things to do that.                                                               |
| 32:23      | I mean, one way is to automate triggering a different focus mode, and you can do that.                  |
| 32:28      | Like the sleep one, for me, turns on automatically at night, so at the end of the day, it always        |
| 32:33      | kind of changes focus to sleep mode.                                                                    |
| 32:35      | And then you could also run a time-based automation to just say turn off focus mode.                    |
| 32:41      | When you set the focus mode up, it gives you the ability to say, like, leave it on for                  |
| 32:45      | an hour or until I leave this location.                                                                 |
| 32:48      | So there's a lot of different ways Apple goes about helping you out with this, but that                 |
| 32:52      | is something you need to be aware of, that if you get into focus modes, make sure you've                |
| 32:57      | got a way to remind you.                                                                                |
| 33:00      | And honestly, the phone makes it so easy, because the lock screen of the phone shows                    |
| 33:03      | you an icon of the current focus mode.                                                                  |
| 33:06      | So anytime you look at your phone, you know what focus mode it's set in.                                |
| 33:10      | So they obviously thought this through.                                                                 |
| 33:13      | And it shows it as an icon on the top of your Apple Watch face as well, which is really                 |
| 33:18      | nice.                                                                                                   |
| 33:19      | You know, you glance at your Apple Watch face, and right now I can see some headphones,                 |
| 33:23      | and that's because I'm in my podcasting mode.                                                           |
| 33:26      | Me too.                                                                                                 |
| 33:27      | Yeah, they didn't have a microphone.                                                                    |
| 33:29      | I feel like they missed a trick there.                                                                  |
| 33:31      | It would have been nice to have a microphone, especially because I use Tooth Fairy, which               |
| 33:34      | has my AirPods Max in the menu bar as well.                                                             |
| 33:36      | So I have AirPods Max next to AirPods Max.                                                              |
| 33:39      | But it's really nice to be able to just see the focus modes everywhere.                                 |
| 33:44      | One of the things I'm doing, which perhaps is overkill for some people, and for other                   |
| 33:50      | people that go, this is the absolutely perfect solution that I need, is when I turn on certain          |
| 33:56      | focus modes, I have checks run, or just a schedule directly, a shortcut on my push cut                  |
| 34:06      | notification, push cut automation server.                                                               |
| 34:09      | So my push call automation server is an iPod that's just sitting here, and it runs push                 |
| 34:14      | cut the entire time it's running the automation server.                                                 |
| 34:16      | So whenever something needs to happen automation wise, it will do that for me.                          |
| 34:23      | But I schedule for in, for example, with podcasting, when I start podcasting, turning on the podcasting |
| 34:29      | focus mode, that shortcut, wherever I run it, will send a automation to the push cut                    |
| 34:37      | automation server for in two hours, turn off the podcasting focus mode, which is actually               |
| 34:42      | just, you know, turn off focus mode, because it's all the focus modes.                                  |
| 34:46      | And that is because my podcast, I almost never need the two hour window, you know, everything           |
| 34:51      | should be wrapped up in that time.                                                                      |
| 34:53      | But that means that then it's definitely going to be turned off.                                        |
| 34:57      | And I use a similar thing for work days.                                                                |
| 35:00      | So when when work is enabled, first of all, it checks for the holiday.                                  |
| 35:04      | And if it's holiday, it just turns it straight back off because I don't need my work focus              |
| 35:07      | mode enabled.                                                                                           |
| 35:08      | But then it checks for a couple of very specific things in my calendar, because my doctor's             |
| 35:13      | surgery has a wonderful feature.                                                                        |
| 35:16      | All of the doctors call using no caller ID.                                                             |
| 35:20      | They don't call and it appears on your phone as the reception number or anything like that.             |
| 35:24      | No, it appears as no caller ID.                                                                         |
| 35:26      | And this is something you cannot allow through a focus mode, or at least I have been unable             |
| 35:30      | to allow no caller ID for a focus mode.                                                                 |
| 35:34      | That is a limitation.                                                                                   |
| 35:35      | Agreed.                                                                                                 |
| 35:36      | It is.                                                                                                  |
| 35:37      | It is a very bothersome limitation when your doctor's surgery uses that to get in touch                 |
| 35:42      | with you because missing a phone call means you have to book another appointment and so                 |
| 35:45      | on and so forth.                                                                                        |
| 35:46      | If the doctor doesn't call you back like five minutes later and you haven't realised in                 |
| 35:50      | that time.                                                                                              |
| 35:51      | So what I do is I check for any of the doctor's appointments.                                           |
| 35:55      | Fortunately, I use an app to book my appointments and so it always adds things with the same            |
| 35:59      | kind of name and there's the same kind of information.                                                  |
| 36:01      | So I look for any of those and then get the start time and turn off focus mode 15 minutes               |
| 36:07      | before that.                                                                                            |
| 36:08      | And that works for me because it means that then focus modes are turned off and so I do                 |
| 36:15      | get the phone call and then they're going, oh, yeah, I forgot that was going to come                    |
| 36:18      | through.                                                                                                |
| 36:19      | Well, thanks, pass me for setting this up.                                                              |
| 36:22      | I am for a long time, I've been running timers.                                                         |
| 36:25      | I keep track of my day and so I've built up these muscles of mode switching.                            |
| 36:31      | And I know that there's a lot of automation on this stuff.                                              |
| 36:34      | We've talked about it on the show, but to me, there is a certain bit of intentionality                  |
| 36:40      | of me manually saying, okay, now I'm stopping, you know, writing briefs and I'm starting                |
| 36:47      | eating lunch or whatever.                                                                               |
| 36:49      | And so me going in and pushing that button is not that hard for me, I've kind of built                  |
| 36:53      | that muscle.                                                                                            |
| 36:54      | So I've tied a lot of focus modes to existing shortcuts where I trigger them manually.                  |
| 36:59      | I don't have as much automation stuff, but like I do like the idea, like when I show                    |
| 37:03      | up at Disneyland, that my Disneyland home screen just shows up and a bunch of people                    |
| 37:07      | can't get a hold of me.                                                                                 |
| 37:09      | So I'm using it, but I'm not using it as thoroughly as you are because I actually kind of want          |
| 37:14      | the ability to say, okay, now, like before we started podcasting today, it's like that's                |
| 37:20      | part of the process is I've got a dock icon with the MacSparky bolt on it.                             |
| 37:26      | Just to choose from menu and one of the options is, you know, podcast the automators and it's           |
| 37:31      | like, okay, now it's on, like all the stuff starts happening, you know, and I'm doing                   |
| 37:36      | all this through shortcuts.                                                                             |
| 37:37      | And for me, it was a simple matter of just adding an extra step to it programmatically                  |
| 37:41      | saying, okay, turn on podcasting focus mode.                                                            |
| 37:45      | And when we finish today, as I kind of wrap up and record the ad and I always take notes                |
| 37:50      | that when we finish a recording, when all that stuff is done, I push a button again                     |
| 37:55      | and then I go on to the next thing.                                                                     |
| 37:56      | So I'm not quite as far down the automation rabbit hole as you are in this, but it's intentional.       |
| 38:02      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 38:03      | One of the things that I do try to do is I, so when, so I use bunch when I'm recording                  |
| 38:08      | and so I have a start recording section in there, which runs when I'm starting the recording.           |
| 38:14      | And then when I'm finishing, I do go ahead and say, you know, I'm done, like I finished,                |
| 38:18      | I turn off that bunch and that triggers the, you know, the stop recording or, and which                 |
| 38:25      | is also stopping my focus mode, which works really well.                                                |
| 38:29      | But if I forget, or for example, on Tuesdays, I have iOS today and then I've got ballet                 |
| 38:35      | quite soon afterwards.                                                                                  |
| 38:36      | So I immediately run off and every so often I realise afterwards I've forgotten to turn                 |
| 38:40      | it off, but it gets turned off automatically anyway by, by my automation setup.                         |
| 38:46      | So I set up my automation as a fail safe.                                                                |
| 38:49      | And actually one of the things I've just realised that I should build in is you can add an ID           |
| 38:54      | to these, these automations that you've got scheduled when I turn off the focus mode because            |
| 39:01      | I am using a very specific shortcut to do that on my Mac through bunch.                                 |
| 39:07      | And it's not the same one that I use when I turn off my focus mode otherwise with shortcuts.            |
| 39:15      | I've got two shortcuts to do kind of the same thing for various reasons.                                |
| 39:19      | I should give that an ID and then when I turn off the focus mode, I should cancel anything              |
| 39:23      | with that ID because that will then make sure that it won't turn off a different focus mode             |
| 39:27      | if I've enabled that afterwards.                                                                        |
| 39:29      | So, uh,                                                                                                 |
| 39:30      | Gang, did you hear that Rose goes to ballet on Tuesdays?                                                |
| 39:33      | You just slipped that in there.                                                                         |
| 39:35      | How do you just slip that in there?                                                                     |
| 39:37      | That's awesome.                                                                                         |
| 39:38      | It was something I've wanted to do for years.                                                           |
| 39:40      | And I found there's a class near me and it's, it's lovely.                                              |
| 39:44      | And it's really, really hard work, but the teacher is wonderful.                                        |
| 39:47      | The other students are lovely.                                                                          |
| 39:49      | Some people are taking it seriously.                                                                    |
| 39:51      | Some people are just doing it for fun.                                                                  |
| 39:52      | Other people doing it for exercise and I'm just doing it because it's fun and I need                    |
| 39:56      | to do more exercise.                                                                                    |
| 39:57      | That is the best way to do stuff like this.                                                             |
| 40:00      | Like I, I know that, you know, I'm playing the saxophone again and I'm no longer, when                  |
| 40:05      | I was a kid, I was doing it to get in an honour band or to get a gig or whatever.                        |
| 40:09      | Now I'm just doing it for the joy of doing it.                                                          |
| 40:11      | That makes all the difference.                                                                          |
| 40:13      | It's only a question of time before Rosemary Orchard shows up home from ballet tired and                |
| 40:19      | her robot vacuum like wheels over and unties her shoes for her or something.                            |
| 40:23      | You know, that's going to happen, you know, right?                                                      |
| 40:25      | I wear slip-on shoes to ballet for that exact reason, David.                                            |
| 40:28      | I don't know what, somehow automation is going to get involved.                                         |
| 40:31      | That's all I'm saying.                                                                                  |
| 40:32      | Oh yeah.                                                                                                |
| 40:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 40:34      | Well, when I leave the house, if the robot vacuum hasn't already run that day, it runs.                 |
| 40:36      | So, you know, it means that I come home and it's like, oh wow, hey, vacuumed, nice.                     |
| 40:43      | Extra bonus.                                                                                            |
| 40:44      | Well, last point on this, because I do want to talk about our focus modes, but just, you                |
| 40:48      | know, there's a lot of ways to trigger it.                                                              |
| 40:50      | And I think that's the point we're making.                                                              |
| 40:52      | And whether you want to push a button like me, whether you want to have a trigger automatically,        |
| 40:57      | these focus modes, Apple has come up with a lot of solutions.                                           |
| 41:01      | I am very curious for myself personally, now that I'm going to put this bait on my phone,               |
| 41:06      | it'll be more, it'll be sooner than I thought.                                                          |
| 41:09      | The ability to trigger the shortcut rather than from the menu item in my dock, but by                   |
| 41:15      | triggering the shortcut by picking a focus mode, whether that becomes the default for                   |
| 41:19      | me or not.                                                                                              |
| 41:20      | I'm not sure that's going to be the case, but I want to try it out.                                     |
| 41:23      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 41:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 41:25      | There's lots of good choices here.                                                                      |
| 41:27      | And also, don't forget that with the shortcuts in your menu bar, if you've got a shortcut               |
| 41:33      | in there to trigger your focus mode, then you can do that button from there as well,                    |
| 41:37      | which is a halfway house between automation and the manual deliberate choice, which is                  |
| 41:45      | incredibly good.                                                                                        |

| 42:17      | That's what Hunter Douglas does.                                                                        |
| 42:18      | They make amazing automated shades.                                                                     |
| 42:21      | Hunter Douglas's shades diffuse harsh sunlight instead casting a beautiful glow across the              |
| 42:26      | room with their adaptability.                                                                           |
| 42:28      | You can enjoy the view outside a window without needing to give up your privacy and you can             |
| 42:33      | bring this all together with Hunter Douglas's PowerView technology.                                     |
| 42:37      | This ensures that your shades will automatically reposition for the perfect balance of light,           |
| 42:43      | privacy and insulation morning, noon and night.                                                         |
| 42:46      | We're all automators gang.                                                                              |

| 42:50      | That's why they've added all of this great automation to their shade systems.                           |
| 42:55      | No longer do you have to be looking for the little pole that you pull on or the string                  |
| 42:59      | that gets stuck, everything happens automatically with Hunter Douglas shades and that's why             |
| 43:03      | I think they're a great fit for you and me.                                                             |

| 43:59      | FM.                                                                                                     |
| 44:00      | All right, Rose, we've been teasing everybody for a while now.                                          |
| 44:05      | Let's share our focus modes.                                                                            |
| 44:07      | Since we started, we've been talking about this podcasting one, which is the one listeners              |
| 44:11      | are not going to need, but maybe you could adapt this to whatever it is you do for work.                |
| 44:17      | Why don't we start with our podcast focus modes?                                                        |
| 44:19      | You want to go first?                                                                                   |
| 44:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 44:22      | So obviously, my podcast focus mode applies to multiple podcasts, just like yours, David.               |
| 44:27      | And I actually originally started out with a focus mode for each podcast, but I realised                |
| 44:32      | very quickly that I was essentially recreating exactly the same rules between the focus modes           |
| 44:37      | and trying to keep them in sync.                                                                        |
| 44:39      | And it just didn't make sense in any way, shape or form.                                                |
| 44:42      | So I have one single podcast focus mode that lets all of my wonderful podcasts co-host                  |
| 44:47      | through and a couple of very select applications, because in general, I don't really want most          |
| 44:54      | applications coming through while I'm podcasting, especially taking iOS today into account where        |
| 44:59      | I'm frequently sharing one of my devices on screen.                                                     |
| 45:01      | I really don't want those showing up.                                                                   |
| 45:04      | So I think I've got PushCut and just a few people coming through there because I use                    |
| 45:12      | PushCut as my breakthrough notification system where PushCut should be able to get through              |
| 45:17      | to me in any focus mode.                                                                                |
| 45:19      | And yeah, I also customise my home screen with this because I like to make sure that                    |
| 45:25      | I only see the right apps.                                                                              |
| 45:28      | And another one that I did is I've dimmed my lock screen so that while I'm podcasting,                  |
| 45:33      | I won't see my phone as much.                                                                           |
| 45:37      | I usually have it face down on the table, actually, but it means that the lock screen                   |
| 45:42      | when I see it has this dimmed background.                                                               |
| 45:45      | What about you?                                                                                         |
| 45:46      | Mine is complicated.                                                                                    |
| 45:47      | So I trigger it at this point from a Choose From menu.                                                  |
| 45:51      | And I have three different shortcuts, one for each show that I make.                                    |
| 45:56      | And one of the things it does is trigger the focus mode.                                                |
| 46:00      | And then it also does some other things.                                                                |
| 46:02      | It gives me a list of, it used to be, depends on who's home and with COVID and the way things           |
| 46:08      | have changed, like sometimes I actually have three people here with me.                                 |
| 46:11      | So it creates a text message that goes out to whoever's home saying, hey, I'm podcasting                |
| 46:16      | for the next two and a half hours, which is just a good way to make sure nobody tries                   |
| 46:22      | to do any really bandwidth heavy internet stuff or make a lot of noise.                                 |
| 46:26      | And my family understands when I'm doing a show, they shouldn't be doing those things.                  |
| 46:32      | And that also encourages them to leave me alone for a couple hours.                                     |
| 46:36      | It also changes my watch days.                                                                          |
| 46:38      | I have a red one for automators, a green one for MPU and a blue one for focused.                        |
| 46:43      | I don't know if I really need that, but there's something about like looking at my watch and            |
| 46:48      | saying, I'm recording automators, it's red.                                                             |
| 46:52      | My only thing I should be thinking about right now is automators, not what time it is.                  |
| 46:56      | And I don't know, just like dumb stuff like that actually helps me.                                     |
| 47:00      | In terms of the focus mode itself, this is not one where I allow favourites through.                     |
| 47:07      | Because podcasting is as silly as it sounds, it takes a lot of concentration to make a                  |
| 47:14      | good show.                                                                                              |
| 47:15      | And I don't want just anybody getting through.                                                          |
| 47:17      | So the only people that can get through are my wife, my two kids, [[Rosemary Orchard\|Rose]], [[Mike Schmitz\|Mike]], and [[Stephen Hackett\|Stephen]].              |
| 47:23      | And just like Rose, I thought about trying to make one for each show.                                   |
| 47:27      | So then I could cut out Mike and Stephen, for instance, when I'm recording automators.                  |
| 47:32      | But there's only 10.                                                                                    |
| 47:33      | And I think if I had the ability to make 20 focus modes, I probably would do it.                        |
| 47:39      | Because whatever Mike and Stephen want to talk to me about at this moment, it's not                     |
| 47:42      | as important as me making a good episode of automators.                                                 |
| 47:45      | So I think I would actually have one for each.                                                          |
| 47:48      | I just, the problem for me is numbers.                                                                  |
| 47:49      | I ran out of slots.                                                                                     |
| 47:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 47:51      | I mean, I considered it, but I have occasionally had things where I try to avoid doing back-to-back     |
| 47:57      | podcast recordings unless completely impossible.                                                        |
| 48:00      | It very rarely happens when we have to rearrange things, you know, when any podcast has to              |
| 48:06      | rearrange things.                                                                                       |
| 48:07      | And then I end up doing two on the same day.                                                            |
| 48:09      | And I try to avoid that.                                                                                |
| 48:11      | But for those times or where somebody is basically messaging me and saying, hey, I need to rearrange.   |
| 48:18      | I've had a thing come up, me being able to see that and just get an idea.                               |
| 48:23      | And then during one of the outbreaks, being able to just very quickly reply and say, I'm                |
| 48:27      | podcasting, I'll get back to you afterwards, is helpful because it means that they're not               |
| 48:31      | worrying on the other side, you know, why isn't she responding?                                         |
| 48:35      | She usually responds quickly and so on.                                                                 |
| 48:38      | But yes, I do avoid pretty much everybody else messaging me.                                            |
| 48:43      | Even my mom doesn't get through with focus modes, though she is aware.                                  |
| 48:48      | If there is an actual emergency, I have explained this to my parents and they're both aware             |
| 48:52      | that this is a feature on iOS, calling three times will still get through.                              |
| 48:57      | So that is a good feature, repeated calls will still break through a focus mode, which                  |
| 49:02      | is something that I feel is important because there are a few people out there who might                |
| 49:07      | abuse that.                                                                                             |
| 49:08      | But in general, if there is an emergency, hang up and dial again, hang up and dial again                |
| 49:12      | and you get through.                                                                                    |
| 49:14      | And that is quite useful so that if there's an actual genuine emergency, somebody can                   |
| 49:19      | still get through.                                                                                      |
| 49:21      | But just in general, I try to keep things minimal there.                                                |
| 49:25      | So I don't have hundreds of notifications dinging and buzzing.                                          |
| 49:29      | And the fact that it syncs across my devices means that I'm not getting notifications from              |
| 49:33      | random apps while I'm podcasting as well, because I just haven't let them through.                      |
| 49:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 49:39      | So by letting Daisy through, she's kind of a gatekeeper for me at that point, if something              |
| 49:44      | happened from my extended family and they weren't able to get through to me.                            |
| 49:47      | And I actually do have this turn on where it sends a notification that says, I'm in                     |
| 49:50      | a focus mode, so you can't get through to me.                                                           |
| 49:54      | They could always get a hold of her and then she can, there is a hole in the dike for her               |
| 49:58      | always.                                                                                                 |
| 49:59      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 50:00      | So in terms of the apps, with focus modes, you can also limit apps.                                     |
| 50:04      | The only apps I let through while podcasting are [[Slack]], which is kind of a back-in communication        |
| 50:09      | portal that a lot of times me and podcasters use together while we're making a show.                    |
| 50:15      | So I want to let those through.                                                                         |
| 50:17      | And in fact, during today's show, we got an admin alert from Relay related to our show,                 |
| 50:22      | which I don't mind getting that while recording.                                                        |
| 50:25      | And then of course Zoom, because we record this with Zoom.                                              |
| 50:30      | But there's an option with these apps where you can say some apps have time-sensitive information       |
| 50:35      | like calendar app or different apps have different settings.                                            |
| 50:40      | I turned that off too.                                                                                  |
| 50:41      | I mean, I'm very stingy when podcasting about what gets through to me because this is the               |
| 50:46      | job right now and nothing else is really more important.                                                |
| 50:50      | All of that is triggered with a choose from menu shortcut.                                              |
| 50:53      | Now, someday we're going to do this, I think we'll do a show on our podcasting workflows                |
| 50:58      | because there's a whole bunch more I do on the mat to set everything up.                                |
| 51:02      | And I'd like shortcuts to be able to do that, but it's really just not up to the task yet.              |
| 51:07      | But this is focus mode for podcasting for me.                                                           |
| 51:10      | It's a green pair of headphones and I do wish, kind of getting back to what you said earlier            |
| 51:15      | about there not being a microphone, I wish there were a lot more icons with these focus                 |
| 51:19      | modes.                                                                                                  |
| 51:20      | I feel like whoever did those, he took an early lunch that day.                                         |
| 51:24      | They should have, there should be like three times as many icons.                                       |
| 51:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 51:29      | I also have a bonus hidden feature or fact for people that the briefcase that they use                  |
| 51:36      | for the focus mode icon is not the San Francisco symbol for the briefcase.                              |
| 51:43      | All of the other symbols are San Francisco symbols from Apple's San Francisco symbol                    |
| 51:47      | font.                                                                                                   |
| 51:49      | But that one isn't for whatever reason.                                                                 |
| 51:51      | I don't know why that particular one isn't, but there we go.                                            |
| 51:56      | It would be really nice to have a lot more icons, I have to say, but equally, I'm okay                  |
| 52:02      | with it.                                                                                                |
| 52:03      | And Apple has [[SF Symbols]].                                                                               |
| 52:04      | They have a font family of symbols.                                                                     |
| 52:06      | So it's like, they don't even have to make them again.                                                  |
| 52:09      | Just click more boxes.                                                                                  |
| 52:11      | Give us more.                                                                                           |
| 52:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 52:13      | All right.                                                                                              |
| 52:14      | Give me another focus mode.                                                                             |
| 52:15      | Yeah, so I have a day job, which I rather like, fortunately, and so I have a work focus                 |
| 52:21      | mode for this, and I've allowed people in my work contact group to get through to me,                   |
| 52:26      | and some other people who are in my favourites group, and I've had to manually select those              |
| 52:31      | because you can only select a group for people or one group.                                            |
| 52:37      | It's not multiple groups that you can just blanket allow through.                                       |
| 52:41      | So I did discover during one of the outbreaks that if you go into the people option, then               |
| 52:49      | allow calls from favourites, that one can change to your groups, and then you'll actually                |
| 52:52      | see the group there, and that is going to automatically update, which is really useful.                 |
| 52:57      | So I've made sure that that is my work group.                                                           |
| 53:00      | And I have that automatically turned on at 9 a.m. if I'm at home and turn off at 5 p.m.                 |
| 53:07      | And that does a couple of things.                                                                       |
| 53:09      | It actually sets the thermostat in my office to 18 degrees, and that gets turned back off               |
| 53:16      | when I'm not podcasting for people going, wait a moment, what, Siberia?                                 |
| 53:20      | No, 65 degrees Fahrenheit, give or take.                                                                |
| 53:22      | I try not to overheat things, but yeah, I set the thermostat in my office a little bit                  |
| 53:27      | higher.                                                                                                 |
| 53:28      | I should have mentioned, I do that actually when I'm podcasting as well because I'm going               |
| 53:30      | to be in this room for it.                                                                              |
| 53:33      | So yeah, if I'm at home, my work focus mode turns on, and yeah, that turns off again.                   |
| 53:41      | And it does change my home screen.                                                                      |
| 53:43      | I did experiment with changing my background for this one as well, and decided that was                 |
| 53:46      | a step too far for this particular focus mode.                                                          |
| 53:50      | I don't really need it for that.                                                                        |
| 53:52      | In fact, I found changing my background or changing the wallpaper on my iPhone is something             |
| 53:58      | I do very much enjoy doing, but I don't want to do it as part of a focus mode and have                  |
| 54:03      | it change multiple times a day because that throws me a little bit.                                     |
| 54:06      | The exception being sleep mode, where I very specifically set a black lock screen wallpaper.            |
| 54:13      | Because then I come back to a nice one during the day, and it just means that there is even             |
| 54:19      | less light coming from my phone if I pick it up at night just to see what the time is                   |
| 54:23      | or something else.                                                                                      |
| 54:24      | All right, well, I've got, for dueling work modes, I've got one as well, and this one                   |
| 54:31      | again is triggered off of a shortcut, but like I said, again, I'm going to install                      |
| 54:37      | the beta.                                                                                               |
| 54:38      | If my phone goes up in smoke after today's show, we can blame Rose.                                     |
| 54:42      | That's okay.                                                                                            |
| 54:43      | I mean, one of the things I should say actually, David, is you've just made me realise, mentioning      |
| 54:48      | your podcast modes, that of course I can trigger the focus mode from a shortcut.                        |
| 54:55      | Now the problem is I trigger my podcasting focus mode from the Mac, so I can't change,                  |
| 54:59      | for example, my Apple Watch face, but if I were triggering it from the iPhone, then I                   |
| 55:03      | could change my Apple Watch face and then set the focus mode from there.                                |
| 55:08      | So I might have to experiment with an ask before running option, or maybe I can just                    |
| 55:13      | use the calendar.                                                                                       |
| 55:14      | I can use the calendar to figure out what podcasts I'm recording and change my watch                    |
| 55:17      | face depending on that.                                                                                 |
| 55:18      | I'll figure that out.                                                                                   |
| 55:19      | That's how it worked for me.                                                                            |
| 55:20      | It's a funny point.                                                                                     |
| 55:21      | I mean, you can absolutely trigger these from the Mac, but I found myself triggering these              |
| 55:24      | nearly exclusively from my Choose From Menu shortcuts because it's also triggered, I didn't             |
| 55:30      | mention earlier, I also trigger a timer when I start podcasting the automator, so it's                  |
| 55:35      | a special timer that gets thrown and stuff like that.                                                   |
| 55:38      | One of the things I'm jealous of, because I haven't been able to get the automation                     |
| 55:43      | to trigger based on me setting the focus mode is on the Apple Watch.                                    |
| 55:47      | If you swipe up from the bottom, you can pick any one of your focus modes and trigger it                |
| 55:52      | from your wrist, and I think that is really cool.                                                       |
| 55:54      | And maybe that would be the thing that pushes me over the edge if I have a reliable automation          |
| 56:00      | trigger that says, when I put it in work mode or when I put it in podcast mode, then run                |
| 56:04      | the shortcuts that sends the text message out and sets the timer and does all the stuff                 |
| 56:09      | that I like to do, that would be really cool.                                                           |
| 56:12      | So I'm going to be playing with that as this automation trigger gets more stable.                       |
| 56:17      | But going to work mode, I do have a particular home screen for work mode, and it shows an               |
| 56:24      | OmniFocused view of my work-related tasks for the day, not personal, just work, because                |
| 56:29      | I can do that with a custom perspective.                                                                |
| 56:32      | It shows a version of a Fantastical that gives me a list of my events for the day.                      |
| 56:38      | It puts a lot of my work-related apps right on the screen for me, like [[Slack]], I work in                 |
| 56:44      | a lot, Basecamp, I work in a lot, [[Obsidian]], and then [[Drafts]].                                            |
| 56:47      | So a bunch of apps show up that I generally use for this stuff.                                         |
| 56:52      | And now in terms of the permissions that I give through work mode, this is one where                    |
| 56:58      | I do allow VIPs through.                                                                                |
| 57:00      | If you're a VIP and I'm working, you can still get through to me.                                       |
| 57:04      | So that solves the problem of my wife and my kids and my sisters.                                       |
| 57:08      | They can get a hold of me.                                                                              |
| 57:09      | I don't have to punch a specific hole for them in this wall, because they're always on                  |
| 57:14      | my VIP list.                                                                                            |
| 57:16      | But I also have all the people in my life that are related to work, and just keeping                    |
| 57:21      | this to the MacSparky side of my life, JF Brissette, who's a huge help to me with a lot                  |
| 57:30      | of things I do.                                                                                         |
| 57:31      | Adina does a lot of graphics for me, and Leilani does a lot of virtual assistant stuff.                  |
| 57:37      | I've got Steve and Mike, UTJ, some of the people that work with me, I've carved holes                   |
| 57:42      | for them, and when I'm in work mode, they can get a hold of me.                                         |
| 57:46      | And then in terms, and I also allow favourites, like I said, in terms of apps, I'm more permissive       |
| 57:52      | with apps, OmniFocus, Basecamp, [[Slack]], all the work-related apps, they get through because              |
| 57:59      | I'm doing stuff.                                                                                        |
| 58:00      | Interestingly, I almost never carve holes for messages, because it's always allowing                    |
| 58:05      | messages through by people, not by the app itself.                                                      |
| 58:10      | And I also allow time-sensitive messages when I'm in work mode.                                         |
| 58:15      | This is much less restrictive than what I do with podcasting, because I'm just working,                 |
| 58:19      | it's different from being on a live mic to being working on a contract or writing a blog                |
| 58:25      | post.                                                                                                   |
| 58:26      | Yes, yes.                                                                                               |
| 58:27      | And I think that is the thing, isn't it?                                                                |
| 58:29      | Some of this is about analysing the different hats that we wear, and also to some extent                |
| 58:33      | which hats we aspire to wear, and maybe struggle to do that with, because for example, for              |
| 58:40      | work, I do allow, for example, due to come through as a notification from the application,              |
| 58:46      | because I frequently set due alerts for myself throughout the day based on things that I                |
| 58:50      | need to do.                                                                                             |
| 58:51      | So, for example, after lunch, I need to go and do this thing, put on a load of laundry                  |
| 58:57      | and things like that.                                                                                   |
| 58:58      | It sounds really silly, but I do work from home, and I should be remembering to do things               |
| 59:02      | like that if I have that possibility, and if it doesn't affect my work, of course.                      |
| 59:07      | And so, I've played with these things, and the other thing is, is I've found sometimes                  |
| 59:15      | it's worth sitting back and looking at the end of the day at what notifications came                    |
| 59:19      | through and were silenced during my focus mode, and what things did come through and                    |
| 59:27      | interrupt me, because one that I somehow found that made it into my work focus mode allow               |
| 59:33      | list was eBay.                                                                                          |
| 59:37      | I have no idea how I got in there.                                                                      |
| 59:39      | I think something went very wrong on a beta at some point, because there was eBay and                  |
| 59:43      | something else, I don't even remember what.                                                             |
| 59:45      | And it was sending me notifications for a saved search, and again, a saved search, I                    |
| 59:50      | don't even remember setting up.                                                                         |
| 59:51      | I probably set it up a very long time ago, that's why, but it was one of those things                   |
| 59:56      | where it's like, why is this coming through?                                                            |
| 59:57      | I'm going to go change this.                                                                            |
| 59:58      | And of course, you can't change this from the notifications themselves.                                 |
| 01:00:03   | If you swipe right, there's options.                                                                    |
| 01:00:05   | And you can actually mute a notification or an app for an hour or for today.                            |
| 01:00:10   | But if you go to the settings, then you don't get the option to allow it into a focus mode              |
| 01:00:15   | or not.                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:16   | So you have to go back to the focus mode settings for those to allow them.                              |
| 01:00:20   | But I found some review definitely has helped me with getting these things set up, because              |
| 01:00:25   | it means that I am just more accurate about doing these and enjoying doing these things                 |
| 01:00:34   | as well.                                                                                                |
| 01:00:35   | And I'd add to that, the inverse is also true.                                                          |
| 01:00:38   | If you go at the end of the day and you see one that got silenced, you're like, oh, I                   |
| 01:00:43   | actually would have liked to have received that notification.                                           |
| 01:00:46   | Maybe it's a particular person that you had never thought of to include as an exception                 |
| 01:00:50   | or an app.                                                                                              |
| 01:00:52   | In very little time, you can tune these to really work for you.                                         |
| 01:00:56   | Yes, definitely.                                                                                        |
| 01:00:59   | And that is something that is worth remembering that you, first of all, you're not going to             |
| 01:01:05   | get this perfect right off the bat.                                                                     |
| 01:01:07   | And secondly, you can tune it as you go.                                                                |
| 01:01:08   | It's very easy to tune as you go.                                                                       |
| 01:01:11   | And I really like that.                                                                                 |
| 01:01:13   | One of the things that you realised earlier, David, with you, you made me realise earlier,              |
| 01:01:18   | sorry, with your Disneyland podcast, is I have a fitness focus mode.                                    |
| 01:01:23   | And this is one of the, I don't think it's a default one, but it's one of those sort                    |
| 01:01:28   | of recommended ones that Apple will let you set up.                                                     |
| 01:01:32   | And the fitness focus mode, I've just added the location of my ballet studio to it.                     |
| 01:01:38   | Because whenever I go to my ballet studio, I'm only going there for ballet.                             |
| 01:01:41   | I don't go there for anything else.                                                                     |
| 01:01:42   | So I want my fitness focus mode and that will set my watch face for me.                                 |
| 01:01:48   | Which is ideal.                                                                                         |
| 01:01:49   | And then when I leave, it will turn off my fitness focus mode, which has my watch face                  |
| 01:01:52   | back to my usual preferred watch face.                                                                  |
| 01:01:56   | And yeah, that's something that I realised, hang on a minute, this is really useful.                    |
| 01:02:02   | And honestly, with my fitness focus mode, I have just got my favourites in there.                        |
| 01:02:09   | And I've got push cut again for certain notifications for home-based things that I might need to        |
| 01:02:14   | push through.                                                                                           |
| 01:02:15   | I probably won't be getting any of those while I'm doing ballet, but it is really nice to               |
| 01:02:23   | just have the calls from favourites.                                                                     |
| 01:02:26   | So if somebody's calling me and they're in my favourites, they'll get through.                           |
| 01:02:29   | And that's pretty much it.                                                                              |
| 01:02:32   | This episode of Automators is brought to you by In Good Companies from Cadence Bank.                      |
| 01:02:36   | Small and mid-sized businesses are how people turn their passions into their livelihood.                |
| 01:02:40   | But owning a business comes with a whole host of questions.                                             |
| 01:02:43   | How do I get started?                                                                                   |
| 01:02:45   | What type of business owners write for me?                                                              |
| 01:02:46   | How do federal reserve policies affect my business?                                                     |
| 01:02:49   | And when should I create a succession plan?                                                             |
| 01:02:52   | That's where Cadence Bank can help.                                                                     |
| 01:02:54   | On their podcast, In Good Companies, they put together their extensive knowledge to guide                 |
| 01:02:57   | you through the lifecycle of a business from start to sale.                                             |
| 01:03:00   | If you have a business or think you're starting one, this podcast will give you the strategies          |
| 01:03:04   | to help you navigate opportunities and the financial and managerial tools you'll need.                  |
| 01:03:08   | I listened to the episode on new beginnings, getting ready to start your business.                      |
| 01:03:13   | And I've really found it incredibly helpful and a really good reminder to hear how they                 |
| 01:03:18   | were talking about business creation as an analogy to a marathon, not a sprint.                         |
| 01:03:23   | Because I'm sure most of us, when we get started on something new, get excited, sink                    |
| 01:03:27   | in all of our energy and realise we're still quite a long way from completion.                          |
| 01:03:31   | And so seeing what they've got mapped out and how they put it together, so it is more                   |
| 01:03:37   | like a marathon, is incredibly useful.                                                                  |
| 01:03:40   | I think you'd enjoy this podcast if you are planning on starting your own business.                     |
| 01:03:43   | You have your own business or you've got a family or friends who are starting a business                |

| 01:04:29   | All right, so we've got through two each.                                                               |
| 01:04:32   | We both have a lot.                                                                                     |
| 01:04:34   | Let's start going through some more of them.                                                            |
| 01:04:38   | One of my favourites is reading mode.                                                                    |
| 01:04:41   | And you talked about it earlier.                                                                        |
| 01:04:43   | You can trigger this.                                                                                   |
| 01:04:44   | Like for me, one of the triggers for this is if I open the Kindle Lab because I read                    |
| 01:04:48   | a lot in the Kindle Lab.                                                                                |
| 01:04:49   | And so that brings it up.                                                                               |
| 01:04:52   | But this is a fairly, it's fairly permissive on people for me.                                          |
| 01:04:58   | Like all my family and my key podcast partners get through.                                             |
| 01:05:02   | And in fact, now that I look at this, I actually could just turn this one off with all I could          |
| 01:05:06   | just allow VIPs and nobody else and it would work the same way.                                         |
| 01:05:10   | You know, sometimes there's more than one way to scratch a cat.                                         |
| 01:05:15   | And then the other thing is in terms of apps, I don't allow any app notifications, but I                |
| 01:05:21   | do allow time sensitive app notifications.                                                              |
| 01:05:24   | Like if I'm reading, I don't want [[Slack]] messages coming through unless it's from you, you know,         |
| 01:05:30   | or a message.                                                                                           |
| 01:05:31   | So, so this one is kind of permissive in some ways and less permissive in other ways.                   |
| 01:05:36   | I've got a really cool home screen when I do this, though, I really like the way that                   |
| 01:05:41   | home screen came out here.                                                                              |
| 01:05:42   | Let me turn it on so I can just show you.                                                               |
| 01:05:44   | Maybe we'll figure out a way to share some of these home screens.                                       |
| 01:05:47   | But I've got the audible Kindle, I've got [[Obsidian]] and [[Day One]] here, because I actually take            |
| 01:05:55   | notes sometimes on books in different contexts.                                                         |
| 01:05:57   | I've got the [[Apple Books]] app.                                                                           |
| 01:05:58   | Do you know the [[Apple Books]] app does not have a widget?                                                 |
| 01:06:01   | How crazy is that?                                                                                      |
| 01:06:02   | Apple, Apple makes the [[Apple Books]] app, it does not have a widget.                                      |
| 01:06:06   | And then I've got a widget for reader, although I don't, you really use reading mode and reader         |
| 01:06:13   | that often, my RSS stuff, but the main thing I do with this, the screen is Kindle.                      |
| 01:06:19   | And then I take a lot of notes on books I read.                                                         |
| 01:06:21   | So I'm really happy with this one.                                                                      |
| 01:06:25   | And again, just having my home screen light up with just those apps really helps.                       |
| 01:06:30   | We didn't mention earlier that these home screens are device-based, even though you can share           |
| 01:06:36   | these focus modes across devices.                                                                       |
| 01:06:38   | So on the iPad, I have a different home screen that's related to reading mode, and that one             |
| 01:06:44   | triggers, I use a bigger version of the Kindle widget, for instance, on the iPad.                       |
| 01:06:48   | But you can set them up for each device, and it's a little labor-intensive, but it doesn't              |
| 01:06:54   | take that much, and it brings me joy and delight, so I would recommend giving it a shot.                |
| 01:06:59   | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:00   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:07:01   | I do pretty much the same thing.                                                                        |
| 01:07:02   | I've been experimenting recently with the personal focus mode, which Shortcuts ships                    |
| 01:07:07   | with, this is one of the default ones that will just sit in the list and say, set up                    |
| 01:07:11   | next to it, if you haven't set it up yet.                                                               |
| 01:07:13   | And I've been playing with this a little bit versus the standard, do not disturb.                       |
| 01:07:18   | And I found that both of them are the kind of thing that I will turn on for an hour or                  |
| 01:07:23   | until I leave this location, and I'll trigger that usually from Control Centre, where if                |
| 01:07:27   | you tap and hold on it, then you can tap on the three dots next to something next to                    |
| 01:07:33   | working focus modes.                                                                                    |
| 01:07:35   | And that will let you go to the settings, and you can say, turn this on for an hour                     |
| 01:07:38   | until tomorrow morning, until I leave this location, or if there's a calendar event currently           |
| 01:07:42   | running until the end of this event.                                                                    |
| 01:07:45   | And I've been using both of them for that.                                                              |
| 01:07:47   | I've found, do not disturb is great if I'm just trying to, I just really want to just                   |
| 01:07:52   | concentrate on some things and not have anything get through to me for like an hour or so,              |
| 01:07:56   | and then I can come back and get, you know, let interruptions come back into my life.                   |
| 01:08:02   | And Personal is a slightly more permissive version of that, where in general, I don't                   |
| 01:08:07   | want any notifications, but I guess if you're one of this very select group of people, I'll             |
| 01:08:11   | let you through.                                                                                        |
| 01:08:13   | But other than that, it's basically just for rows needs to actually get on and do some                  |
| 01:08:17   | things around the house.                                                                                |
| 01:08:18   | Like I was replacing a light switch the other day and my phone started buzzing and I was                |
| 01:08:22   | like, okay, no, personal focus mode done next.                                                          |
| 01:08:25   | Well, and that is a great candidate for the off hours focus mode.                                       |
| 01:08:31   | You know, we talked earlier about the problem of, well, you know, you can let work messages             |
| 01:08:36   | through, but when you turn off focus modes, all work messages come through anyway, where                |
| 01:08:40   | if you had a personal focus mode, you could turn off, you know, you could make it so you                |
| 01:08:46   | don't get work messages when you're in personal time.                                                   |
| 01:08:49   | My problem with that is that you can't default applications into that.                                  |
| 01:08:53   | So if I install something new and I'm trying it out, then the notifications will get silenced           |
| 01:08:58   | by that automatically, which is good and bad.                                                           |
| 01:09:03   | But in general, I found most of the time I don't need focus modes, I've been pretty                     |
| 01:09:07   | good at actually cranking down the number of notifications I can and do get at various                  |
| 01:09:11   | times.                                                                                                  |
| 01:09:12   | Going back to what you mentioned at the beginning with the base cam feature, the [[Slack]] has that         |
| 01:09:16   | too, where you can say, don't send me notifications outside of these hours.                             |
| 01:09:20   | And I've got that set up in all of my slacks.                                                           |
| 01:09:23   | And actually on my iPhone and iPad, another tip for people, [[Slack]] has two applications.                 |
| 01:09:30   | [[Slack]] EMM, which is the enterprise mode and [[Slack]].                                                      |
| 01:09:33   | So if like me, you're in lots of slacks because, you know, various development groups, for              |
| 01:09:37   | example, may or may not use [[Slack]] for some of their core users to get feedback on things                |
| 01:09:43   | and try things out and let certain users communicate with one another.                                  |
| 01:09:46   | I've put those in the regular [[Slack]] application, and then the slacks that are really important          |
| 01:09:51   | where I definitely want to just be able to whitelist [[Slack]] if I know that I need to be                  |
| 01:09:55   | able to get all notifications from that.                                                                |
| 01:09:58   | Then I have those in the [[Slack]] EMM app.                                                                 |
| 01:10:01   | So for example, relays in there, as is my day job, but my day job, the [[Slack]] settings are               |
| 01:10:06   | no notifications outside of pretty much core working hours.                                             |
| 01:10:09   | Yeah, I'm glad you have that turned on because you and I are so far apart.                              |
| 01:10:13   | I have ideas that I slack you and I always want to make sure I'm not like waking you                    |
| 01:10:16   | up at two in the morning, so please keep that turned on.                                                |
| 01:10:19   | Yeah, I keep that turned on and I am very careful about what notifications I'll let                     |
| 01:10:24   | through.                                                                                                |
| 01:10:25   | If you did call me at 3 a.m., then you would get through because you're one of those people             |
| 01:10:28   | that's allowed to call me.                                                                              |
| 01:10:29   | Wow, power.                                                                                             |
| 01:10:30   | And you have actually had to do that once.                                                              |
| 01:10:31   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:10:32   | When I thought you were lost.                                                                           |
| 01:10:34   | Yes, yes.                                                                                               |
| 01:10:35   | You thought I had been abducted on a plane.                                                             |
| 01:10:37   | It turns out that I was on a plane the next day, not the day everybody thought.                         |
| 01:10:40   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:10:41   | There was some miscommunication there.                                                                  |
| 01:10:42   | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 01:10:43   | There was a day where Salsa Goyen and David Sparks thought we'd lost Rosemary Orchard                   |
| 01:10:47   | and it was a very scary day.                                                                            |
| 01:10:49   | It was a scary day, but you hadn't lost me.                                                             |
| 01:10:52   | But if I've been using sleep focus mode, then I could have actually said, but don't                     |
| 01:10:55   | let David Sparks through, but I don't.                                                                  |
| 01:10:58   | My sleep focus mode is essentially dim the phone down.                                                  |
| 01:11:01   | I do actually have a sleep background or sorry, sleep home screen, which is an empty home               |
| 01:11:07   | screen.                                                                                                 |
| 01:11:08   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:11:09   | It just gives me my dock icons because your dock icons will never change with your home                 |
| 01:11:15   | screen changes, but it just gives me an empty home screen.                                              |
| 01:11:18   | So I won't easily tap into certain applications while I'm sleeping.                                     |
| 01:11:22   | I just, I don't have that.                                                                              |
| 01:11:25   | I don't have those options and it does change my wallpaper to black for me, but I pretty                |
| 01:11:30   | much other than that left it as default.                                                                |
| 01:11:31   | All right.                                                                                              |
| 01:11:32   | So a couple of things I want to follow up on.                                                           |
| 01:11:34   | First of all, you mentioned do not disturb.                                                             |
| 01:11:36   | One of the advantages with this new focus mode is you can actually hack do not disturb.                 |
| 01:11:41   | Like I do not disturb now, Daisy, Sarah and Samantha can all get ahold of me even on do                 |
| 01:11:46   | not disturb.                                                                                            |
| 01:11:47   | So my family can reach me anytime and that makes it easier for me to press the do not                   |
| 01:11:52   | disturb button.                                                                                         |
| 01:11:53   | Cause you know, when you have a wife and kids, if something happens where they need you,                |
| 01:11:58   | you don't ever want to not be there for them.                                                           |
| 01:12:00   | So, so you can actually hack do not disturb.                                                            |
| 01:12:03   | I'd recommend checking that out if you're interested, um, sleep mode, I do as well.                     |
| 01:12:08   | I have that one.                                                                                        |
| 01:12:09   | I'm using the apples sleep mode feature where it turns on at 1030 and stays on until 630.               |
| 01:12:15   | I have a specific home screen for that as well.                                                         |
| 01:12:17   | Um, actually, let me just kind of go over there.                                                        |
| 01:12:20   | There's certain people that I let through of course, you know, same thing and it's largely              |
| 01:12:25   | personal.                                                                                               |
| 01:12:26   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:12:27   | And then I, the home screen I use for it is, is a little more, um, inclusive than what                  |
| 01:12:32   | Rosemary has done, um, for me with sleep mode, let me just turn on so I can see it here.                |
| 01:12:38   | Um, I have a couple of things.                                                                          |
| 01:12:40   | I have the widget of the clock because sometimes if I wake up in the night, I'll see, well,             |
| 01:12:46   | what is it?                                                                                             |
| 01:12:47   | I have a widget of the weather.                                                                         |
| 01:12:50   | So if I wake up, I can see what the weather is like, is it raining right now?                           |
| 01:12:53   | You know, it happens so rarely.                                                                         |
| 01:12:55   | Um, I have a display, a battery widget, which just tells me how the battery is on things.               |
| 01:13:01   | And then I have the, a big button for the [[Drafts]] inbox because, you know, sometimes                     |
| 01:13:06   | I wake up at the middle light and my brain is racing with an idea and I just have to                    |
| 01:13:11   | get it out of my brain so I can go back to sleep.                                                       |
| 01:13:13   | And I found the easiest way to do that is just open [[Drafts]] and dictate or type in a                     |
| 01:13:18   | quick note.                                                                                             |
| 01:13:19   | Daisy's a deep sleeper, so it doesn't bother her either way.                                            |
| 01:13:22   | And then I can go back to sleep.                                                                        |
| 01:13:23   | So I've, it's like in case of emergency, press button inbox to [[Drafts]], you know, and                    |
| 01:13:29   | all right.                                                                                              |
| 01:13:30   | You've given me an idea here, David.                                                                    |
| 01:13:31   | I'm officially modifying my, um, my, my sleep, um, uh, home screen right now, right at the              |
| 01:13:38   | second, because one of the things that, uh, happened to me on Monday this week, um, was                 |
| 01:13:43   | I woke up and I was genuinely confused about what day it was.                                           |
| 01:13:47   | It kind of felt like it was still Sunday.                                                               |
| 01:13:49   | Um, and to compound this confusion, my upstairs neighbour who drives to work and works a nine            |
| 01:13:55   | till five job is apparently on holiday this week because I went to the kitchen and his                  |
| 01:13:59   | car was there, um, and that meant that I, I, I asked a HomePod and then I Googled what                 |
| 01:14:04   | day of the week it was just to be sure that my HomePod, my phone, um, the neighbour's                   |
| 01:14:08   | car weren't lying to me.                                                                                |
| 01:14:09   | Um, so, uh, yeah, I had to double check and that happens every so often where I wake up                 |
| 01:14:14   | and I'm like, Oh gosh, what, what time is it?                                                           |
| 01:14:16   | Like, is it really that time?                                                                           |
| 01:14:17   | So I'm adding an inbox button for [[Drafts]] and I'm going to add the clock, um, as well                    |
| 01:14:23   | to my, um,                                                                                              |
| 01:14:24   | The clock isn't going to tell you what day it is though.                                                |
| 01:14:26   | You're going to put a calendar on this.                                                                 |
| 01:14:27   | If I add the clock and a calendar, then I can, I can, uh, do that.                                      |
| 01:14:32   | Uh, I may end up actually using widget pack and just adding a medium sized widget that                  |
| 01:14:36   | just says the day of the week and updating that every day at midnight.                                  |
| 01:14:39   | Um, that, that's probably the way I'm going to go with that actually.                                   |
| 01:14:42   | So I will put that on my list of things to do after the show because I think that one's                 |
| 01:14:46   | going to take a few more minutes than, uh, just, uh, something that I can quickly add                   |
| 01:14:50   | [[Drafts]] to that screen while, uh, while we're on the air, but yes, uh, it's really useful.               |
| 01:14:55   | Um, the other thing I have on it is a, as a Kindle widget.                                              |
| 01:14:58   | So I can, if I wake up and I feel like I'm just not going to go back to sleep, I can                    |
| 01:15:01   | read a book for a little while and, um, um, and if worse comes worse, I'll just get out                 |
| 01:15:07   | of bed and work.                                                                                        |
| 01:15:08   | I mean, once I wake up, if I can't go back to sleep, I, I don't hang around a long time.                |
| 01:15:12   | But anyway, that's, that's sleep.                                                                       |
| 01:15:14   | Um, a couple of others here, um, I've got, I mentioned the Disneyland one earlier and                   |
| 01:15:20   | that's just because that's a place my family and I go, we go there like once a week and                 |
| 01:15:23   | I wanted to have a real simple thing there.                                                             |
| 01:15:26   | And I also didn't want to be interrupted by clients, you know, I mean, if you're there                  |
| 01:15:30   | with your family, um, that is truly family time.                                                        |
| 01:15:34   | So I've got a, a, um, a focus mode that's very restrictive about work related contacts,                 |
| 01:15:40   | although Rosemary can always contact me.                                                                |
| 01:15:42   | Rosemary.                                                                                               |
| 01:15:43   | Thank you.                                                                                              |
| 01:15:44   | Um, and, and this is one where I let VIPs through, you know, because I think it makes                   |
| 01:15:48   | sense, you know, um, if, uh, someone's on a VIP, let's just cause you're having a Disneyland,           |
| 01:15:53   | you should be able, they should be able to get ahold of you.                                            |
| 01:15:56   | Um, the big use of this one really, I think more than the, the notification limitation                  |
| 01:16:02   | is the home screen, you know, because there's all this stuff you do when you're at Disneyland           |
| 01:16:08   | where you need a completely different home screen and I, so I, I do that like the home                  |
| 01:16:14   | screen for Disneyland has the, the current day weather and a larger size widget as a                    |
| 01:16:19   | medium sized widget, but it gives me hourly weather. So if I get rain coming in or whatever             |
| 01:16:25   | battery status really matters when you're there because you're burning up a lot of                      |
| 01:16:31   | battery, you take pictures and all that.                                                                |
| 01:16:33   | And with the Apple, I even have the Apple magnetic battery.                                             |
| 01:16:36   | I wanted to see what the status of that is when I plug it in.                                           |
| 01:16:39   | So I have the small size battery widget that shows me the status of my watch phone and                  |
| 01:16:44   | battery. I've got again, the clock widget, which is weird, right?                                       |
| 01:16:48   | But it's really good being able to just look down and see what time it is. And then I've                |
| 01:16:52   | got a series of apps that I only use a lot at Disneyland, you know, photos, [[Instagram]],                  |
| 01:16:57   | the camera app is on my home screen. I never put the camera app on my home screen, but                  |
| 01:17:00   | I put it there when I'm at Disneyland and then at Disneyland these days, everything                     |
| 01:17:04   | runs on their app. So I've got the Disneyland app, their messages and the phone so I can                |
| 01:17:10   | get ahold of my family when we're there, but it's just a different context, you know, so                |
| 01:17:15   | the home screen changes. And now with Rose's great advice, it's going to happen automatically           |
| 01:17:20   | when I get there and leave, but it's not hard to know that I'm in the Disneyland focus mode             |
| 01:17:25   | after I leave, because I just opened my home screen and it's all the Disneyland stuff.                  |
| 01:17:28   | So I can switch it back easily enough, but I'd like to automate that.                                   |
| 01:17:32   | You got another one?                                                                                    |
| 01:17:33   | Yes. So aside from those ones, there's also the driving one. Now I have set this up. So                 |
| 01:17:40   | one of the features you can use with these focus mode automations, depending on which                   |
| 01:17:44   | one it is. For example, fitness will has an option to turn on and off automatically when                |
| 01:17:50   | you start and end a workout. And you don't have to enable that. Driving can also activate               |
| 01:17:55   | when connected to car Bluetooth automatically with Carplay or manually. And I've set this               |
| 01:18:00   | up for manually because actually most of the time when I'm driving, I'm driving somewhere               |
| 01:18:06   | not very far away and I do want people to be able to get in touch with me and the announce              |
| 01:18:10   | notifications feature is amazing. However, I still have the driving focus mode. It turns                |
| 01:18:16   | off notifications from people. It only allows calls through from my favourites and some                 |
| 01:18:23   | other people. And I turn that on manually if I need it. And that means if I'm driving                   |
| 01:18:32   | somewhere further away or somewhere I don't know where I'm going, then I will turn that                 |
| 01:18:36   | on to help me focus more on my driving. But if it's five minutes down the road to the                   |
| 01:18:41   | supermarket, the chances are I'm not going to get a notification in that time period                    |
| 01:18:45   | anyway. So I'm fine without enabling that automatically because it means that I won't                   |
| 01:18:50   | miss something should something interesting or important happen. And I will then be able                |
| 01:18:55   | to deal with it immediately. But yeah, I turn on the focus mode. I use the watch for that               |
| 01:19:01   | one as well. If you are in a focus mode on your watch and you swipe up, if you tap and                  |
| 01:19:05   | hold, then you can jump straight into another focus mode. Because I do do that at times.                |
| 01:19:09   | I switch straight from one focus mode to another. I don't disable it first.                             |
| 01:19:13   | Yeah. Yeah, that works. And I actually have the driving one turned on automatically where               |
| 01:19:19   | it just when it thinks I'm driving, which is kind of funny if I'm riding my bike fast,                  |
| 01:19:24   | it thinks I'm driving. If I'm in the passenger seat, it thinks I'm driving. But I don't mind            |
| 01:19:29   | that. And honestly, anytime I can get less notifications is a win for me. So I've got                   |
| 01:19:36   | my notifications pretty well cranked down so that I'm not going to be getting unimportant               |
| 01:19:40   | things while driving because I've one of the things focus modes has made me do is look                  |
| 01:19:45   | at the notifications I'm getting. And I've changed a lot of them to default to the lock                 |
| 01:19:48   | screen rather than sending me a notification. They'll appear on the lock screen. So I'll                |
| 01:19:53   | see them when I review, but they're not going to interrupt what I'm doing. And that that                |
| 01:19:59   | has been a really good side effect of getting into focus modes with all of the automations              |
| 01:20:05   | as part of that, because it means that I've looked at these things with a more critical                 |
| 01:20:08   | eye and realised how many things were interrupting me or bothering me that I perhaps had ignored        |
| 01:20:14   | up until now.                                                                                           |
| 01:20:15   | I've also got one called deep focus. And as I'm looking at it here, it's really not                     |
| 01:20:19   | much different than do not disturb. I let my family through and I just a couple apps.                   |
| 01:20:24   | And sometimes, you know, Cal Newport wrote a book years ago called deep focus that really               |
| 01:20:30   | I think is a great book. And the idea of it is like we get, you know, between two and                   |
| 01:20:36   | four hours a day of actual work done. And I really like to have time during the day                     |
| 01:20:41   | where nobody can interrupt me and I can really just dial in on something. And so deep focus             |
| 01:20:48   | is there for that. And I also have one called screen casting, which is exactly what it                  |
| 01:20:54   | sounds like. It's a bunch of settings when I'm screen casting, because it's different                   |
| 01:20:58   | kinds of notifications I need while screen casting. But largely, I don't want a lot of                  |
| 01:21:03   | notifications coming in because a lot of times screen casting on the actual device. So that's           |
| 01:21:08   | a very kind of industry specific focus mode. But once you start adding these up, you can                |
| 01:21:13   | see I filled up 10 pretty quickly. I think one of my complaints is I'd like to have more.               |
| 01:21:18   | Yeah, I feel like 10 is just some arbitrary number that somebody somewhere said, yeah,                  |
| 01:21:22   | sure, let's set a maximum of, I don't know, 10. And it kind of stuck. And I feel, you                   |
| 01:21:28   | know, for a lot of people, sure, they're probably going, well, I guess between, say, work and           |
| 01:21:34   | school and family time, sleeping, driving, yeah, let's swap five. But I feel like maybe                 |
| 01:21:43   | you should be experiment with different kinds of work, like you have your deep focus. I'm               |
| 01:21:48   | going to be adding work meetings, which will crank down even further the number of notifications        |
| 01:21:53   | I get while in a work meeting. And I'll just enable that for an hour. And when that disables,           |
| 01:21:59   | it'll I'm going to set up an automation for this, you do have to do these automations                   |
| 01:22:05   | on your phone, you can't do them on your Mac. But that's fine, because my phone is always               |
| 01:22:09   | on, even if it's not necessarily with me. And when I disable my work meeting, then it                   |
| 01:22:15   | will check whether or not I'm still within work time. And if it is, then it'll turn                     |
| 01:22:19   | on my work focus mode again for me. So I'll go straight from work meeting to work focus                 |
| 01:22:25   | mode, unless it's the end of the day, which occasionally happens. So yeah, I think it's                 |
| 01:22:33   | worth experimenting with these things a little bit. And also, you know, purely from the different       |
| 01:22:38   | home screens perspective, even if you, I don't know, regularly went to Disneyland, and or               |
| 01:22:45   | say, for example, you live in Florida, you regularly go to Disney World and Universal,                  |
| 01:22:49   | you shouldn't necessarily create a generic theme parks focus mode, you should probably                  |
| 01:22:55   | look at two, because you'll want different applications in different places. And so having              |
| 01:23:00   | different home screens for that makes perfect sense. And also, I feel like maybe it would               |
| 01:23:05   | be kind of against the rules to have a Disney app on your home screen when you're in Universal.         |
| 01:23:09   | I don't know. It probably isn't. Nobody's going to tell you off, but it just feels                      |
| 01:23:12   | kind of wrong, right? Maybe your phone would just catch on fire. You just don't know. Possibly,         |
| 01:23:17   | possibly, possibly. I do, though, I really don't want to understate the impact of having                |
| 01:23:22   | these home screens change and putting the time in to make custom home screens, because                  |
| 01:23:27   | yeah, you know, contextual computing is something I'm never going to stop talking about. But            |
| 01:23:33   | anytime you can get your computer to give your brain a nudge to do the kind of work                     |
| 01:23:38   | you're supposed to be doing at that moment, it is a win. And this is really doesn't take                |
| 01:23:44   | that long to set these up. And, you know, I guess what I'd like to say is we're kind                    |
| 01:23:50   | of getting towards the end here is that these focus modes can be as simple or complex as                |
| 01:23:55   | you want. Rosemary and I have done some that are super complex, but you start out making                |
| 01:23:59   | some simple ones. You can trigger them very easily. You can go all the way down the automation          |
| 01:24:05   | rabbit hole if you want, or you can just open up the control centre and hit the button.                 |
| 01:24:10   | But either way, I think this stuff is great. And they are, by their very nature, automation             |
| 01:24:16   | friendly because they're automating things, you know, like it would be so difficult to                  |
| 01:24:21   | go in and change notification settings every time you go from working on your day job to,               |
| 01:24:27   | you know, wanting to be, you know, a gamer or going to ballet, right?                                   |
| 01:24:31   | Yeah. I heard Gray talking about this very problem on [[Cortex]] a while ago, and then focus                |
| 01:24:37   | modes came along and that pretty much solved the problem for him. And I feel, you know,                 |
| 01:24:42   | a lot of us can do with without certain notifications at certain times of day. So it's great that       |
| 01:24:48   | we now have this as an option. And also that they built so much automation into the focus               |
| 01:24:54   | mode settings themselves with the turning on and off and so on, because that is really                  |
| 01:25:00   | critical for people who are just getting started. Being able to do this without having to open          |
| 01:25:04   | the shortcuts app even is really great. And then, you know, once you've dipped your toe                 |
| 01:25:09   | in the water, by all means, open up the shortcuts app and have a play there too.                        |
| 01:25:13   | And here's the selfish part. When you're done figuring this out, you need to go to talk.automators.fm   |
| 01:25:18   | and tell us the cool ones, because we want to steal them. That's really why we just made                |
| 01:25:25   | this show. So we want to hear what you're doing too.                                                    |
| 01:25:27   | Yes. Yes. You know, you can be a good artist or you can be a great artist and steal, and                |
| 01:25:33   | we love sharing all of our ideas with each other so everybody can steal from each other.                |
| 01:25:37   | And that is one of the many things that you can do in the Automated Forum, including asking             |
| 01:25:41   | for help if you get stuck on things or sharing cool things that you've created with any kind            |
| 01:25:45   | of automation application or solution. In the meantime, we are the Automators. We appreciate            |
| 01:25:51   | you listening to the show. We'll be back in a couple of weeks. We want to thank our sponsors.           |
| 01:25:55   | It's our friends at Smile, Hunter Douglas, and In Good Companies from Cadence Bank. We'll                |
| 01:26:00   | see you next time. Goodbye.                                                                             |
