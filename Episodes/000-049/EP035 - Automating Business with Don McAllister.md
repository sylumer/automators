| 00:00      | Hello and welcome to Automators.                                                                       |
| 00:04      | My name is Rosemary Orchard and I am here today with David Sparks and a very special                   |
| 00:08      | guest.                                                                                                 |
| 00:09      | Hello, David Sparks.                                                                                   |
| 00:10      | Hello, Rosemary Orchard.                                                                               |
| 00:11      | How are you today?                                                                                     |
| 00:12      | Well, I'm excited.                                                                                     |
| 00:14      | We are going to be talking to Don McAllister today.                                                    |
| 00:17      | Welcome to the show, Don.                                                                              |
| 00:18      | Oh, thank you very much for having me.                                                                 |
| 00:20      | It's good to be here.                                                                                  |
| 00:23      | So Don and I go back a long way.                                                                       |
| 00:25      | Don, I don't know how long we've been friends, but...                                                  |
| 00:27      | Oh, it goes back a very long way, yeah.                                                                |
| 00:31      | Yeah, at least over 10 years now.                                                                      |
| 00:33      | Oh, at least.                                                                                          |
| 00:34      | But you also are working with Rosemary these days.                                                     |
| 00:37      | Ros is doing some of the videos for you over at Screencast Online.                                     |
| 00:40      | That's right.                                                                                          |
| 00:41      | Yeah, we've just welcomed Rosemary to the fold.                                                        |
| 00:42      | So yeah, she's done us a fantastic iOS 13 Deeper Dive show for us and she's doing a couple             |
| 00:49      | more.                                                                                                  |
| 00:50      | So that's good.                                                                                        |
| 00:51      | That's awesome.                                                                                        |
| 00:52      | So the thing about Don that people don't know is that Don is a super high-level automation             |
| 00:59      | nerd.                                                                                                  |
| 01:00      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                              |
| 01:01      | Yeah, and he brings it in a way that's interesting because he's running a business.                    |
| 01:04      | Don has a lot of people helping him out with getting his videos produced like Ros.                     |
| 01:08      | And he's got to manage all of that.                                                                    |
| 01:10      | And he's bringing his automation prowess to the table.                                                 |
| 01:13      | And I thought it would be a great opportunity to talk to you about that today, Don.                    |
| 01:17      | Yeah, sure.                                                                                            |
| 01:18      | I mean, it's built up over the years.                                                                  |
| 01:20      | Obviously, when I started off Screencast Online, it was just me.                                       |
| 01:24      | I did everything basically, you know, the creation of the content and the post-production              |
| 01:28      | and the websites.                                                                                      |
| 01:30      | But over the years, because it's been running now, I think it's been 12, 13 years now it's             |
| 01:33      | been running.                                                                                          |
| 01:34      | Obviously, I've brought more people on board because it's doing a show, well, two shows                |
| 01:40      | every week.                                                                                            |
| 01:41      | It's quite an ask, really.                                                                             |
| 01:42      | And there's a lot of work involved behind the scenes.                                                  |
| 01:45      | And obviously, for one person to do that for like 13 years, I'd have gone crazy by now.                |
| 01:49      | So yeah, I've sort of been bringing more people on board and sort of outsourcing some bits             |
| 01:54      | of the production process to different people.                                                         |
| 01:55      | And the need to be a way of, well, automating it to make things standardised, but also to              |
| 02:01      | control the process flows as the various shows go through the different stages of production.          |
| 02:07      | Of course, you know, we've got shows at all different stages of production.                            |
| 02:10      | So I needed some way to sort of automate that and keep track of it.                                    |
| 02:14      | I was going to say, one of the things that you said, you know, you've built this up                    |
| 02:16      | over the years.                                                                                        |
| 02:17      | And I think that's something that everybody should bear in mind with all automations,                  |
| 02:20      | isn't it?                                                                                              |
| 02:21      | You know, you don't start day one with a perfect automation that everything goes wonderfully.          |
| 02:27      | And so it's really good to, I find, start with a simpler automation.                                   |
| 02:32      | And then you see very, very quickly how you can enhance upon this and build it up and make             |
| 02:37      | it do all these other things for you.                                                                  |
| 02:39      | But you have to start with one small step.                                                             |
| 02:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 02:42      | That's right.                                                                                          |
| 02:43      | You can't...                                                                                           |
| 02:44      | I mean, as we discussed some of the things that I've built up over the years, you know,                |
| 02:46      | people might start scratching their heads thinking, well, goodness me, how do we even                  |
| 02:48      | start?                                                                                                 |
| 02:49      | But as you say, you've got to start with just a small byte and then build on top of that.              |
| 02:54      | And what I find is as you start automating things, it gives you ideas for other things                 |
| 02:58      | as well.                                                                                               |
| 02:59      | So you sort of build on and then if you're lucky, you can sort of integrate some of that               |
| 03:02      | together to build up these larger workflows.                                                           |
| 03:05      | You really have evolved this over the years too, because I remember you've gone through                |
| 03:08      | several different platforms and systems, but it seems like you're pretty happy where you're            |
| 03:13      | at now.                                                                                                |
| 03:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 03:15      | I mean, originally we started off, the website was based on Rapid Weaver and that was just             |
| 03:21      | something I sort of cobbled together, but there was a lot of manual input in creating                  |
| 03:24      | the shows, whereas now it's sort of like a bespoke platform for the website.                           |
| 03:28      | So it's all built on a [[SQL]] database.                                                                   |
| 03:31      | So we don't actually create the show pages.                                                            |
| 03:33      | We basically fill in templates or automatically now fill in templates and the information              |
| 03:38      | that we put into the system is used to dynamically create the web pages.                               |
| 03:42      | So there's lots of things, lots of streamlining like that where it used to be manual processes.        |
| 03:48      | We've now automated it, even written bespoke code to do some of the more esoteric bits                 |
| 03:53      | and pieces.                                                                                            |
| 03:54      | Nice.                                                                                                  |
| 03:55      | Well, Don, when did you first get interested in automation?                                            |
| 04:00      | Well, probably back before the screencasts online days, I mean, I've been in IT for quite              |
| 04:04      | a while.                                                                                               |
| 04:05      | I used to work for a corporate IT company and used to be involved in remote support                    |
| 04:12      | and various bits and pieces.                                                                           |
| 04:14      | So I sort of always had an inkling or an interest in doing bits of automation and the sort of          |
| 04:20      | automation for remote services as well.                                                                |
| 04:23      | In fact, it's strange.                                                                                 |
| 04:24      | I mean, going right back to, I used to be tickled by, you know, back in the, before                    |
| 04:28      | I was into the Mac using MS-DOS and using config.sys and autoexec.bat to do things and                 |
| 04:34      | that used to fascinate me.                                                                             |
| 04:36      | You could control your computer by just typing in these little commands into these little              |
| 04:40      | files and things would happen.                                                                         |
| 04:42      | So, you know, it's right back to the early days, really.                                               |
| 04:44      | But I suppose in my work, because when I started work, I didn't really work with computers             |
| 04:50      | at the time.                                                                                           |
| 04:51      | I was a clerical sort of worker and then when IT came in, I moved across to the IT field               |
| 04:57      | and I've done various jobs in IT, but mainly on remote support and supporting users and                |
| 05:02      | then, of course, trying to create tools or use tools to help people out remotely.                      |
| 05:08      | In fact, going back to, this was probably the 1980s, I think, or the 90s, I was working                |
| 05:14      | for a government department.                                                                           |
| 05:16      | I worked for an outsourcing company who was managing sort of remote services for this                  |
| 05:22      | government department.                                                                                 |
| 05:23      | And although I didn't write it, one of the guys on my team actually wrote an application               |
| 05:30      | which was basically one of the very first versions of peer-to-peer networking and we                   |
| 05:35      | used to ship out software updates using sort of peer-to-peer transfers, which, you know,               |
| 05:40      | is well before torrents and things and this is going back a long time ago.                             |
| 05:45      | And I used to find that fascinating, you know, that we could ship out software updates and             |
| 05:48      | update people's machines and systems using all sorts of various bits and pieces.                       |
| 05:53      | But I specifically remember this one was really clever in that it used a peer-to-peer network          |
| 05:58      | so that we wouldn't send it out to everybody.                                                          |
| 06:01      | We would send it out to the first layer and it would automatically sort of promulgate down             |
| 06:05      | to the layers below that.                                                                              |
| 06:06      | It was very clever.                                                                                    |
| 06:07      | As I say, I didn't write that, but it was my team that was responsible for managing                    |
| 06:11      | that.                                                                                                  |
| 06:12      | That's genius.                                                                                         |
| 06:13      | I remember the computer my parents had in the 80s.                                                     |
| 06:16      | They still had it in the 90s when I was a young child.                                                 |
| 06:19      | You had to put in multiple floppy disks to start a program and then open your documents.               |
| 06:23      | So peer-to-peer networking was absolutely genius.                                                      |
| 06:26      | Yeah, yeah, yeah.                                                                                      |
| 06:28      | It was very clever.                                                                                    |
| 06:29      | Yeah, on the original Mac, you used to have your application disks like you'd have, you                |
| 06:34      | know, Mac right, and then you'd have your files disks.                                                 |
| 06:37      | So you'd be swapping them in and out while you're working.                                             |
| 06:40      | Like suddenly, if you used a font or something, it would go back in, you'd have to swap the            |
| 06:45      | disk back out before you went back to save your file.                                                  |
| 06:47      | Yeah, see, that was before my day that because I was very, I was quite late to the Mac really          |
| 06:52      | because I only started using the Mac in like 2005, I think it was.                                     |
| 06:56      | So I was, when the first Mac mini came out, that was when I first started using Mac.                   |
| 07:01      | So before then, I was always a PC guy, sort of Windows and Windows NT and some [[Unix]] as                 |
| 07:06      | well, because I did work on [[Unix]] platforms in my corporate job.                                        |
| 07:10      | That Mac mini brought in a lot of Mac curious people, right, you know?                                 |
| 07:14      | It really did, yeah, it really did.                                                                    |
| 07:16      | It was a great machine.                                                                                |
| 07:17      | It still is a great machine, obviously, but that very first one, you know, it brought                  |
| 07:21      | so many people into the Mac platform.                                                                  |
| 07:23      | It's incredible, really.                                                                               |
| 07:25      | You were talking about old automation, it reminded me, I think it was the late 80s or                  |
| 07:29      | early 90s, I was working for a firm that did, had, you know, Windows, of course, they didn't           |
| 07:35      | have Macs, but I wrote all of my templates out in word basic.                                          |
| 07:40      | Do you remember that language?                                                                         |
| 07:41      | Oh yeah.                                                                                               |
| 07:42      | Microsoft Word had its own basic interpreter and I would write templates and things into               |
| 07:47      | it and create menu items.                                                                              |
| 07:49      | I thought I thought I was very clever.                                                                 |
| 07:51      | Oh yeah, yeah.                                                                                         |
| 07:52      | Well, I mean, don't forget in those days, it was so new to us then, you know, that was                 |
| 07:56      | to be able to control these things was a real buzz, it still is a buzz now, but in those               |
| 08:01      | days, you know, it was something else that we never really experienced before.                         |
| 08:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 08:06      | So, you know, what are some of the things that you've seen change in automation over                   |
| 08:12      | the years, since you've been doing it this long?                                                       |
| 08:15      | I suppose, I mean, the number of sort of web-based platforms, I suppose, in the early days, everything |
| 08:23      | was done on the machine, all the automation was done on machine using scripts and whatever.            |
| 08:27      | But I've noticed, especially the past four or five years, there's been a lot more web-based            |
| 08:32      | services that allow you to remotely integrate with other services or with files or folders             |
| 08:39      | on your machine or, you know, just lots of glue there now that never was there before.                 |
| 08:44      | So, you know, you're not really limited just to your machine or your local environment.                |
| 08:48      | With some of these web-based services, you can do a ton more.                                          |
| 08:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 08:53      | We covered that on the show, but we're working on getting more coverage of that because it             |
| 08:57      | is such an interesting thing by choosing certain platforms and you've done that.                       |
| 09:01      | We're going to talk about that later in this show.                                                     |
| 09:03      | You open yourself up to web-based automation, which in some ways can be better than the                |
| 09:08      | automation you do on your local machine.                                                               |
| 09:11      | Well, it is really because most of these services, in fact, all of these services, they're all         |
| 09:15      | seven operations, they all use fancy things like web hooks or polling, not just your                   |
| 09:23      | local machine, but, you know, we'll talk later, I use [[Airtable]] a lot.                                   |
| 09:26      | We have a lot of data in [[Airtable]] and I use Zapier to go ahead and extract information                  |
| 09:31      | from [[Airtable]] and put it somewhere else and that's all sort of polling on a regular basis.              |
| 09:35      | So, you know, it's unattended automation.                                                              |
| 09:38      | You don't have to run any scripts or anything.                                                         |
| 09:39      | You can just sort of leave it running in the background and when something happens, the                |
| 09:42      | automation will kick off and do what you want it to do.                                                |
| 09:46      | So yeah, the web services, I think, are definitely a real boon these days.                             |
| 09:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 09:52      | Well, the alternative to a web service, of course, is, I mean, you could say get a $5                  |
| 09:55      | a month server on Linode and write your own scripts and have it do everything, but then                |
| 09:59      | you have to get a server, maintain a server, write all the scripts, maintain all the scripts           |
| 10:04      | and you have to make sure everything works all the time, whereas if you outsource to                   |
| 10:07      | something like Zapier, well, they've done most of the hard work for you and maybe these                |
| 10:11      | services aren't the cheapest, but in your case, you're running a business.                             |
| 10:14      | So A, it's a business expense and B, it must save you so much energy from fixing all those             |
| 10:20      | things that didn't run quite right because it wasn't automated.                                        |
| 10:23      | Yes, that's right.                                                                                     |
| 10:24      | And also, if a platform takes off, it becomes successful, then software developers then                |
| 10:29      | start to, you don't have to do the integration.                                                        |
| 10:32      | They will do the integration for you and just use the APIs and things that they develop.               |
| 10:35      | So, you know, the bigger the platform gets, the more popular, the more common applications             |
| 10:40      | you start to see on those platforms.                                                                   |
| 10:43      | And that's the case with Zapier, you know, there's hundreds, if not thousands of applications          |
| 10:46      | and services that you can automate using that as a glue between them.                                  |
| 10:50      | Yeah, and you don't have to, you know, you can't kid yourself about these things.                      |
| 10:53      | These are web services, like I do a lot of work in [[Airtable]] and recently I was working                 |
| 10:58      | on a large database in [[Airtable]] and it was just so slow as a movie in between fields                   |
| 11:03      | and I realised I was using the Mac app, the [[Airtable]] app, so I went over to the web version            |
| 11:10      | and it was super snappy, you know, it's like, oh yeah, what am I doing?                                |
| 11:13      | This is a web app, I have to treat it like a web app, just use it in the web.                          |
| 11:17      | Yeah, that's definitely, and also in a lot of the, you know, when I'm writing procedures               |
| 11:22      | for people to follow things in web apps, to follow things in [[Airtable]], you know, I'll                  |
| 11:27      | actually put the URL of the [[Airtable]] table so that they can just click on a link and                   |
| 11:31      | go straight to that table.                                                                             |
| 11:33      | It's very rarely that I actually use the Mac app for [[Airtable]] now, I use it solely as                  |
| 11:38      | a web-based platform.                                                                                  |
| 11:39      | Yeah, me too, I've switched, so I have previously been using the iOS and the Mac apps for capture      |
| 11:46      | of certain things into [[Airtable]] bases, but I've switched to doing all of that with [[Drafts]]             |
| 11:51      | and some custom draft sections that save things into [[Airtable]] or shortcuts because it's faster         |
| 11:57      | because it's using their API, I get a native experience and of course, you know, I then                |
| 12:02      | don't have to have [[Airtable]] open and most of these web applications, which are also                    |
| 12:07      | a Mac app, that's a Mac app in air quotes because it's not written for your Mac, it                    |
| 12:13      | is just a web wrapper, so it won't work offline, for example, and that is the downside to things       |
| 12:18      | like this, you know, it won't work offline, so if you're on a plane somewhere, then well,              |
| 12:22      | you can't check in on [[Airtable]], but you could write everything into [[Drafts]] and have a draft            |
| 12:26      | section save that to [[Airtable]] afterwards, so that's what I do.                                         |
| 12:30      | Yeah, that is a point, you know, with all these web services, you are dependent on an                  |
| 12:35      | internet connection, but, you know, how often do you not have an internet connection?                  |
| 12:40      | Well even on planes nowadays.                                                                          |
| 12:42      | Well, that was going to say, yeah, pretty much when you're traveling, but as you say                   |
| 12:45      | on planes now, you can actually get that, so it becomes a non-issue.                                   |
| 12:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 12:50      | Yeah, I actually look forward to losing that connection on an airplane.                                |
| 12:53      | Same here.                                                                                             |
| 12:54      | Same here.                                                                                             |
| 12:55      | I find it's all very well and good until I want to reference some documentation, I haven't             |
| 13:01      | saved it offline, at which point I'm there faced with the option of spending 20 euros                  |
| 13:04      | for two hours of internet or waiting and figuring out something else to do.                            |
| 13:09      | Yeah, I could read a book.                                                                             |
| 13:11      | Well, sometimes these things just stick in your head and you really want to read the                   |
| 13:14      | drafts' documentation on [[Dropbox]] Integration again.                                                    |
| 13:18      | I have my hobbies, everyone has their own.                                                             |
| 13:21      | There you go.                                                                                          |
| 13:22      | There you go.                                                                                          |
| 13:23      | There you go.                                                                                          |
| 13:24      | So, Don, it sounds like your platforms are for automation at this point are the web,                   |
| 13:27      | but I also know, of course, you do screencasts online, you do a lot of stuff with the Mac              |
| 13:30      | too.                                                                                                   |
| 13:31      | Are you doing much automation on the Mac side of things?                                               |
| 13:34      | Yeah, well, the most of the automation that we do is in the post-production process.                   |
| 13:39      | So basically, once we've exported the video and it's ready to publish, then there's a                  |
| 13:47      | whole step, a whole suite of scripts that we run to take the video to extract the chapters             |
| 13:54      | from it so we can have a chapter list to pop into the web page.                                        |
| 13:59      | We do things like we can also send subtitles.                                                          |
| 14:04      | So the audio track, we extract the audio track programmatically and send that across to Rev.           |
| 14:09      | So we use Rev to create the transcripts of the show and that's all done via a script.                  |
| 14:14      | So basically the script runs, in fact, it's a single script now.                                       |
| 14:17      | So the single script will sort of take the video file, strip out the chapters for the                  |
| 14:22      | chapter list.                                                                                          |
| 14:23      | It will then format the chapter list with asterisks using text.                                        |
| 14:26      | So it will then take the audio and send that across to Rev via [[Dropbox]] and they pick it                |
| 14:31      | up automatically in [[Dropbox]] and they will then send back the subtitles in a day or two                 |
| 14:36      | once that's been done.                                                                                 |
| 14:37      | And then we go in, we create the preview file.                                                         |
| 14:40      | So as well as the main file, there's a preview file now, which is normally the first between           |
| 14:44      | three and five minutes of the show and then sort of a canned trailer at the end.                       |
| 14:50      | And that's put together automatically.                                                                 |
| 14:52      | We don't do that.                                                                                      |
| 14:53      | That's done by the script.                                                                             |
| 14:54      | The script will actually create that preview file for us.                                              |
| 14:56      | And then we get the script will then go ahead and encode the preview file and the master               |
| 15:03      | file into four different resolutions.                                                                  |
| 15:05      | So we've got a 1080p and a 720p version of each.                                                       |
| 15:09      | And then it will also go in and in fact, that script then finishes then at that point we               |
| 15:14      | go in and just check everything's run through okay.                                                    |
| 15:16      | And then we pass it on to another script, which what does that one do that one then                    |
| 15:21      | goes ahead and generates the graphics tiles that we use in social media and on the web                 |
| 15:27      | page as well, you know, we create graphic files with a title and an icon and the duration.             |
| 15:34      | That's all done by machine.                                                                            |
| 15:35      | We don't do any of that.                                                                               |
| 15:36      | That's all done automatically.                                                                         |
| 15:38      | There's also a script that goes ahead and extracts information from our table and sends                |
| 15:43      | that table information across over to the screencast and line server injects a [[SQL]] command             |
| 15:50      | in there creates the show page and that generates the dynamic web show page for the particular         |
| 15:55      | show that we're working on.                                                                            |
| 15:56      | So there's lots and lots of little tiny things that are sort of put together in scripts that           |
| 16:01      | help us just produce a show in a consistent fashion and of course try and save it as some              |
| 16:07      | time as well.                                                                                          |
| 16:08      | Well, I want to unpack that done.                                                                      |
| 16:10      | That's a lot of information.                                                                           |
| 16:12      | So let's do that right after this.                                                                     |
| 16:15      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by Bottomless, a product that automates your              |
| 16:19      | supply of coffee.                                                                                      |
| 16:20      | But Bottomless isn't just some coffee subscription sending you coffee whether or not you need          |
| 16:25      | it.                                                                                                    |
| 16:26      | Nobody needs a new bag exactly every week, right?                                                      |
| 16:29      | Instead, Bottomless shifts based on how much coffee you actually use.                                  |
| 16:33      | Sounds like magic, right?                                                                              |
| 16:35      | But so how does it work?                                                                               |
| 16:38      | First, Bottomless sends you a Wi-Fi connected scale with your first coffee order.                      |
| 16:42      | Once you store the coffee on the scale, Bottomless will be able to track the data, always knowing      |
| 16:46      | how much coffee you have and how fast you're going through it.                                         |
| 16:49      | This way, Bottomless will ship you fresh bags to arrive just when you're getting low.                  |
| 16:54      | In other words, Bottomless is a new system of household automation.                                    |
| 16:58      | No more going to the store over and over or micromanaging subscriptions.                               |
| 17:02      | And it's effortless.                                                                                   |
| 17:03      | The scale lasts six months on a single charge.                                                         |
| 17:06      | Just set it up with Wi-Fi once and then cross coffee off your to-do list for the next year.            |
| 17:11      | Now, let's talk about the coffee.                                                                      |
| 17:13      | You'll have plenty of types to choose from, like espresso, dark roast, fancy single origins,           |
| 17:18      | or a simple houseplants.                                                                               |
| 17:20      | The best part is that orders are shipped straight from the roasters to you, meaning whichever          |
| 17:24      | type you like, it'll always be super fresh.                                                            |
| 17:27      | Bottomless is also more efficient at other ways of distributing coffee, so they pass                   |

| 17:53      | Our thanks to Bottomless for their support of this show and all of Relay FM.                          |
| 18:00      | So Don, one of the things you were saying before we took a break is this interaction                   |
| 18:05      | between your [[Airtable]] database and your [[SQL]] database or [[SQL]], depending on what religion                |
| 18:10      | you are.                                                                                               |
| 18:12      | And with the Screencast Online website, can you explain how that works and how it got                  |
| 18:17      | built?                                                                                                 |
| 18:18      | Yeah, sure.                                                                                            |
| 18:19      | I mean, if I was going to start again, I'd probably do everything within the [[SQL]] database              |
| 18:23      | within Screencast Online, but with a lot of these things, they sort of grow organically,               |
| 18:29      | so you might sort of be working on one particular aspect and then something else happens and           |
| 18:33      | you start working somewhere else, and then you need to join them together.                             |
| 18:37      | And that's what happened in this instance.                                                             |
| 18:39      | So basically, we have this [[SQL]] database, which is a show database.                                     |
| 18:44      | It's got all the information for all the different shows.                                              |
| 18:46      | So it's got the show number, all the durations, the chapter list, the URLs of where the show           |
| 18:51      | lives, the videos, where all the different versions of the videos lives.                               |
| 18:55      | It's got the show description, it's got the show summary, it's got tags.                               |
| 19:00      | So basically, all that information relating to a single show is held within a [[SQL]] database             |
| 19:05      | in a table called Shows.                                                                               |
| 19:07      | And Jamie, who is our web developer, has created a system whereby it will use that data in             |
| 19:12      | a [[SQL]] database to generate the Screencast Online show page.                                            |
| 19:16      | And that includes the video, includes the player, includes all the information I've just told          |
| 19:21      | you about in a nice format.                                                                            |
| 19:23      | So we don't have to create the show page manually, that's done just extracting the data from           |
| 19:26      | the database.                                                                                          |
| 19:28      | And to get the data in, when Jamie originally developed the system, he would create a form             |
| 19:34      | for us basically.                                                                                      |
| 19:36      | So we would go in and we'd copy and paste between different sources of information, the information    |
| 19:40      | required for the show, and we'd just copy that into a form on the website, hit Submit,                 |
| 19:45      | and that record would be created, and then the show page would appear when the publication             |
| 19:49      | date came around.                                                                                      |
| 19:51      | And then I started to use [[Airtable]] for different things.                                                |
| 19:55      | Really like [[Airtable]].                                                                                   |
| 19:56      | It's a great tool, very, very easy to use.                                                             |
| 19:59      | So rather than sort of learn how to use [[SQL]] properly, [[Airtable]] is really quick to use and               |
| 20:04      | you can just knock something together very, very quickly.                                              |
| 20:07      | And I ended up pretty much replicating the show's database in [[Airtable]], just because it                 |
| 20:12      | was easier for me to use.                                                                              |
| 20:14      | And then I thought, well, hang on, I've got this information in two places now.                        |
| 20:18      | So why don't I start the information off in [[Airtable]] and then transfer it across to the                 |
| 20:22      | [[SQL]] database?                                                                                          |
| 20:23      | And basically over time, that's what's happened.                                                       |
| 20:25      | So we sort of replicate the same fields, et cetera, that are in the [[SQL]] database.                      |
| 20:30      | And then various people add the information into [[Airtable]] as we're building up the show.                |
| 20:36      | And then once we're happy and once everything's in there, it's basically just a matter of              |
| 20:40      | clicking on a checkbox in [[Airtable]].                                                                     |
| 20:43      | Once a record has that checkbox clicked, it goes into a special view.                                  |
| 20:49      | And then we use Zapier to have a look at this view.                                                    |
| 20:52      | So it pulls this view every five minutes.                                                              |
| 20:54      | And if a new record appears in the [[Airtable]] view, and it appears because the checkbox                   |
| 20:58      | is ticked, there is a built-in, or there's some integration in Zapier that allows you                  |
| 21:03      | to extract from [[Airtable]] and inject into [[SQL]].                                                           |
| 21:07      | So it basically does that.                                                                             |
| 21:08      | So Zapier checks every five minutes.                                                                   |
| 21:10      | If it sees a new show in [[Airtable]] in this view, it will take that information and it will               |
| 21:14      | squirt it into [[SQL]].                                                                                    |
| 21:16      | And then at that point, a new show page has been created, and all we need to do then is                |
| 21:20      | just go across and just double check that everything's OK.                                             |
| 21:23      | And then when the publication date comes around, it gets published automatically.                      |
| 21:27      | Now, one of the challenges with [[Airtable]] and Zapier is the number of times you can pull                 |
| 21:34      | or pull an [[Airtable]] record through Zapier to stick into your web-based automation.                      |
| 21:41      | And we've heard from listeners who hear our show and they're like, hey, I want to do this.             |
| 21:44      | But they oftentimes run into the problem that you're solving with that checkbox.                       |
| 21:49      | Could you explain that just a little bit more?                                                         |
| 21:51      | Yeah, as I remember, because it's a while since I've done it.                                          |
| 21:54      | But I think I have a view set up, which is basically populate this view if this checkbox               |
| 22:01      | is checked.                                                                                            |
| 22:03      | It creates, but only when it's checked the first time.                                                 |
| 22:06      | So in effect, this view is always empty until you check the checkbox.                                  |
| 22:12      | And then once you've checked the checkbox, the record that you've checked appears in                   |
| 22:14      | that view.                                                                                             |
| 22:15      | But I think it's limited just for 24 hours, because I think, yeah, that's right.                       |
| 22:21      | I think the view is, if this checkbox is checked and the record, and it hasn't been checked            |
| 22:26      | or it's only been checked within the last 24 hours, it will appear in the view.                        |
| 22:30      | So Zapier then checks that view for any new entries in the view.                                       |
| 22:34      | And as soon as it sees a new entry, it will fire.                                                      |
| 22:37      | But because that is no longer a new entry, once it's fired the first time, it doesn't                  |
| 22:41      | fire again afterwards.                                                                                 |
| 22:42      | Yeah, that's where the limitations of Zapier and [[Airtable]] when it's watching an [[Airtable]]                 |
| 22:47      | base.                                                                                                  |
| 22:48      | So if this is limited to the entire base, it will only trigger on the appearance of                    |
| 22:53      | a record once.                                                                                         |
| 22:55      | And from memory, that's global.                                                                        |
| 22:57      | So it's not just within a view.                                                                        |
| 22:59      | If it's seen that record once and executed an automation on it, it won't do it again.                  |
| 23:04      | And I'm guessing this is due to the way that they've set up their architecture.                        |
| 23:06      | And if somebody who from Zapier is listening and knows that this is wrong, please do update            |
| 23:11      | me, because I know I've had this before where I wanted something to go from one view to                |
| 23:14      | another view, at which point I would then get on and do my job.                                        |
| 23:18      | And then I was going to take it and send it to another view, and my second view wasn't                 |
| 23:21      | triggering.                                                                                            |
| 23:22      | And I was trying to figure that out, and I talked to the Zapier staff, and definitely                  |
| 23:25      | the point and time where I talked to them, it was a limitation of, well, you've already                |
| 23:30      | had an automation run on the [[Airtable]] record.                                                           |
| 23:33      | The fact that the record has changed in between is beside the point, but there are other ways          |
| 23:38      | to get around it.                                                                                      |
| 23:39      | So for example, I often trigger Zapier by saying, hey, here is a record ID.                            |
| 23:44      | At which point it can go look up that record and then do something with it, which is perhaps           |
| 23:49      | a good way or a bad way around it.                                                                     |
| 23:51      | It depends on how you work.                                                                            |
| 23:53      | How do you pass the record ID to it?                                                                   |
| 23:55      | I mean, is it?                                                                                         |
| 23:56      | Well, Zapier has webhooks.                                                                             |
| 23:58      | And so what you can do is you can set your trigger to be a webhook, and then you can get               |
| 24:03      | contents of URL in shortcuts and just send it to it.                                                   |
| 24:07      | And that's usually what I do.                                                                          |
| 24:08      | And I just say, hey, this app should be triggered with this record ID, please.                         |
| 24:14      | You can create a formula in [[Airtable]] to show your record ID in a column.                                |
| 24:19      | So I just copy that and send it off.                                                                   |
| 24:22      | So you're pushing a button to manually send it over?                                                   |
| 24:24      | Yeah, yeah, which is not ideal, but at the same time, if I have to manually do work in                 |
| 24:29      | that step anyway, then it's one more little thing that I need to do.                                   |
| 24:33      | And I try and get these things automated as far as possible, as our listeners are well                 |
| 24:38      | aware.                                                                                                 |
| 24:39      | And the benefit of that is it's a forced process, so it only works when you tell it, but then          |
| 24:47      | it does everything else for you.                                                                       |
| 24:49      | It can go to multiple web services and do all the extraction and pasting and everything                |
| 24:54      | you want.                                                                                              |
| 24:55      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                         |
| 24:56      | Yeah, the good thing with my set up is that obviously it's not a high volume trigger because           |
| 25:00      | we're only creating two shows a week, or we might have four or five shows if we're producing           |
| 25:05      | them in advance.                                                                                       |
| 25:06      | It's something that's running constantly, but the trigger is very infrequent.                          |
| 25:12      | In fact, sometimes, to be honest, if I'm actually running through the process, rather than wait        |
| 25:16      | the five minutes, I'll log on to Zapier and just run the Zap manually because it's just                |
| 25:20      | that bit quicker if you want to get on with it.                                                        |
| 25:23      | But normally, don't have too many problems.                                                            |
| 25:26      | Sometimes if there's a field missing or malformed and it doesn't like it, it will stop.                |
| 25:30      | In which case, my quick workaround is just a nip into that view and duplicate the record,              |
| 25:35      | duplicate the box so it sees a new record and it will just run again and then delete                   |
| 25:38      | that record.                                                                                           |
| 25:39      | But that's just a little workaround that I do sometimes.                                               |
| 25:42      | Yeah, we're so close on this stuff, but sometimes it does take just a little bit of nudging.           |
| 25:49      | Oh, yes.                                                                                               |
| 25:50      | So, in general, you're happy with [[Airtable]] though, sounds like.                                        |
| 25:53      | Yeah, I love [[Airtable]].                                                                                 |
| 25:55      | We use it for lots of...                                                                               |
| 25:57      | The nice thing is with [[Airtable]], and the reason why I use it is that it's quite easy                   |
| 26:03      | to let other people get access to it.                                                                  |
| 26:06      | So I've not got people directly integrating or interfacing with the main screencast online             |
| 26:12      | database because that's sacrosanct because that's the live database that the website                   |
| 26:18      | uses to generate the shows and that's where all my customers go to get the content.                    |
| 26:24      | Whereas with the [[Airtable]] database, we can go in there, we can screw things up, we can                 |
| 26:28      | put things in incorrectly, and it's not customer facing, so we can get that right in [[Airtable]]          |
| 26:32      | and then once we're happy, we can then automate and ship across to the live database.                  |
| 26:37      | So it's just like a stageing post, really, and it's so easy to use, it's really good.                   |
| 26:42      | I'm just right on the hairy edge of becoming a subscriber because they're very generous                |
| 26:46      | with their free plan, and I've got several Airtables I'm sharing with multiple people,                 |
| 26:52      | Rose included on one of them or two of them, but I want conditional formatting, and there's            |
| 26:58      | some other things I want, and I'm starting to look now at the paid plan.                               |
| 27:02      | I think I'm probably headed that direction.                                                            |
| 27:05      | I hit the limit of records in the free bases quite some time ago, so I've been paying just             |
| 27:13      | for one above the base plan, which gives you a lot more records, and that's keeping me                 |
| 27:18      | going for now, but I can see more [[Airtable]] in my future, so I'll probably end up going                 |
| 27:23      | up another level.                                                                                      |
| 27:24      | Well, one of the benefits of doing Screencast Online is that I did several shows on [[Airtable]]           |
| 27:29      | a while ago and included a referral link, so I think I'm still using the proceeds of                   |
| 27:35      | those referral links to pay for my [[Airtable]] access, but once that runs out, I'll definitely            |
| 27:42      | be paying for it anyway.                                                                               |
| 27:44      | It is a great service, and it's an excellent stageing place for automation, if you want                 |
| 27:49      | to do web-based automation because it works with everything.                                           |
| 27:52      | Absolutely.                                                                                            |
| 27:53      | All right, so when you're creating this connection between [[SQL]] and [[Airtable]], so you're using           |
| 27:59      | [[Airtable]] and Zapier, those are your key platforms.                                                     |
| 28:04      | How did you come on Zapier?                                                                            |
| 28:08      | I'm not sure how I came across it because I use it for lots of different things now.                   |
| 28:13      | Another big piece of automation that I use Zapier for is regular social media updates,                 |
| 28:21      | so when a show gets published, I use Buffer, so I integrate between [[Airtable]], Zapier and               |
| 28:28      | Buffer, so basically, again, we put some information into [[Airtable]] that gets extracted                 |
| 28:36      | by Zapier and placed into Buffer, and Buffer is a service which will automatically post                |
| 28:42      | social media updates for you, so when a show is published or when a magazine is published,             |
| 28:47      | it's like the tagline of the show, and the tile I mentioned before, we generate some                   |
| 28:54      | tiles automatically, but basically, we can then publish that in Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,           |
| 29:03      | so it will publish two entries on each service, the day of publication, and then two or three          |
| 29:09      | days later, it will republish them again, again, all based on extracting information                   |
| 29:14      | from [[Airtable]] using Zapier, and then using Zapier to push that information to Buffer,                  |
| 29:19      | and then Buffer automates the process of publishing to the very social media platforms.                |
| 29:24      | That was the original, I think that was the first thing that I came across Zapier for,                 |
| 29:29      | that's what I wanted to do, and I sort of used it to that and then saw that we could                   |
| 29:32      | do more things with it.                                                                                |
| 29:36      | How does the trigger work for that automation, when does Zapier know, okay, now they've published      |
| 29:41      | this show, so it's okay to social media share it?                                                      |
| 29:45      | Right, again, I think it's mainly all used by views, so I have special views that because              |
| 29:51      | each show has a publication date, when a show is published, it will appear in that view,               |
| 29:58      | so then Zapier can see that a new record has appeared in that view, and it's on the day                |
| 30:03      | that it's been published, so that will trigger off the automation and extract the relevant             |
| 30:07      | pieces of data and send that off to Buffer, and then once Buffer received it, within Buffer            |
| 30:12      | you can say when this record is set up and publish at a certain time of the day, so we                 |
| 30:19      | normally publish things sort of midnight Chicago time, so in Buffer it says 10 o'clock                 |
| 30:25      | UK time, publish the first tweet, and that gives us time to make sure that everything's                |
| 30:28      | worked okay, so we just specify a time within Buffer, and then again within Buffer you can             |
| 30:34      | say three days after the first tweet or something, so that goes off three days after that.             |
| 30:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 30:40      | Are you using the paid Buffer plan for this, or are you on one of their free plans?                    |
| 30:45      | We're using it for automators as well.                                                                 |
| 30:47      | Yeah, I think we're on the paid plan, but it's not that expensive actually, it's very                  |
| 30:52      | reasonable as far as I can remember, we're on the paid plan anyway.                                    |
| 30:55      | Yeah, I find it very useful for automators because one of our Zapier's apps creates the                |
| 31:00      | post in the forums for us, and then of course it tweets that out a couple of days later,               |
| 31:04      | and it's really useful just being able to push that into Buffer and have it just automated             |
| 31:08      | and go out so that people can get the link.                                                            |
| 31:11      | And I get again, I mentioned that we do a tagline for each show, so at the beginning                   |
| 31:17      | of the tweet or the Facebook or LinkedIn post, there's normally like a short sentence describing       |
| 31:22      | what the show is, so I have another automation using Podio this time, which the nice thing             |
| 31:28      | with Podio is that you can have email sent out on certain days of the week, so I'll                    |
| 31:33      | get an email pushed out on a Monday that says, don't forget to make sure that the next couple          |
| 31:38      | of shows have the social media tag assigned to them.                                                   |
| 31:41      | And then a link in there that allows me to click on the link, it opens a table in the                  |
| 31:45      | correct view that shows all the shows and all the completed taglines, and I just go                    |
| 31:49      | through and make sure that there's a, if the standard tagline isn't appropriate or could               |
| 31:55      | be better, I can edit it within a table, and then when the automation kicks off, that tagline          |
| 32:00      | is then used in the social media post.                                                                 |

| 32:34      | If you ever use Wi-Fi at a hotel or a shopping mall, you're sending data over an open network          |
| 32:39      | with no encryption.                                                                                    |

| 33:01      | It's so easy.                                                                                          |

| 34:31      | Our thanks to ExpressVPN for their support of the Automators and Olive Relay FM.                       |
| 34:38      | Don, before we take the break, you started talking about Podio, and that is another thing              |
| 34:43      | I know you use a lot to run your business and automate things.                                         |
| 34:47      | Could you explain that a little bit?                                                                   |
| 34:48      | Yeah, Podio.                                                                                           |
| 34:49      | I don't know if it's called Podio or Podio.                                                            |
| 34:51      | I'm not too sure, but I call it Podio.                                                                 |
| 34:53      | It's by Citrix, and it's basically a process.                                                          |
| 34:58      | It manages business processes, which sounds a bit fluffy, but it allows you to do so many              |
| 35:03      | different things.                                                                                      |
| 35:05      | It's really difficult to describe, but I'll try my best.                                               |
| 35:08      | Basically, we run the show schedule in Podio.                                                          |
| 35:12      | We have a master table that contains all the shows and all the publication dates.                      |
| 35:19      | Because we have a specific process that takes the show through the various stages of setting           |
| 35:26      | the show up, creating the folder structures within the Mac to receive all the files, to                |
| 35:34      | getting in touch with Apple, because we have an SEO showcase app, which allows us to sell              |
| 35:41      | individual episodes of the shows.                                                                      |
| 35:42      | It needs a code from Apple, basically, to sell it within the app.                                      |
| 35:50      | That's one process.                                                                                    |
| 35:52      | We then set up a record for the guest presenters to know what the file name is going to be,            |
| 36:00      | repository for them to put all the summary information, repository for them to put the                 |
| 36:04      | links when they finished recording the file.                                                           |
| 36:07      | There's apps within Podio that deal with each stage of the process.                                    |
| 36:12      | If I just go to the recording app within Podio, basically, what happens is we'll send an               |
| 36:19      | email off to the presenter with a link to the Podio record for them to set up the show.                |
| 36:26      | They will open up Podio, they will see what the show references are, so a little code                  |
| 36:32      | to put in the file name, links, places where they can upload the file.                                 |
| 36:37      | Once they've finished their recording, there's a thing called statuses in there as well.               |
| 36:41      | They would receive the record, they can change the status to acknowledged, and then I get              |
| 36:46      | a notification to know that they've opened the record and they've seen it.                             |
| 36:49      | When they start recording, they get to put in an in-progress status, and again, we can                 |
| 36:54      | see within Podio.                                                                                      |
| 36:55      | I can see a list of all the shows and just look at the status of each show and see what                |
| 36:59      | stage they're at.                                                                                      |
| 37:01      | They record their show.                                                                                |
| 37:03      | Basically they would then edit the show and upload it to [[Dropbox]], at which point they would            |
| 37:09      | put the [[Dropbox]] link in the Podio record and change the status to ready for review.                    |
| 37:14      | JF would then get an email saying that status has changed, there is a new show in there                |
| 37:19      | for review.                                                                                            |
| 37:20      | He can go into Podio into the same record.                                                             |
| 37:22      | It downloads it from [[Dropbox]], reviews the file.                                                        |
| 37:27      | If there's nothing wrong, or if there's no extra annotations or extra narrations need                  |
| 37:34      | to be done, it's ready to go.                                                                          |
| 37:35      | He can just move on to the next stage, or he can send it back to the presenter at that                 |
| 37:39      | point and change the status to say, change is required.                                                |
| 37:43      | They make the changes, re-upload it, change the status for another review, and then JF                 |
| 37:48      | okays it and then it gets passed along to the next process, but as it gets along to the                |
| 37:53      | next process, that then creates a new job for the next process.                                        |
| 37:57      | That might be for a different suite of people, different statuses, different information held          |
| 38:01      | within the Podio record.                                                                               |
| 38:04      | You can use Podio and a thing called GlobiFlow.                                                        |
| 38:07      | There is an automation built into Podio, but there's a separate package called GlobiFlow,              |
| 38:12      | which is again part of the Podio suite, but it just gives you a much richer level of automation        |
| 38:19      | and you can go in and do all sorts of weird and wonderful things.                                      |
| 38:23      | To be honest, I only scratch the surface of what you can do, but it's very, very comprehensive         |
| 38:27      | than the amounts of automation you can do.                                                             |
| 38:29      | I rely mainly on looking for status changes, sending emails off on those status changes.               |
| 38:35      | If fields change, if something gets uploaded, that can trigger an automation to either create          |
| 38:40      | a new job or do basically anything, it's very, very powerful.                                          |
| 38:46      | We also work on task lists.                                                                            |
| 38:48      | When a job is created, there's also a list of tasks with that job, and that's created                  |
| 38:53      | automatically.                                                                                         |
| 38:54      | When a job is created, again, going back to the example of the presenter, when the recording           |
| 38:59      | job is created, we create a task list as well, and that gets appended to the bottom of the             |
| 39:03      | record.                                                                                                |
| 39:04      | They could, if they wanted to, go through and just check off each task as they've done                 |
| 39:07      | it, and then when they've finished, click on completed, and Podio will then create a                   |
| 39:12      | new job for the next stage and pass on and notify the relevant people.                                 |
| 39:17      | It seems like a little bit like Basecamp, but maybe more project management oriented.                  |
| 39:23      | I'm not really sure.                                                                                   |
| 39:24      | Well, I've used both of them, and I can say Basecamp has got boards, and then you've got               |
| 39:29      | messages and chats and stuff in them, but Podio is more like a user-friendly database                  |
| 39:35      | in my experience.                                                                                      |
| 39:36      | Does that tell you what you think, Don?                                                                |
| 39:38      | It's sort of like a very structured way of guiding people through a process.                           |
| 39:45      | Yes, it is a database in that you do contain information within there, but it's what you               |
| 39:52      | can do with that information.                                                                          |
| 39:54      | It's sort of like a database with lots of triggers built in, so that when things change,               |
| 40:01      | things happen.                                                                                         |
| 40:02      | Yes, whenever I open a record, because of course I'm being assigned certain video records,             |
| 40:07      | and I have to get on and do my part of it, then you open it up, and it's very clear what               |
| 40:12      | I need to do, because this field is empty, fill it in, and then the next field is, well,               |
| 40:17      | you need a video link.                                                                                 |
| 40:18      | It's like, okay, well, now I need to go and do the big work.                                           |
| 40:21      | That's the part you can't automate, but...                                                             |
| 40:23      | Yes, that's unfortunate.                                                                               |
| 40:24      | But it's not nice things whereby, because there are members, it uses a concept of workspaces           |
| 40:30      | and apps within workspaces, so you assign various members to a workspace, and then when                |
| 40:37      | you're creating a template for a Podio record, you can go in and you can assign people, so             |
| 40:45      | you can assign tasks to people, and it will automate what notifications get sent to different          |
| 40:52      | people, depending on how you've set it up.                                                             |
| 40:55      | So there's that level as well.                                                                         |
| 40:56      | It's not just that there is a way of linking people with tasks and people with jobs, and               |
| 41:02      | it handles that really, really well.                                                                   |
| 41:04      | And of course, you can customise everything about it, so you've got all of these different             |
| 41:07      | form fields, but those are things that you said that you need and that you've created                  |
| 41:12      | instead of...                                                                                          |
| 41:14      | If everyone can make sure to put the longer video description in this field, which is                  |
| 41:18      | called Field72, that would be great.                                                                   |
| 41:21      | It's much more user-friendly than some other things I've run into in the business world.               |
| 41:26      | And then the automation component on it, what was it called again, Orbi, something?                    |
| 41:31      | It's called GlobiFlow.                                                                                 |
| 41:33      | GlobiFlow.                                                                                             |
| 41:34      | Yeah, I've grabbed a link and put it in the show notes already, everybody.                             |
| 41:37      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 41:38      | As I say, there is some automation built into Podio as it stands, but to do the really                 |
| 41:42      | clever stuff, sort of looking things up in some conditional aspects, GlobiFlow is the                  |
| 41:49      | way to go.                                                                                             |
| 41:50      | I wouldn't really use it without GlobiFlow, to be honest, you can do so much more with                 |
| 41:52      | it.                                                                                                    |
| 41:53      | How did you come across this product?                                                                  |
| 41:56      | Again, it was just looking for a solution for a problem I had.                                         |
| 42:00      | Sure.                                                                                                  |
| 42:01      | We've run it for quite a while now, so there's quite a steep learning curve, to be honest.             |
| 42:07      | But yeah, I think it was just when I first started wanting to involve more people in                   |
| 42:14      | the business and looking for ways to control how the process was managed and keep track,               |
| 42:20      | but also have the process to be a bit more intelligent than just sort of filling in a                  |
| 42:25      | spreadsheet or whatever.                                                                               |
| 42:26      | I just wanted something that was a bit more interactive and it seemed to fit the bill.                 |
| 42:30      | Now, you're even combining this product with some native Apple Labs for your newsletter                |
| 42:35      | or your magazine article production.                                                                   |
| 42:38      | For the magazine, yeah.                                                                                |
| 42:40      | Yeah, because I've been using Podio to manage the video workflow, when we started the magazine,        |
| 42:49      | and I wanted a package to manage the article creation.                                                 |
| 42:54      | Podio seemed to be the ideal system, so we've created a separate workspace called Newsletter           |
| 42:58      | Production, and in there we have a Podio app, which is called Articles.                                |
| 43:04      | One called Issues, so all the issues and all the dates for the issues are in one app.                  |
| 43:09      | Then in another app, we have all the articles.                                                         |
| 43:13      | Basically now, when people submit articles, they submit them into Podio.                               |
| 43:18      | You have large text fields, and you have the same things, lots of status options, so we                |
| 43:23      | use Markdown.                                                                                          |
| 43:25      | Basically the people go in, or Rose will be doing this as well because Rose is now contributing        |
| 43:31      | to the magazine, but basically she'll go in, search the article's database in effect to                |
| 43:36      | see whether or not a topic's been covered, if it hasn't, create a new record in there,                 |
| 43:40      | populate the record with her information, paste the full article into the body of the                  |
| 43:46      | Podio record, including all the Markdown formatting, and then when she's finished, taps the status     |
| 43:51      | to say ready for review, again, that goes across to JF, and he proofreads it when he's                 |
| 43:57      | proofread it, he says completed, and that's now ready for inclusion in the magazine.                   |
| 44:03      | What we do then is once we've got all the articles for that week's magazine, or that                   |
| 44:08      | month's magazine, and you can create separate views, so you can just filter out those articles         |
| 44:13      | that are for that particular magazine for a single issue.                                              |
| 44:16      | We can go ahead and do an Excel export, because it integrates with Excel or CSV.                       |
| 44:22      | We produce an export of that view, which contains all the articles for that particular magazine,       |
| 44:28      | and then I've started, because Pages still hasn't got proper merge tools, I use [[Sal Soghoian\|Sal Soghoian's]]    |
| 44:33      | data merge tool, which is a fantastic tool, basically it will take Excel or CSV or             |
| 44:39      | plain text, and you create a template within Pages, so we've created a master template for             |
| 44:46      | an article page, and then we run it through the Pages data merge tool, and that takes                  |
| 44:53      | the information from the Excel or CSV file, and drops it straight into the Pages file,                 |
| 44:58      | and it's pretty much a matter of just going in then, putting those pages together, and                 |
| 45:04      | formatting them as we want, Pages is a great page layout tool, we do that, and then once               |
| 45:09      | that's finished, we ship that off to another platform called MagCast, which is our publishing          |
| 45:15      | platform.                                                                                              |
| 45:16      | It takes us a PDF, we export it as a PDF, and the PDF then goes across to MagCast, and                 |
| 45:22      | we go in and link the various links within MagCast, and after the end of that process                  |
| 45:28      | it's ready to be published.                                                                            |
| 45:29      | But we also do that with the videos as well, because all the video data for each tutorial              |
| 45:33      | is held within Podio, so we can do it exactly the same, do an extract, a CSV extract of the            |
| 45:37      | video data for that one issue.                                                                         |
| 45:40      | Then we have a template file, which is just basically a page layout with all the field                 |
| 45:45      | names in, within Pages, do the Pages, merge data tool, bit, creator, it spits out a number             |
| 45:51      | of Pages documents which we then assemble, and then they get fitted into the magazine                  |
| 45:55      | as well.                                                                                               |
| 45:56      | So, the bulk of the magazine assembly is automated.                                                    |
| 46:01      | We do go in and do the page layout manually, Rob, Rob Workman looks after the magazine,                |
| 46:06      | so he actually runs all the stages of assembling the magazine and doing the formatting.                |
| 46:12      | But yeah, we use automation basically to create every single page within the magazine itself.          |
| 46:20      | How do you convert the markdown into rich text, because as far as I'm aware, Pages doesn't             |
| 46:24      | support markdown, does it?                                                                             |
| 46:27      | That is done manually, but we can, there is another tool, because Rob can see how it's                 |
| 46:34      | been done.                                                                                             |
| 46:35      | There is another tool we use, if we do a text version of the magazine as well, which is                |
| 46:41      | done within the MagCast platform, and they will import, they will allow us to import                   |
| 46:45      | Microsoft Word formatted documents.                                                                    |
| 46:48      | But there is a tool, and the name escapes me, we'll have to put it in the show notes                   |
| 46:51      | once I go back and find it, but there is a tool that will take the markdown format and                 |
| 46:53      | spit it out as a Microsoft Word document, which can then import into MagCast, and that                 |
| 46:58      | will do the conversion.                                                                                |
| 46:59      | But no, you're quite right, the data merge tool just sees it as markdown, so Rob has                   |
| 47:04      | to go in and just change it.                                                                           |
| 47:06      | We don't use extensive markdown, it's mainly the titles and italics and stuff like that,               |
| 47:10      | but that's easy enough to pick up.                                                                     |
| 47:11      | I'll bear that in mind when writing my articles.                                                       |
| 47:16      | When I used to do the iBooks author books, that platform was very picky and very likely                |
| 47:25      | to break if you imported formatted text to it.                                                         |
| 47:29      | It was supposed to, you're supposed to be able to write it in Pages and just block and                 |
| 47:33      | paste it in, and it would just work.                                                                   |
| 47:35      | And it never did.                                                                                      |
| 47:36      | In fact, sometimes you'd find at the end that there was some error that was not even visible           |
| 47:41      | that was breaking the whole book, so I learned very quickly to write in markdown and import            |
| 47:47      | the text as markdown, and then I'd have to go in and manually format it in the iBooks                  |
| 47:51      | author platform if I wanted it to work, so I've been there, and I have been there.                     |
| 47:59      | Something you said quickly, the sales are going in scripts, one of my very favourite                    |
| 48:03      | web pages on the entire internet is macosxautomation.com, and that's where, I don't know how this      |
| 48:10      | worked, because Sal wrote this when he was at Apple, now he's not there, but it's still                |
| 48:14      | on the internet, but it's got some great scripts.                                                      |
| 48:17      | If you want to use Pages or any of the Apple standard apps, there's some great automation              |
| 48:23      | there, and if you're listening to the show, this is a page that you should have bookmarked.            |
| 48:28      | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                      |
| 48:29      | I think Sal actually did it, although he was working for Apple at the time, he did it independently,   |
| 48:33      | he got some dispensation to do it completely independently, so presumably now he's no longer           |
| 48:37      | there, it's an independent web publication, but yeah, there's a ton of stuff in there                  |
| 48:44      | that's well worth having a look at.                                                                    |
| 48:45      | One of the first things I did when I heard he was leaving Apple's, I ran in and downloaded             |
| 48:49      | everything, and then of course, you know, he had exactly, although I probably could                    |
| 48:54      | have emailed him, but yeah, either way, it's up, and I think it's there for the duration,              |
| 48:59      | so if you're interested, go check that out, there is so much great automation on that                  |
| 49:04      | page.                                                                                                  |
| 49:05      | And I have a direct link to the data merge script that you were talking about in our                   |
| 49:09      | show notes as well, Don, so if anybody's looking for that specifically, there's a link directly        |
| 49:14      | to that one, that's on iworkautomation.com, but that is linked from macosxautomation.com,               |
| 49:18      | so macosxautomation.com, and then you sort of filter out all of the different areas.                    |
| 49:23      | It's very good fun.                                                                                    |
| 49:24      | You can easily spend hours getting lost playing with Apple Sculpt, and if you didn't spend             |
| 49:30      | hours playing with regular expressions, which a lot of people have already told us that                |
| 49:34      | they have, as a result of the last show, well, Apple Sculpt, that can be the next couple               |
| 49:38      | of weekends for you.                                                                                   |
| 49:40      | Yeah, I just went to the page, I hadn't been there for a while, and as soon as you open                |
| 49:44      | up, you've got to picture yourself and says, welcome to macosxautomation.com.                           |
| 49:49      | This website is not hosted by Apple Inc.                                                               |
| 49:55      | The internet makes me happy sometimes.                                                                 |
| 49:57      | Yes, sometimes.                                                                                        |
| 49:59      | All right, so you've got Podio working both on video production and magazine production.               |
| 50:06      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 50:08      | It sounds like that's kind of a backbone of your business.                                             |
| 50:11      | Yeah, pretty is.                                                                                       |
| 50:12      | Yeah, I'm just going through the minute because we just had a slight personnel change, and             |
| 50:18      | I'm looking to make a few changes in the processes, so I'm going to go through and just revamp         |
| 50:23      | that.                                                                                                  |
| 50:24      | It took quite a while to build it up, but now that I've got sort of a certain level                    |
| 50:28      | of, I wouldn't say expertise, but familiarity with it, it seems a lot easier to manage now.            |
| 50:33      | It was quite difficult in the early days, but like most of these things, you need to                   |
| 50:37      | get your head around what the concepts are and get used to some of the commands.                       |
| 50:41      | But you're currently going through or just about to start revamping our current Podio                  |
| 50:46      | pipeline for a few personnel changes.                                                                  |
| 50:49      | How friendly is Podio with Zapier?                                                                     |
| 50:53      | It's okay.                                                                                             |
| 50:54      | I must admit, that's not one of the integrations that we use a lot, although we do use that            |
| 50:58      | for the social media bits as well, I think.                                                            |
| 51:00      | Yeah, with a magazine, we create a social media entries and we take the information rather             |
| 51:07      | than from a table.                                                                                     |
| 51:08      | We actually take it from Podio.                                                                        |
| 51:10      | So it is possible, but that only runs once a month, and it's been a while since I set                  |
| 51:14      | that up.                                                                                               |
| 51:15      | No, it seems to work fine.                                                                             |
| 51:17      | It seems to work fine.                                                                                 |
| 51:18      | I confess, I have been playing with Podio and its automation so that I can have my own                 |
| 51:23      | air table base of the different things that I need to do for screencasts online, because               |
| 51:26      | of course, I have video ideas and I have article ideas and all sorts of things, and I want             |
| 51:30      | somewhere to store them.                                                                               |
| 51:32      | I've been playing with that and Zapier has a very good integration because what you can                |
| 51:37      | do is you can have it triggered based on an item being updated, but also you can look                  |
| 51:42      | up an item and get a lot more information.                                                             |
| 51:44      | So for example, whenever I get a recording assigned to me, I can go back and look up                   |
| 51:48      | the show recording and get even more information if I want or need it.                                 |
| 51:52      | And [[Make\|Integromat]] also has support, which is alternative to Zapier, and they seem to have                 |
| 51:57      | all the same options and possibly even a few more.                                                     |
| 52:00      | I haven't really dug into that yet.                                                                    |
| 52:02      | Excellent.                                                                                             |
| 52:03      | I can see we need to get our heads together on some of this Podio stuff.                               |
| 52:07      | Well, all I can say is if you're looking for something to try and do something in Zapier               |
| 52:13      | room, for some reason, that's not there.                                                               |
| 52:15      | A, ask their support.                                                                                  |
| 52:16      | Their support are very helpful and very speedy, so that's always worth talking to them because         |
| 52:21      | they often have workarounds for these things.                                                          |
| 52:24      | But if they don't have it, try [[Make\|Integromat]], because [[Make\|Integromat]] is something I've been                   |
| 52:27      | playing with.                                                                                          |
| 52:28      | We may have to do a future show on this one, David.                                                    |
| 52:29      | I know you're still getting a Zapier and regular expressions, but [[Make\|Integromat]] may be                    |
| 52:34      | in our future, because that can branch and do all sorts of things, including in their                  |
| 52:39      | free plan.                                                                                             |
| 52:40      | So yes, there's lots of options there.                                                                 |
| 52:42      | Well, it's really great that you can run a business like this.                                         |
| 52:47      | I mean, it's a relatively small business, but you've got a team and you've got things                  |
| 52:51      | happening and you don't want to depend on humans to update spreadsheets and push these                 |
| 52:58      | buttons.                                                                                               |
| 52:59      | Why not have it automatically done for you?                                                            |
| 53:01      | And I'm all for that.                                                                                  |
| 53:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 53:04      | It just takes the management overhead, you can sort of, it takes some of the stress away               |
| 53:10      | as well.                                                                                               |
| 53:11      | But I mean, the standard thing with automation is consistency and repeatability.                       |
| 53:16      | Once you've set it up, it should just run itself basically.                                            |
| 53:21      | So that's the main aim.                                                                                |
| 53:23      | One of the downsides of all this, though, is the subscription fatigue.                                 |
| 53:26      | You do, like, these services are great about giving you samples, but when you want to get              |
| 53:31      | in a little deeper to make the automation really work, you're going to have to subscribe to            |
| 53:35      | a bunch of them.                                                                                       |
| 53:36      | I'm dealing with that with the Mac Power users right now.                                              |
| 53:38      | We have a newsletter that goes out with every episode, but I'm cheap.                                  |
| 53:43      | I just signed up for the basic plan with [[Mailchimp]], but to schedule or automate sending that,          |
| 53:52      | I have to start paying the money.                                                                      |
| 53:54      | And right now, I'm like the guy on Lost where I have to go to the computer and type in the             |
| 53:59      | codes at a certain time to keep the planet.                                                            |
| 54:02      | If I want the newsletter to go out and if I want that to be automated, I have to pay.                  |
| 54:06      | So I was just telling [[Stephen Hackett\|Stephen]] the other day, I just have to suck it up and pay for this                |
| 54:11      | because it's madness.                                                                                  |
| 54:13      | Well, I always say it's the cost of doing business sometimes.                                          |
| 54:17      | It's different if it's something that you're doing as a hobby or if it's something that                |
| 54:22      | you're doing for your own personal interest.                                                           |
| 54:24      | Yeah, it becomes difficult, but as soon as it starts to save your money or as soon as                  |
| 54:27      | it starts to make the business better, it's a no-brainer at that point.                                |
| 54:33      | Yes, definitely.                                                                                       |
| 54:34      | And also for people who are looking at using these tools for personal things, do check                 |
| 54:39      | to see if maybe there are business users for it as well because if you can primarily use               |
| 54:43      | it for the business and it happens to have a personal automation alongside, check with                 |
| 54:47      | your accountant, but that could be a business expense.                                                 |
| 54:50      | That's good.                                                                                           |
| 54:51      | That was the tax corner of the automators.                                                             |
| 54:53      | Yeah, well, pay this way.                                                                              |
| 54:56      | I would say 19 out of 20 of my Zapier zaps are indeed business ones.                                   |
| 55:00      | Now, I need to double check with my accountant whether or not this will count for me as a              |
| 55:04      | business expenditure, but I'm pretty certain they're going to say yes, because I could                 |
| 55:07      | always turn off my 20th Zap and figure out how to do it with [[Make\|Integromat]].                              |
| 55:13      | What is your 20th, though?                                                                             |
| 55:14      | I want to know what you're using it for that's not business.                                           |
| 55:17      | I'm playing with some toggle timers, which technically I could probably count as business,             |
| 55:21      | but these particular ones are for [[Nintendo Switch]] playing and stuff, so you probably                   |
| 55:28      | can't count it as a business expense.                                                                  |
| 55:30      | If you look at it purely from a time tracking perspective, it totally is.                              |
| 55:35      | So if next week we find out Rosemary Orchard has a gaming podcast, we'll know why.                     |
| 55:42      | I think I might have some competition in that area.                                                    |
| 55:46      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by FreshBooks.                                            |

| 56:43      | We thank FreshBooks for their support of this show and really, AFM.                                    |
| 56:46      | All right, Don, so we've been going pretty deep on web services and pretty advanced                    |
| 56:52      | automations for your business. I thought it'd be fun to finish yourself just kind of talking           |
| 56:56      | about some of your favourite simple automations you use just to get through your day.                   |
| 57:01      | Yeah, again, it's all related to the business, I suppose.                                              |
| 57:04      | I know we had a bit of a discussion sort of pre-podcast about possibly discussing some                 |
| 57:09      | iOS automations, but to be honest, I haven't really got into iOS shortcuts.                            |
| 57:15      | I know it should have probably, but I've not really, although I use my iPhone and my iPad              |
| 57:22      | constantly, I find that for some reason, I just haven't found many use cases for the                   |
| 57:28      | automations on iOS, which is...                                                                        |
| 57:30      | Well, now's the time to get on board, man. They did a great job with the update, so                    |
| 57:34      | try it out.                                                                                            |
| 57:36      | I'll definitely have to try it again, but let's talk about some of my favourite Mac automations.        |
| 57:42      | There's an application I use called Post Haste, which is a very simple application. It's intended       |
| 57:47      | really for video editors. Basically, it allows you to create a template, a file structure              |
| 57:55      | template. Again, if we're looking at creating automated production processes, whenever we              |
| 58:02      | create a show project, there's a strict folder hierarchy, a strict folder structure that               |
| 58:08      | needs to be in place so that scripts know where to go to to find various elements.                     |
| 58:13      | Post Haste is this great free application. You basically set up a template, and when                    |
| 58:19      | you want to create a set of folders for a project, you just run Post Haste, you put in                  |
| 58:24      | some parameters, hit the button, and it will generate this beautiful folder hierarchy based            |
| 58:30      | on the parameters that you've put into the application.                                                |
| 58:33      | We do that again for the magazine and for the shows as well, creates multiple layers                   |
| 58:37      | of folders. It will rename the folders based on the parameters you put in. If you've got               |
| 58:44      | certain files that you want to be included within a folder, you can put those into the                 |
| 58:48      | template as well, so it will generate copies of those files. I just find it really, really             |
| 58:53      | useful. We use that a lot, setting up shows and setting up the magazine issues.                        |
| 58:58      | That seems almost like just an [[AppleScript]].                                                           |
| 59:01      | It could be, but it's just so simple to use. It just takes away the pain of writing the                |
| 59:05      | AppleScript. To be honest, I always find managing files and folders with AppleScript                 |
| 59:10      | is a huge pain. That's the least intuitive part of AppleScript, how you manage and                    |
| 59:17      | create folders and files. But this is great. You can set up multiple templates. I have                 |
| 59:22      | one for a video project. I have one for a magazine project. It provides some for motion                |
| 59:28      | graphics templates and video editing templates and all stuff like that. I'll patch it to               |
| 59:35      | the link for that one. It's by Pro Media Tools. It's initially or primarily a video editor's             |
| 59:40      | tool, but it's great if you find yourself wanting to create up multiple folder structures              |
| 59:45      | and want them to be all identical.                                                                     |
| 59:47      | Yeah. I'm sure there's a lot of people that could use this because if you have any type                |
| 59:51      | of project-based work and you make a set of folders every time you take on a new project,              |
| 59:57      | this automates that.                                                                                   |
| 59:59      | Yeah. As I say, you can embed within templates copies of files as well. For instance, you              |
| 01:00:05   | can, as I mentioned before, we create the preview files. I should really write the script              |
| 01:00:11   | so they come from a central place, but it was easier at the time just to have this n-stub              |
| 01:00:16   | of a preview file within a certain folder so it can go away and pull it out of that folder.            |
| 01:00:21   | It just does it basically once the template's set up. It will recreate the folder structure            |
| 01:00:24   | for you wherever you want.                                                                             |
| 01:00:26   | Nice.                                                                                                  |
| 01:00:27   | That's really useful. I've done something similar with [[Keyboard Maestro]], but I don't                   |
| 01:00:29   | have any of the parameters and so on set up. It's basically create this folder with                    |
| 01:00:33   | these three subfolders in this upper folder. That's as far as complex as I've got. Keyboard            |
| 01:00:40   | Maestro is, of course, a great tool, but it's maybe not designed for something like                    |
| 01:00:43   | this, whereas it sounds like post-haste can really go the distance there.                              |
| 01:00:48   | Yeah. Basically, if I'm creating a folder structure for a video tutorial, basically,                   |
| 01:00:55   | this is the full show number which I put in. There's a thing called the file title and                 |
| 01:01:01   | the file code. Now, the file code is just a random number of digits that we put into                   |
| 01:01:05   | the file name so that it's for security more than anything else, but basically once I put              |
| 01:01:10   | those two parameters in, it will go away and it will rename the folders based on the show              |
| 01:01:16   | number as well and it will use the file code to generate some other static files within                |
| 01:01:22   | the folder structure.                                                                                  |
| 01:01:23   | There's also a thing called a key file as well which I use in the script to pass information           |
| 01:01:28   | across to the script and it will generate a key file which is comprised of the show                    |
| 01:01:34   | number, the file code, and some other parameters that are available. You can get some quite            |
| 01:01:39   | complex and quite sophisticated folder structures with lots of information built into them just        |
| 01:01:44   | using this single tool.                                                                                |
| 01:01:46   | Yeah. Like Rose, I do this with a keyboard Maestro script, but looking through this,                   |
| 01:01:50   | there are things happening with this app that I am not doing with [[Keyboard Maestro]]. I'm                |
| 01:01:55   | going to have to check into this. Another one you've got on your list, Don, and it's                   |
| 01:02:00   | one of my favourite Mac apps, as silly as it sounds, is [[TextSoap]].                                      |
| 01:02:05   | Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I use [[TextSoap]] all the time, all the time. I use it in two                |
| 01:02:10   | ways as well. I'll use it sort of day to day. If I just want to process some text, I'll                |
| 01:02:16   | copy the text and paste it into [[TextSoap]] and that works really well and use either the                |
| 01:02:21   | built-in cleaners or a quick cleaner. But I also use it via [[AppleScript]]. So within the                |
| 01:02:28   | production scripts that we have, there are certain files. There's a HTML file that needs               |
| 01:02:32   | some code stripping out or some code replacing. There's the chapter files that we have. They           |
| 01:02:37   | come out just as pure text and I want the chapter files or the chapter names to have                   |
| 01:02:42   | an asterisk at the beginning so I can insert it into some markdown documents. We've got                |
| 01:02:46   | a little custom cleaner that does that. And these can all be called from [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]]                 |
| 01:02:52   | using the API. That's very simple to use. So yeah, [[TextSoap]] is a huge boon to me. I                   |
| 01:02:58   | use it an awful lot.                                                                                   |
| 01:02:59   | Yeah, I met the developer of [[TextSoap]] years ago. I think at Macworld.                                 |
| 01:03:03   | Yeah, I did as well actually.                                                                          |
| 01:03:05   | I forget the guy's name, but basically he has a mission in life, right? It's a single                  |
| 01:03:11   | developer application. And all he does is find ways to manipulate text on your Mac.                    |
| 01:03:17   | That's all he does with this app. But any way you can think of it immediately text, he's               |
| 01:03:22   | probably figured it out and he's built an automation. I just saw it too. This is also                  |
| 01:03:26   | available on Setapp. So if you're a Setapp subscriber, you can get it for free just while              |
| 01:03:31   | you're paying for Setapp. But there's just, honestly, if you work with text, there's no                |
| 01:03:36   | reason not to. Have you ever done that thing where you drag text off the internet and you              |
| 01:03:40   | paste it and it's got a whole bunch of code in there that you didn't want. [[TextSoap]] like              |
| 01:03:44   | one button, it's gone. Yeah, that's great.                                                             |
| 01:03:47   | Yeah. It's a guy called Mark. Mark Cohen. I remember meeting him at WWC. Actually, he                  |
| 01:03:53   | was very helpful to me as well when I first started using it because I struggled a little              |
| 01:03:57   | bit and he was kind enough to write a couple of custom cleaners for me, which was great.               |
| 01:04:03   | So he's a good guy.                                                                                    |
| 01:04:05   | I always have a soft thought for those small developers. But I mean, he also just makes                |
| 01:04:10   | it, it's a killer app. I mean, it really does the job.                                                 |
| 01:04:13   | Yes. Yeah. That's a brilliant application. In fact, we covered it quite recently on                    |
| 01:04:16   | Screencast Online. So there is a Screencast Online tutorial kicking around for [[TextSoap]].              |
| 01:04:20   | If you could give us a link, we'll put that in the show.                                               |
| 01:04:22   | Yeah, sure. No problem. No problem.                                                                    |
| 01:04:24   | There's also an iOS app, which is very similar. It's nowhere near as powerful as [[TextSoap]],            |
| 01:04:28   | but it's called Text Case. And as the name implies, it is mostly for fixing the case                   |
| 01:04:34   | of text. But if people are looking for an iOS alternative, I use this one all the time.                |
| 01:04:39   | And it's very useful.                                                                                  |
| 01:04:40   | And Text Case is shortcuts friendly. So that's another good for automation.                            |
| 01:04:45   | It doesn't have AppleScript support because it's on iOS, but it does have shortcut support.            |
| 01:04:49   | So automate all of the text. And he must be doing a lot with regular expressions. And                  |
| 01:04:55   | if you're curious about those, we did show that.                                                       |
| 01:04:59   | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 01:05:00   | Don, what's the automation white whale in your life? What's the thing you'd like to                    |
| 01:05:06   | automate that you can't seem to get to?                                                                |
| 01:05:11   | That's a terrible idea.                                                                                |
| 01:05:17   | To be honest, most things are automatable. It's just the level of effort required to                   |
| 01:05:22   | do it. I wish it was better at AppleScript. I mean, I don't use AppleScript a lot, but                 |
| 01:05:27   | the scripts that we have are written in AppleScript. I find I'm not one of these people who sort       |
| 01:05:32   | of know the ins and outs of it. If I wanted to do something, I'm one of these that will                |
| 01:05:36   | go away to the internet and search and find out if someone else has done it and how they've            |
| 01:05:40   | done it and try to understand how they've done it and then sort of turn it around that way.            |
| 01:05:44   | So yeah, another thing that surprises me as far as, although it's not strictly, well,                  |
| 01:05:49   | it is automation, I suppose, but home automation. In the early days, when I was a lot younger,         |
| 01:05:54   | I was longing for the days when we'd be able to have home automation. And I literally haven't          |
| 01:06:00   | done anything with home automation other than buy a couple of hue bulbs. And that really               |
| 01:06:04   | surprises me because it was something I was really looking to in the future. And now the               |
| 01:06:08   | future is here and we can do an awful lot with home automation. I just sort of haven't                 |
| 01:06:12   | settled down and got to grips with it. So yeah, I probably want to think a bit more                    |
| 01:06:17   | about doing some home automation stuff rather than sort of Mac or iOS automation.                      |
| 01:06:22   | Yeah, I've been in a lot of trouble for home automation, luckily, in my house. Yeah, because           |
| 01:06:27   | we've we've switched, changed all the switches out to those Lutron Casetaa switches so I              |
| 01:06:32   | can automate anything. And I always had the idea. And my wife's like, I don't understand               |
| 01:06:39   | in the middle of the night, sometimes all the lights in the house are turning on. What                 |
| 01:06:43   | have you done to our house? Literally, the house was lighting up like, and what I realised             |
| 01:06:49   | was because I had a little Pico switch in my nightstand, you know, with the idea like                  |
| 01:06:56   | if we hear a strange noise, I press a button, the whole house lights up. Well, that had                |
| 01:07:00   | slipped under something. And then I, I do, I take eyedrops. So when with my eyes closed,               |
| 01:07:08   | the switch had landed under where I store my drops. So every time I put eyedrops in,                   |
| 01:07:13   | I would either turn all the lights on in the house or turn them on.                                    |
| 01:07:18   | Oh, David.                                                                                             |
| 01:07:20   | Yeah. So it was it was a it was an interesting marital conversation, but it's all solved               |
| 01:07:26   | now. And I have a new place for that switch. That's a good idea. If I can make one recommendation,     |
| 01:07:32   | a piece of home kit equipment that's really helped me or home automation has been a motion             |
| 01:07:37   | sensor. Actually, I recently got a Phillips Hue motion sensor, and it does more than motion            |
| 01:07:41   | sensing it. It can also detect light levels and adding that as a condition to scenes of                |
| 01:07:46   | hey, you know, like, you know, if it's after 5pm and you detect motion and the light level             |
| 01:07:52   | is below like, I don't know, six blocks or something. I've still yet to figure out exactly             |
| 01:07:57   | what the light levels mean, but I'm working on it. Then turn on the lights. And so I'm                 |
| 01:08:02   | doing some tweaking at the moment, but the motion sensor has been really good. Also,                   |
| 01:08:05   | it's great when you get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and just like              |
| 01:08:08   | some dim red lights turn on that that's been very helpful because then you can see to go               |
| 01:08:13   | to the bathroom and you come back from the bathroom and then the lights just turn off like             |
| 01:08:16   | five minutes later and so good. Yeah, it's really nice, Don. I mean, the stuff they've                 |
| 01:08:21   | got now in home kit, I think it's pretty solid. I mean, I've adopted it. To me, the piece of           |
| 01:08:30   | that that still is a question mark is the security camera stuff Apple announced in June                |
| 01:08:35   | that they're going to have a new system where they're going to store video for you in a                |
| 01:08:38   | safe and secure place. It seems like the right solution, but we haven't really heard much              |
| 01:08:42   | about it since then. And that's one of the weak points of home kit automation, although                |
| 01:08:47   | there are solutions out there outside of home kit. Yeah, I think one of the things that                |
| 01:08:51   | worries me is family acceptance. That's the big thing. You need to be careful. Well, David's           |
| 01:08:57   | trick of replacing the light switches is definitely more family friendly than replacing                |
| 01:09:01   | the light bulbs because then people will randomly turn off the lights or they'll turn them on          |
| 01:09:05   | and they'll expect it to turn on. But you've used the hue feature to not turn the lights               |
| 01:09:09   | back on when they lose power because otherwise when you lose power at three o'clock in the             |
| 01:09:12   | morning, everybody is very grumpy because all the lights magically turned on. It feels                 |
| 01:09:18   | like you can't win. But the Apple store in the UK and here in Austria as well, I've noticed            |
| 01:09:22   | they relatively recently added some light switches and they also have plugs as well,                   |
| 01:09:28   | like sockets that you can replace the ones in your wall with, which I think is a much                  |
| 01:09:32   | more standard user friendly approach because then you don't lose your current functionality,           |
| 01:09:38   | you're just adding more functionality to it. Okay.                                                     |
| 01:09:42   | And the Lutron stuff, in particular, Robert Spivack, who guested on MPU, he's kind of my                |
| 01:09:46   | sensei on all this stuff. He told me, I didn't realise this, Lutron bought their own radio             |
| 01:09:53   | bandwidth and as a result, those switches are on a different frequency than most and                   |
| 01:10:01   | they've just been so rock solid. You do have to add another hub to your media closet.                  |
| 01:10:08   | And it's one more thing you have to plug in, but man, they're solid. We have them all over             |
| 01:10:12   | the house and they just work. You press the button, the lights come on. It feels like                  |
| 01:10:16   | it's an actual switch. Okay.                                                                           |
| 01:10:19   | Well, if they were available in Europe, I would probably have some. Unfortunately,                     |
| 01:10:22   | they're not. No, there are US and I believe Canada only thing. A, because you have 110                 |
| 01:10:27   | volts instead of hour 220 and B, you have different shaped light switches. Yeah. Yours                 |
| 01:10:32   | are tall and skinny and over here, we tend to have square plates. Yeah. It really is                   |
| 01:10:38   | impressive how well they work and there was no resistance from the family because nothing              |
| 01:10:44   | changed for them. They still push a button to turn the lights off and on. In fact, they                |
| 01:10:48   | adopted the automation now. I mean, my wife, when we're driving home from something, I'll              |
| 01:10:53   | always see her opening home kit and turning the lights on on the house before we get home.             |
| 01:10:56   | She's doing that as we're driving down the freeway. So I mean, she's in. Yeah.                         |
| 01:11:01   | Okay. Yeah. All right. You might have convinced me then. I'll have to look into it in a bit            |
| 01:11:04   | more detail. Look for switches. I don't know what they are over there. We'll get you back              |
| 01:11:08   | next year to talk about your home kit set up.                                                          |
| 01:11:10   | Yeah. How you make your family crazy with it.                                                          |
| 01:11:14   | Podio and home. Yeah. Podio and home kit. Yes. So whenever somebody submits a new video,               |
| 01:11:19   | all of my lights. Yeah. The lights flash it.                                                           |
| 01:11:24   | When J.F. kicks it back, everything flashes red and a collapsing goes on. Yes. Right. Well,            |
| 01:11:32   | I think that's all we've got time for today. And yes, thank you very much for coming on                |
| 01:11:36   | the show, Don. It's been an absolute pleasure to talk to you and learn all about how ScreenCast        |
| 01:11:40   | Online is actually secretly automated. Oh, well, that's been good. Yeah, it's strange                  |
| 01:11:46   | though because it's only when you start talking about it that you sort of realise just how             |
| 01:11:48   | much, you know, how far the rabbit hole you've gone. And there's lots more, you know, automations      |
| 01:11:53   | that we've got in place as well. But I don't want to blow people's minds too much.                     |
| 01:11:57   | Well, it's impressive. And it's also impressive, Don, what you've done with ScreenCast Online.         |
| 01:12:01   | I mean, it started, you said 13 years ago, helping people get better using this stuff                  |
| 01:12:07   | and you're still doing it, making two videos a week. Everybody go over and check out ScreenCast        |
| 01:12:12   | Online. It's a great resource. The nice thing is it's not just me now. We've got lovely                |
| 01:12:16   | people like Rose doing videos as well. So it's a nice mixed bag. Some great presenters                 |
| 01:12:20   | on there now. Well, it's great fun producing videos. So thank you.                                     |
| 01:12:25   | Oh, I will say that the Liverpool accent sells it, honestly. That's how I get Daisy wants              |
| 01:12:32   | to learn about the Mac. She doesn't want me to teach her. You know, it's a husband-wife                |
| 01:12:35   | thing. You don't want to hear that from your husband, right? Yeah, she loves your accent.              |
| 01:12:40   | So I just say, watch Don's video. She will watch your video. Just not mine. There we                   |
| 01:12:45   | go. Okay.                                                                                              |
