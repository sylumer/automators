|:---------- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators.                                                        |
| 00:03      | This is episode seven,                                                                   |
| 00:05      | and I am here with one of my great friends, David Sparks.                                |
| 00:09      | How are you today, David?                                                                |
| 00:10      | Excited, Rose.                                                                           |
| 00:11      | Every time I get to talk about automation,                                               |
| 00:13      | it just warms the cockles of my heart.                                                   |
| 00:17      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 00:18      | Are there cockles? I don't know.                                                         |
| 00:20      | Yeah, I think they're cockles.                                                           |
| 00:21      | If they are, then mine are very warm.                                                    |
| 00:23      | If that means something else,                                                            |
| 00:24      | then I'm just very happy to talk about automation.                                       |
| 00:26      | There we go. I mean,                                                                     |
| 00:28      | you're English, so I thought you would know.                                             |
| 00:30      | I mean, you know the Queen's English.                                                    |
| 00:32      | Yeah, off the top of my head,                                                            |
| 00:33      | it should be it warms the cockles of my heart,                                           |
| 00:35      | but I've had one of those days,                                                          |
| 00:37      | so I could be saying something completely strange.                                       |
| 00:40      | So, hey.                                                                                 |
| 00:41      | Hey, so we've got to episode seven,                                                      |
| 00:44      | and we thought we had a lot of feedback.                                                 |
| 00:46      | The forum is like blowing up,                                                            |
| 00:47      | so we thought it'd be fun to take a show                                                 |
| 00:50      | and just catch up with feedback.                                                         |
| 00:51      | Before we do, a couple of announcements.                                                 |
| 00:55      | I have been a really busy boy.                                                           |
| 00:57      | I released two field guides in a month,                                                  |
| 00:59      | which I do not recommend to anyone,                                                      |
| 01:01      | but I've got one out on [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]].                                   |
| 01:03      | It's like three hours, tons of,                                                          |
| 01:06      | it's all video screencasts about [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]],                          |
| 01:08      | and then one on [OmniFocus]() with the new version three                                 |
| 01:10      | coming out, and I have introductory pricing on them.                                     |
| 01:14      | They're $24, and I kept it open specifically                                             |
| 01:17      | for the Automator's audience,                                                            |
| 01:18      | because the way we record the show,                                                      |
| 01:20      | we hadn't recorded since all this went down.                                             |
| 01:24      | So I said, I can't raise the price yet.                                                  |
| 01:25      | I have the Automators to talk to you.                                                    |
| 01:26      | So if you're interested in [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]],                                |
| 01:29      | getting better at it, or OmniFocus three,                                                |
| 01:31      | head over to learn.macsparky.com.                                                        |
| 01:35      | And the other thing, and I'll toot Rose's horn,                                          |
| 01:38      | she wrote an amazing review of OmniFocus three                                           |
| 01:41      | on [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/), so we're gonna put that in the show notes. |
| 01:44      | So if you want to learn all about Mac,                                                   |
| 01:47      | OmniFocus three on the Mac and iOS really,                                               |
| 01:51      | you should go read that.                                                                 |
| 01:53      | Yes, thank you.                                                                          |
| 01:54      | Yeah, it's very exciting to write for [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/).         |
| 01:56      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 01:59      | Yeah, all right.                                                                         |
| 02:00      | And I think as we, you know, when we started the show,                                   |
| 02:05      | we just don't have a segment here called                                                 |
| 02:07      | State of the Automators,                                                                 |
| 02:09      | because when we started the show,                                                        |
| 02:10      | we were worried about this show                                                          |
| 02:12      | because it was something that is,                                                        |
| 02:16      | goes way geeky, you know, beyond what most podcasts do.                                  |
| 02:20      | You know, we're gonna talk about [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]].                          |
| 02:22      | We're gonna talk about creating these automation routines.                               |
| 02:24      | And that's the reason why Rose and I spend the time                                      |
| 02:26      | to make the screencast and post all the extra material                                   |
| 02:30      | so you guys can kind of pick up with this.                                               |
| 02:32      | But a lot of people told us                                                              |
| 02:34      | there's no way that show will ever work.                                                 |
| 02:35      | It's too geeky, nobody will follow it.                                                   |
| 02:37      | Well, let me tell you something.                                                         |
| 02:38      | We're into episode seven.                                                                |
| 02:40      | I was just looking at our download numbers                                               |
| 02:42      | and you are stuck with us.                                                               |
| 02:45      | Yeah, definitely stuck with us.                                                          |
| 02:46      | We're not going anywhere.                                                                |
| 02:47      | We're like limpets in a very positive manner.                                            |
| 02:50      | Yes, positive limpets.                                                                   |
| 02:52      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 02:53      | And good news, we're viable.                                                             |
| 02:55      | So we can make this show work.                                                           |
| 02:57      | Rose and I definitely want to keep it coming.                                            |
| 02:59      | We hear from the emails from you.                                                        |
| 03:01      | We read you guys in the forum.                                                           |
| 03:02      | And, you know, our goal is to make normal people                                         |
| 03:07      | able to automate their life, get home earlier,                                           |
| 03:10      | get their work done so they can do fun stuff.                                            |
| 03:12      | That's the goal for the show.                                                            |
| 03:13      | And I feel like we're pulling it off, Rose.                                              |
| 03:16      | High five, virtual high five.                                                            |
| 03:18      | Definitely virtual high five.                                                            |
| 03:20      | And also for the people who are a bit nerdier                                            |
| 03:22      | and already into this stuff to give them more ideas,                                     |
| 03:24      | because, well, if we give you ideas,                                                     |
| 03:26      | then hopefully you'll share them with us                                                 |
| 03:28      | and we can help you share with them with the world.                                      |
| 03:30      | Yes, it's really amazing to see some of the stuff                                        |
| 03:33      | that people have come up with in the forums.                                             |
| 03:34      | I am so impressed.                                                                       |
| 03:36      | Yes, I agree, I agree.                                                                   |
| 03:39      | So anything else you want to do?                                                         |
| 03:41      | Any other self-congratulatory notes we have?                                             |
| 03:45      | We're awesome.                                                                           |
| 03:46      | I think we can go with that.                                                             |
| 03:47      | Okay.                                                                                    |
| 03:48      | Yeah, let's just run with it.                                                            |
| 03:49      | Okay, [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] is out now and the iOS 12 is shipped.                |
| 03:56      | So the big question during the beta was this is great,                                   |
| 03:59      | but I can't wait to see applications support it.                                         |
| 04:02      | Oh yeah. Rose, what applications have got you excited?                                   |
| 04:06      | So many.                                                                                 |
| 04:07      | So for people who like me                                                                |
| 04:09      | or who have been trying like me to track your time,                                      |
| 04:13      | [[Shortcuts]] has toggle integration                                                     |
| 04:15      | or should be precise, toggle donates to [[Shortcuts]].                                   |
| 04:17      | So if you start a timer in Toggle,                                                       |
| 04:19      | then that will then show up as an option in [[Shortcuts]],                               |
| 04:22      | which means I've built these into a bunch                                                |
| 04:24      | of my shortcuts now.                                                                     |
| 04:27      | So that for example, when I'm sitting down                                               |
| 04:28      | to do my podcasting stuff,                                                               |
| 04:30      | as well as it's setting do not disturb until you did the event,                          |
| 04:33      | et cetera, et cetera.                                                                    |
| 04:34      | It also starts a toggle timer for tracking my podcasting time                            |
| 04:39      | so that I know how long I get to spend talking to you guys,                              |
| 04:42      | which is definitely really nice.                                                         |
| 04:44      | Have you spotted any?                                                                    |
| 04:45      | Yeah, well, let me just talk about that for a minute                                     |
| 04:48      | because I think a running theme with all this                                            |
| 04:49      | and I apologise after we just had an hour and a half show                                |
| 04:52      | with [[Matthew Cassinelli\|Matt Cassinelli]] taking apart API calls.                     |
| 04:55      | But I feel like one of the big benefits of this                                          |
| 04:58      | is this whole API nonsense is gonna be much less relevant                                |
| 05:02      | because previously I had toggle timers and workflow.                                     |
| 05:08      | In fact, if you look at my [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] field guide,                    |
| 05:10      | you see them, they're just littered                                                      |
| 05:12      | all over my [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] screen                                         |
| 05:14      | because I got one, if I'm gonna take a walk,                                             |
| 05:17      | I've got one, if I'm gonna play my sax, whatever.                                        |
| 05:20      | Where now you don't have to do API calls.                                                |
| 05:23      | Those were all before API call based,                                                    |
| 05:25      | which was a big pain in the neck to create.                                              |
| 05:27      | Now you just toggle, donates it to you,                                                  |
| 05:30      | you pull it out of the app,                                                              |
| 05:31      | and then you put it in a workflow.                                                       |
| 05:33      | So what used to be an entire workflow or Siri shortcut                                   |
| 05:37      | now is simply one step and another shortcut.                                             |
| 05:40      | And the benefit of that is then you can combine it                                       |
| 05:43      | with other things.                                                                       |
| 05:43      | I'm guessing when you sit down to podcasts,                                              |
| 05:45      | you have a Siri shortcut that says I'm going to podcasts.                                |
| 05:48      | And let me guess, it turns on do not disturb?                                            |
| 05:51      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 05:52      | It sets the timer.                                                                       |
| 05:55      | I don't know, what else does it do?                                                      |
| 05:58      | Well, it actually opens my [[OmniFocus]].                                                |
| 06:01      | I have an automators folder in [[OmniFocus]].                                            |
| 06:03      | I should mention, by the way,                                                            |
| 06:05      | that this episode is sponsored by [[Omni Group]] and [[OmniFocus]],                      |
| 06:07      | but we're not talking about it because of that.                                          |
| 06:10      | And so it does that so that I can make sure                                              |
| 06:13      | that I've got everything running.                                                        |
| 06:14      | You could have it open the quit page, right?                                             |
| 06:16      | You do that?                                                                             |
| 06:17      | Yeah, I could.                                                                           |
| 06:18      | So quit is what we use in the back end to plan the outline.                              |
| 06:21      | Yeah, and it just pops up a reminder                                                     |
| 06:25      | that I need to make sure that the ethernet cable                                         |
| 06:27      | is running all the way down the hallway                                                  |
| 06:28      | in the apartment because, well,                                                          |
| 06:31      | the Wi-Fi in our apartment is great.                                                     |
| 06:33      | It really is.                                                                            |
| 06:35      | We don't have Eero here in Austria,                                                      |
| 06:36      | so I couldn't use those.                                                                 |
| 06:37      | I've heard good things about them.                                                       |
| 06:39      | We have great Wi-Fi, but just to be sure,                                                |
| 06:41      | we have a 20-meter ethernet cable running                                                |
| 06:43      | from one end of the apartment to the bedroom                                             |
| 06:46      | where I sit and record the podcast.                                                      |
| 06:47      | And it just reminds me to go and make sure                                               |
| 06:49      | that that's plugged in.                                                                  |
| 06:51      | When I set up my home office,                                                            |
| 06:52      | I spent the money that I paid a guy                                                      |
| 06:55      | to come in and run a cable.                                                              |
| 06:57      | And it was good money spent                                                              |
| 06:59      | because my internet connection is just killer now.                                       |
| 07:02      | Yeah, I should mention,                                                                  |
| 07:03      | I did build one thing in after talking to [[Matthew Cassinelli]].                        |
| 07:06      | I actually built in checking whether or not Sunset                                       |
| 07:08      | is gonna be within two hours of recording.                                               |
| 07:11      | And if it is, I close the blinds                                                         |
| 07:13      | so that I can use the lights in the room                                                 |
| 07:17      | because otherwise, the blinds in this room                                               |
| 07:20      | are really, really loud.                                                                 |
| 07:21      | And I have home kit lighting in here.                                                    |
| 07:23      | So from my phone, I can just pick it up                                                  |
| 07:24      | and tap a button and the lights will come on,                                            |
| 07:26      | which is great.                                                                          |
| 07:27      | But then I'm sitting in front of a window,                                               |
| 07:29      | so everybody sitting in the apartment's opposite                                         |
| 07:31      | can just sort of look and watch me podcast.                                              |
| 07:33      | And I'm not a fan of that.                                                               |
| 07:35      | All right, so what we need to do                                                         |
| 07:36      | is make this podcast super successful.                                                   |
| 07:38      | I want everyone to tell two friends to listen to it.                                     |
| 07:40      | So we can make a bunch of money                                                          |
| 07:42      | and Rose can buy one of those $1,000 [[HomeKit]] blinds                                  |
| 07:46      | that just lowers automatically.                                                          |
| 07:47      | They don't even sell them in Austria                                                     |
| 07:49      | because we can't even fit blinds                                                         |
| 07:51      | to the outside of our apartment.                                                         |
| 07:52      | It's the whole thing.                                                                    |
| 07:53      | That's not really automation related,                                                    |
| 07:55      | but we did want to get to blinds                                                         |
| 07:56      | and everything, it doesn't work.                                                         |
| 07:57      | All right, well, it was a try.                                                           |
| 07:59      | I was working for you, Rose.                                                             |
| 08:00      | It's a good try.                                                                         |
| 08:01      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                              |
| 08:02      | I mean, still tell two friends to listen to this                                         |
| 08:03      | because I've been hearing good feedback from you guys.                                   |
| 08:06      | You guys like what we're doing                                                           |
| 08:08      | and it seems approachable apparently.                                                    |
| 08:11      | So that's a good thing.                                                                  |
| 08:12      | So I agree, [[Toggle]] is a really amazing time tracker,                                 |
| 08:18      | but the problem is you gotta throw a switch                                              |
| 08:20      | every time you wanna make it work.                                                       |
| 08:21      | So I've never really had much success with it,                                           |
| 08:24      | but maybe this is the answer.                                                            |
| 08:27      | Yeah, well, combining the [[Toggle]] into my shortcuts                                   |
| 08:30      | and then having [[Launch Center Pro]],                                                   |
| 08:32      | which is getting a 3.0 update soon, they're working on it.                               |
| 08:36      | And I'm on the beta, it's very shiny.                                                    |
| 08:39      | So that you can get the location                                                         |
| 08:42      | or time-based push notifications                                                         |
| 08:44      | to remind you to run your shortcuts is really useful.                                    |
| 08:46      | So when I get to work, it's like,                                                        |
| 08:48      | hey, you should probably clock in now.                                                   |
| 08:49      | And when I clock in, it also starts my [[Toggle]] timer.                                 |
| 08:52      | Though theoretically the Toggle timer is redundant,                                      |
| 08:54      | but still.                                                                               |
| 08:56      | I need to, I'm just gonna ask you on air,                                                |
| 08:58      | will you tell those guys to send me an invite?                                           |
| 09:00      | I would like to get in on that.                                                          |
| 09:01      | I need to go to [[Launch Center Pro]].                                                   |
| 09:03      | I haven't used [[Launch Center Pro\|Launch Center]] for a long time.                     |
| 09:04      | I think it's time to give that one another try.                                          |
| 09:08      | Okay, I'll tell you an app                                                               |
| 09:09      | that I'm really excited about is [[Carrot Weather]].                                     |
| 09:12      | And it's dumb, right?                                                                    |
| 09:13      | It's a weather app that makes snarky comments,                                           |
| 09:15      | but they've been very Siri shortcut friendly.                                            |
| 09:18      | And all that stuff we've talked about                                                    |
| 09:20      | with weather stuff on the last episode,                                                  |
| 09:22      | I think a lot of that will be able to get out of [[Carrot Weather]]                      |
| 09:25      | without having to go to an API call.                                                     |
| 09:27      | Yes, and actually, [[Carrot Weather]], it has a choice.                                  |
| 09:31      | You can pay an extra subscription                                                        |
| 09:33      | to use [[Weather Underground]],                                                              |
| 09:34      | but by default it uses [[Dark Sky]],                                                         |
| 09:36      | which is exactly the same API                                                            |
| 09:37      | we were talking about in the last episode.                                               |
| 09:39      | So I should really, instead of calling the [[Dark Sky]] API,                                 |
| 09:43      | see if I can get the sunset time out of [[Carrot Weather\|Carrot]].                                           |
| 09:46      | Well, that's my homework for this week.                                                  |
| 09:47      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 09:48      | No, I don't think it's gonna be that difficult.                                          |
| 09:51      | I feel like we started this show,                                                        |
| 09:52      | and this is a very self-congratulatory episode gang                                      |
| 09:55      | because Rose and I, in my mind, I felt like,                                             |
| 09:58      | okay, after we do this a couple of months,                                               |
| 10:00      | we have to check in to see if anybody cares.                                             |
| 10:02      | And I'm very happy.                                                                      |
| 10:03      | I looked at the numbers this morning,                                                    |
| 10:04      | I had a look, and I'm like, hey,                                                         |
| 10:06      | there's a lot of people listening,                                                       |
| 10:07      | and that's really great.                                                                 |
| 10:08      | So that's very excited.                                                                  |
| 10:12      | But I want to, I do want to try and simplify                                             |
| 10:15      | this stuff where we can,                                                                 |
| 10:16      | and I believe using [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]],                                                      |
| 10:19      | as opposed to API calls,                                                                 |
| 10:20      | is a great way to get folks                                                              |
| 10:21      | that normally wouldn't want to deal with this stuff on board.                            |
| 10:25      | Yeah, and for some things,                                                               |
| 10:26      | you'll still want to use an API.                                                         |
| 10:28      | It's not that APIs are dead.                                                             |
| 10:29      | They're all over the web.                                                                |
| 10:30      | They're not going away anytime soon.                                                     |
| 10:32      | But if you can make this easier now,                                                     |
| 10:34      | instead of having 20 actions                                                             |
| 10:35      | to start at Toggle Shortcut, you have one.                                               |
| 10:38      | Like, that's better for everybody involved.                                              |
| 10:41      | And also, it's directly supported by [[Toggle]]                                              |
| 10:43      | and all of that.                                                                         |
| 10:45      | And it does it in the app,                                                               |
| 10:46      | which I believe means that if you are offline,                                           |
| 10:48      | then you will still be able to start timers with [[Shortcuts]]                               |
| 10:51      | that you may struggle to get Siri to trigger it                                          |
| 10:53      | if you are not online.                                                                   |
| 10:54      | Yeah, and then like [[OmniFocus]] and [[Ulysses]],                                               |
| 10:57      | there's a bunch of apps that just,                                                       |
| 10:59      | we're already pretty good players with [[Workflow]]                                          |
| 11:02      | that are just even deeper                                                                |
| 11:03      | and now that we have [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]].                                                     |
| 11:05      | Yes, and oh, one of my favourites, though, is [[Overcast]].                                  |
| 11:08      | Marco has done a great job with [[Overcast]].                                                |
| 11:11      | And they're, oh my gosh,                                                                 |
| 11:13      | I can't remember how many different ones there are.                                      |
| 11:16      | There's a bunch of default ones,                                                         |
| 11:18      | which is go back by a certain number of seconds,                                         |
| 11:20      | go forward by a certain number of seconds,                                               |
| 11:21      | play Paul's previous podcast, next podcast,                                              |
| 11:25      | setting speed, and then of course,                                                       |
| 11:27      | you get donated ones based on the actual podcasts                                        |
| 11:30      | that you're listening to.                                                                |
| 11:31      | So for example, one of mine says,                                                        |
| 11:33      | play [[Free Agents]] or play [[Mac Power Users]]                                                 |
| 11:36      | or play [[Cortex]] because those are some of the podcasts                                    |
| 11:38      | they listen to most frequently                                                           |
| 11:40      | or in [[Cortex\|Cortex's]] case, try to listen to most frequently.                                   |
| 11:43      | Yeah, no, it's great.                                                                    |
| 11:45      | And yeah, so I don't know.                                                               |
| 11:47      | It's like very exciting times.                                                           |
| 11:49      | And I think that this stuff is only gonna give it arm.                                   |
| 11:52      | I'm just so happy with the way                                                           |
| 11:54      | the workflow acquisition went down.                                                      |
| 11:56      | Yes, it could have been so terrible.                                                     |
| 11:59      | I did wonder, there were dark days where we all wondered,                                |
| 12:02      | is this the end of workflow?                                                             |
| 12:04      | Is it one day just going to disappear?                                                   |
| 12:06      | We're not gonna hear anything.                                                           |
| 12:08      | And to see it being demoed on stage at [[WWDC]],                                             |
| 12:12      | I will grant you, I was in another room                                                  |
| 12:13      | watching it being live streamed with a bunch of nerds                                    |
| 12:15      | who kept looking at me like I was some crazy girl                                        |
| 12:18      | because I was going, this is workflow.                                                   |
| 12:21      | Yeah, this, it's amazing.                                                                |
| 12:23      | I am so happy to see that we can get,                                                    |
| 12:26      | we're not just the people who want to bring this                                         |
| 12:27      | to everybody, Apple wants to bring it to everybody.                                      |
| 12:30      | That's amazing.                                                                          |
| 12:32      | So how many are you starting with your voice?                                            |
| 12:36      | More now that I bought a HomePod.                                                        |
| 12:38      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 12:39      | So, and you may have heard at the end of the last episode,                               |
| 12:42      | [[Matthew Cassinelli]] told me to buy a HomePod                                          |
| 12:44      | and you're not supposed to be able to buy them                                           |
| 12:46      | in here in Austria, they're not for sale                                                 |
| 12:48      | because Austrian German is not supported.                                                |
| 12:50      | I don't care.                                                                            |
| 12:51      | I talked to my devices in British English                                                |
| 12:52      | and I found that there was a [[HomePod]],                                                    |
| 12:54      | theoretically secondhand on a website,                                                   |
| 12:57      | it's kind of like Best Buy.                                                              |
| 12:58      | So I ordered it, I went and I picked it up                                               |
| 13:00      | and I really, really like it                                                             |
| 13:02      | and I'm triggering a lot more things now with my voice                                   |
| 13:05      | than I was previously between that                                                       |
| 13:08      | and my series for Apple Watch.                                                           |
| 13:10      | This month may have been a little expensive.                                             |
| 13:13      | I did, did you get it already?                                                           |
| 13:15      | Yeah, I got it on lunch day.                                                             |
| 13:17      | Oh, I got lunch day and it's really nice.                                                |
| 13:20      | I have to say the big screen is also good                                                |
| 13:22      | because then if you had had workflow,                                                    |
| 13:25      | then you would be able to press the buttons                                              |
| 13:26      | but with other applications,                                                             |
| 13:28      | actually being able to see what you're doing is pretty nice.                             |
| 13:30      | 40 or 44?                                                                                |
| 13:32      | 40, because my wrist is tiny                                                             |
| 13:34      | and this is basically the size of my wrist anyway.                                       |
| 13:37      | But it's really nice because now I have the race to speak                                |
| 13:40      | and all of that and I should probably have my watch                                      |
| 13:43      | and do not disturb so that doesn't happen.                                               |
| 13:45      | Well, you gotta add that to your series shortcut.                                        |
| 13:48      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 13:49      | I actually can't, I don't think you can do that.                                         |
| 13:51      | You can't specify which device                                                           |
| 13:52      | do not disturb should be started on.                                                     |
| 13:54      | That is something I would very much like to see.                                         |
| 13:56      | Although there is a setting on the watch to mirror the phone.                            |
| 13:59      | So if you set the phone to do DND,                                                       |
| 14:01      | then the watch would do it automatically, presumably.                                    |
| 14:04      | Yeah, well, I thought I would set up to mirror.                                          |
| 14:07      | Maybe that setting got lost with the new watch.                                          |
| 14:09      | Yes, so yeah, I'm triggering a lot more now                                              |
| 14:11      | between the two of those                                                                 |
| 14:12      | because before with triggering it on my watch,                                           |
| 14:14      | I had a series two, which is pretty good.                                                |
| 14:17      | But you know, you try and trigger it                                                     |
| 14:18      | and then it would say communicating.                                                     |
| 14:22      | And then there would be this really long pause                                           |
| 14:24      | with like some dots going across your screen.                                            |
| 14:26      | And then eventually [[Siri]] would come back and go,                                         |
| 14:29      | I was unable to communicate.                                                             |
| 14:31      | Thank you.                                                                               |
| 14:32      | I've just wasted five minutes of my life here.                                           |
| 14:34      | And who ever would have thought that on a show about automation,                         |
| 14:38      | there'd be a relevant discussion about the [[HomePod]],                                      |
| 14:40      | but there definitely is because                                                          |
| 14:42      | Oh yeah, there it is.                                                                    |
| 14:42      | Now you can trigger all this stuff with [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]].                   |
| 14:45      | So much so, so I had a single [[HomePod]]                                                    |
| 14:47      | and when I set up my home office,                                                        |
| 14:49      | I moved it, I moved the [[HomePod]] to that room.                                            |
| 14:52      | And we had a [[Sonos Play 5]],                                                               |
| 14:54      | which is a nice speaker in the bedroom.                                                  |
| 14:57      | And I just realised, you know what?                                                      |
| 14:58      | I need [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] in the bedroom as well.                             |
| 15:01      | I like to get the news in the morning                                                    |
| 15:03      | and I like to trigger different things through automation.                               |
| 15:07      | So I just sold the Sonos on eBay                                                         |
| 15:09      | and I'm adding a [[HomePod]].                                                                |
| 15:12      | So now I'm gonna have two.                                                               |
| 15:13      | Katie wins, she, Katie Floyd has three.                                                  |
| 15:15      | So I think eventually I have to get the three                                            |
| 15:17      | I have to keep up with her.                                                              |
| 15:19      | But I'm gonna have two, crazy.                                                           |
| 15:22      | Well, I have not been feeding my [[HomePod]].                                                |
| 15:24      | It is not tripled yet.                                                                   |
| 15:25      | It is not more than one [[HomePod]].                                                         |
| 15:27      | It's sitting on one side of my desk                                                      |
| 15:29      | and I have a Sonos one sitting on a bookcase                                             |
| 15:31      | on the other side of my desk.                                                            |
| 15:32      | And that's really nice.                                                                  |
| 15:35      | It's Sonos one, not a Play one.                                                          |
| 15:36      | It's got [[Alexa]] built-in, which is nice.                                                  |
| 15:38      | And I'm very sorry if I just triggered you.                                              |
| 15:42      | But yes.                                                                                 |
| 15:43      | We had some interesting automations show up                                              |
| 15:47      | in various places on the internet following our show.                                    |
| 15:50      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 15:51      | You wanna talk about some of those?                                                      |
| 15:53      | Yeah, so in case you are not aware,                                                      |
| 15:56      | we do have a forum at [talk.automators.fm](https://talk.automators.fm)                                                 |
| 15:59      | and for every episode, I have an automation with [[Zapier]]                                  |
| 16:04      | which automatically creates a new thread                                                 |
| 16:07      | so that you can talk about it.                                                           |
| 16:09      | And in that first thread, there are a bunch of things.                                   |
| 16:12      | I'm just gonna link the thread                                                           |
| 16:14      | because there's all sorts of things.                                                     |
| 16:16      | In fact, I'll link all of the threads                                                    |
| 16:17      | from all of our first shows                                                              |
| 16:20      | leading up to this episode in the show notes                                             |
| 16:23      | because there were recommendations                                                       |
| 16:24      | [[Sal Soghoian]] of all people created an [[AppleScript]]                                |
| 16:28      | to parse just the column in [[Numbers]]                                                  |
| 16:31      | to add the events to your calendar.                                                      |
| 16:33      | So the automation I shared with the spreadsheets                                         |
| 16:36      | where you can make things which is great                                                 |
| 16:37      | because then you can add two weeks to a previous date                                    |
| 16:41      | if you want to add a bunch of events.                                                    |
| 16:44      | He can add that directly to [[Apple Calendar\|calendar]].                                                    |
| 16:46      | That was something I tried and failed to do                                              |
| 16:48      | so I'm really glad somebody else did that.                                               |
| 16:51      | Several people mentioned,                                                                |
| 16:52      | of course, don't necessarily automate this.                                              |
| 16:54      | Somebody else has already done that.                                                     |
| 16:56      | Subscribe to their automation instead                                                    |
| 16:58      | which is a great suggestion                                                              |
| 16:59      | and also there's a great application                                                     |
| 17:01      | which we forgot to mention, [[Calendar Paste]],                                              |
| 17:03      | which is a really lovely application.                                                    |
| 17:06      | It's for calendar event templates basically.                                             |
| 17:10      | So yes, that was episode one essentially                                                 |
| 17:15      | which was really good.                                                                   |
| 17:16      | When you get [[Sal Soghoian]] contributing                                                  |
| 17:19      | to your user feedback, I think we're doing okay.                                         |
| 17:22      | Yeah, that was kind of amazing, I have to say                                            |
| 17:26      | that was really good feedback                                                            |
| 17:29      | to have somebody really expand upon what we've done.                                     |
| 17:31      | And if you have an expansion on what you've done                                         |
| 17:33      | to one of our workflows or automations                                                   |
| 17:37      | and you want to share it, please, please do.                                             |
| 17:39      | You can either do it as thread                                                           |
| 17:40      | or post it in the comments of the episode                                                |
| 17:46      | because that's the place for it.                                                         |
| 17:49      | Yeah, and in addition to,                                                                |
| 17:52      | and I guess I should just remind us                                                      |
| 17:54      | as we're making this victory lap episode,                                                |
| 17:58      | in addition to the forum,                                                                |
| 18:00      | you can go to [the YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@automators56)                                                        |
| 18:02      | where we're posting all the screen casts of all this stuff                               |
| 18:05      | and also over at learn.macsparky either                                                  |
| 18:08      | is a course called Automators.                                                           |
| 18:10      | And so you can subscribe to that.                                                        |
| 18:12      | We're putting it in so many different places                                             |
| 18:14      | so you'll get it everywhere.                                                             |
| 18:15      | Yeah, the one on learn.macsparky, he's really nice                                       |
| 18:18      | because it's using all of the wonderful technology                                       |
| 18:22      | behind that and it's also very good                                                      |
| 18:24      | if you're not so much of a fan of [[YouTube]].                                               |
| 18:26      | Personally, I'm fine with [[YouTube]],                                                       |
| 18:28      | but we did get feedback from some people                                                 |
| 18:29      | that they didn't like it.                                                                |
| 18:31      | Yeah, and it doesn't throw any ads at you or anything,                                   |
| 18:34      | you just get the stuff and it's downloadable.                                            |
| 18:36      | We give you the ability to download all the videos                                       |
| 18:38      | so you can put on your device.                                                           |
| 18:41      | This episode of Automators is brought to you                                             |
| 18:43      | by the Omni Group, makers of OmniFocus.                                                  |
| 18:47      | OmniFocus 3 was released this week for Mac OS                                            |
| 18:50      | and it with OmniFocus 3 for iOS is a fresh                                               |
| 18:53      | and major update to an app that has been                                                 |
| 18:55      | the trusted gold standard to do app for 10 years.                                        |
| 18:58      | So it's the very first day of the app store.                                             |
| 19:00      | It is the best OmniFocus ever.                                                           |
| 19:02      | And I can say that in full confidence                                                    |
| 19:04      | because I choose to use OmniFocus.                                                       |
| 19:05      | I don't use it because they sponsor the show.                                            |
| 19:08      | So you can now use tags instead of context.                                              |
| 19:12      | Previously, there was one context per task or project.                                   |
| 19:15      | Now you can have tags and you can have as many tags                                      |
| 19:18      | as you like, create tags for people, energy levels,                                      |
| 19:21      | priorities, locations and much more.                                                     |
| 19:25      | You can also look into the forecast view                                                 |
| 19:27      | which now shows you your tasks                                                           |
| 19:29      | and your calendar events in chronological order                                          |
| 19:32      | so that you can see, oh, next week is coming at you,                                     |
| 19:35      | better get ahead.                                                                        |
| 19:37      | There are also enhanced repeating tasks.                                                 |
| 19:40      | On iOS, batch editing has been brought over from the Mac                                 |
| 19:43      | and you can set due dates, tags and other data                                           |
| 19:46      | for multiple tasks all at the same time.                                                 |
| 19:48      | What better way to automate things?                                                      |
| 19:51      | You can also use flexible inspectors on iOS                                              |
| 19:53      | which only show you the data you want.                                                   |
| 19:55      | And of course on the Mac,                                                                |
| 19:56      | you can just collapse any areas in the inspector                                         |
| 19:58      | that you don't want to see.                                                              |
| 20:00      | OmniFocus even has its own website                                                       |

| 20:10      | and how we make it work for them.                                                        |

| 20:16      | That's OmniFocus.                                                                        |

| 20:19      | Our thanks to the Omni Group for their support                                           |
| 20:21      | of this show and Relay FM.                                                               |
| 20:24      | Rose, let's talk a little bit about                                                      |
| 20:25      | where we're going with all this.                                                         |
| 20:27      | Because for the longest time,                                                            |
| 20:31      | or I guess the last few months,                                                          |
| 20:32      | we've been very eagerly anticipating [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]].                      |
| 20:35      | So going forward,                                                                        |
| 20:36      | we are definitely going to cover [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]]                           |
| 20:38      | a lot on this show.                                                                      |
| 20:40      | But there's other things on the horizon                                                  |
| 20:42      | that are looking really good.                                                            |
| 20:45      | I think we're going to try                                                               |
| 20:47      | and get into some of the other iOS automation tools.                                     |
| 20:50      | [[Launch Center Pro]] is a good example.                                                      |
| 20:53      | [[Scriptable]] is an app that has just kind of come out of nowhere                           |
| 20:56      | and [[Scriptable]] is an app that allows you to write                                        |
| 21:00      | [[JavaScript]] for your iOS device.                                                          |
| 21:04      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 21:05      | And implement it.                                                                        |
| 21:06      | Yeah, it's great because it hooks into so many                                           |
| 21:08      | of the APIs that are already there.                                                      |
| 21:09      | So for example, you can get calendar information out                                     |
| 21:12      | and things like that                                                                     |
| 21:13      | and present it directly to yourself in the [[Siri]] interface.                               |
| 21:16      | So if there's an automation that you want                                                |
| 21:18      | that you can't find,                                                                     |
| 21:19      | well, you can program it yourself                                                        |
| 21:21      | but you don't need to write an application for it                                        |
| 21:24      | because [[Simon Støvring\|Simon]], the creator of [[Scriptable]]                         |
| 21:28      | has done that for you, which is really nice.                                             |
| 21:30      | And I think if you were going to learn a programming language,                           |
| 21:32      | you could do pretty well with [[JavaScript]].                                                |
| 21:36      | Oh yeah.                                                                                 |
| 21:36      | It's usable across platforms.                                                            |
| 21:39      | The [[Omni Group]], all the automation they're doing                                         |
| 21:41      | is [[JavaScript]] based.                                                                     |
| 21:44      | If you want to add on for this podcast,                                                  |
| 21:48      | go to a level deeper,                                                                    |
| 21:50      | I would spend a little time learning [[JavaScript]].                                         |
| 21:53      | There's, I really think Rose should make a course on it.                                 |
| 21:56      | And if you agree with me, you should tell her                                            |
| 21:58      | but that's just me.                                                                      |
| 22:01      | But Rose, where would you recommend people go                                            |
| 22:02      | to learn [[JavaScript]] now if they wanted to?                                               |
| 22:05      | I mean, that's the difficulty that I've been finding.                                    |
| 22:08      | I learned [[JavaScript]] through necessity.                                                  |
| 22:11      | I developed for the web                                                                  |
| 22:12      | and I started out knowing a bit of [[PHP]] and [[HTML]]                                          |
| 22:15      | and realised that was not enough                                                         |
| 22:17      | and I needed to learn [[JavaScript]].                                                        |
| 22:20      | But the problem with [[JavaScript]] for automation                                           |
| 22:21      | is you don't have the document                                                           |
| 22:24      | which is the web page that you're viewing.                                               |
| 22:28      | So I would suggest that for the time being,                                              |
| 22:30      | people start with looking at example scripts                                             |
| 22:35      | just like how I learned [[AppleScript]].                                                     |
| 22:37      | Find example scripts,                                                                    |
| 22:39      | wait, be that [[JavaScript]] for automation scripts,                                         |
| 22:41      | be that Omni]] Omni automation scripts for [[OmniOutliner]]                                        |
| 22:44      | or [[OmniGraffle]] and hopefully very soon [[OmniFocus]]                                        |
| 22:46      | or scriptable scripts and pick it apart.                                                 |
| 22:49      | And there are some, I'll put some links in the show notes                                |
| 22:53      | of places that have good [[JavaScript]] for web courses.                                     |
| 22:58      | Just bear in mind that a lot of these things                                             |
| 23:00      | they'll be telling you, like,                                                            |
| 23:01      | when somebody clicks on this button,                                                     |
| 23:03      | well, you might not have a button to click on                                            |
| 23:05      | because you might not have a way to display that button.                                 |
| 23:07      | So that's something you have to keep in mind.                                            |
| 23:10      | I would also add to that if you want to start                                            |
| 23:13      | from the basics, I learned it going through                                              |
| 23:15      | [the Linda courses](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/), which I thought were pretty good.                                     |
| 23:17      | And [Code Academy](https://codecademy.com) is another good website,                                                |
| 23:20      | [codeacademy.com](https://codeacademy.com).                                                                         |
| 23:22      | So if you're, you could start from zero                                                  |
| 23:24      | with this stuff and pick it up.                                                          |
| 23:25      | It's not rocket science.                                                                 |
| 23:27      | And it's not like to me the level of [[Xcode]].                                             |
| 23:31      | It's more democratic than that.                                                          |
| 23:34      | So if you want to pick it up from zero, do it.                                           |
| 23:38      | Maybe make that a little hobby.                                                          |
| 23:41      | You spend 30 minutes a day for a month                                                   |
| 23:43      | and then you'll be fine at it.                                                           |
| 23:45      | But that's something to think about going forward.                                       |
| 23:47      | So we're going to do a whole episode.                                                    |
| 23:49      | We're playing on the [[Scriptable]] app                                                      |
| 23:50      | because you can [[JavaScript]] your way to fame and fortune                                  |
| 23:54      | on your iOS devices.                                                                     |
| 23:55      | And that's like another level above [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]].                                      |
| 23:59      | I mean, it just gives you more power.                                                    |
| 24:01      | And I think that's something                                                             |
| 24:02      | we definitely want to talk about.                                                        |
| 24:03      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 24:04      | The other thing I should mention                                                         |
| 24:05      | with [[Scriptable]] is it is free.                                                           |
| 24:07      | So if you're not sure about it and you think,                                            |
| 24:09      | well, maybe I can do something with [[JavaScript]],                                          |
| 24:12      | do download it.                                                                          |
| 24:13      | There are a bunch of sample scripts inside                                               |
| 24:15      | that do things like camp down to midnight,                                               |
| 24:17      | check whether or not [[Slack]] is up or down,                                                |
| 24:18      | usually down, all sorts of things.                                                       |
| 24:21      | And that's a good way to get some nice examples                                          |
| 24:25      | to get started.                                                                          |
| 24:26      | And you can go in there and write the script.                                            |
| 24:29      | You can take the demo scripts in there                                                   |
| 24:31      | and start fiddling with them.                                                            |
| 24:32      | And you can learn stuff as well.                                                         |
| 24:33      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                           |
| 24:34      | Yeah, so that's a great place to get started.                                            |
| 24:37      | And it's free.                                                                           |
| 24:37      | If you appreciate it, though, there is a tip jar                                         |
| 24:39      | which I have most definitely used                                                        |
| 24:41      | because I very much appreciate the app.                                                  |
| 24:43      | Yeah, and like I said, just,                                                             |
| 24:46      | I mean, this is just a hypothetical,                                                     |
| 24:47      | but wouldn't be a great idea                                                             |
| 24:48      | if Rose taught us all [[JavaScript]].                                                        |
| 24:50      | I'm just saying.                                                                         |
| 24:51      | I feel like I might be being,                                                            |
| 24:53      | or having my arm twisted a little bit.                                                   |
| 24:55      | Yeah, I don't know.                                                                      |
| 24:56      | I mean, if enough people tell me to, then I'll do it.                                    |
| 24:59      | All right, the other thing that we're going to do                                        |
| 25:03      | is we're gonna get into web automation going forward.                                    |
| 25:05      | I feel like we covered the basics so far.                                                |
| 25:07      | We wanna expand our horizons a little bit.                                               |
| 25:11      | Things like Zapier and if this, then that.                                               |
| 25:13      | And some of these other services,                                                        |
| 25:14      | we wanna get super nerdy on that.                                                        |
| 25:16      | So we have a lot planned going forward                                                   |
| 25:19      | and we're really happy that we have an audience                                          |
| 25:24      | and we can keep doing this.                                                              |
| 25:26      | Yes, another thing for going forward.                                                    |
| 25:29      | I have a test Android.                                                                   |
| 25:31      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 25:32      | It's a Nokia, it's running stock Android.                                                |
| 25:35      | It is currently running Android 8.                                                       |
| 25:36      | I will be upgrading it to Android 9,                                                     |
| 25:38      | hopefully this weekend.                                                                  |
| 25:40      | That's my weekend project.                                                               |
| 25:41      | And I would really, really like to hear                                                  |
| 25:44      | how people are automating their Androids.                                                |
| 25:46      | Yes, at the moment I own [[Tasker]] and [[Automate]]                                             |
| 25:49      | and I've been playing with both of them.                                                 |
| 25:50      | But I'd like to see what sort of things                                                  |
| 25:52      | other people are doing, how they're doing it,                                            |
| 25:54      | any problems they've run into.                                                           |
| 25:55      | There is an Android section of the Automators forum                                      |
| 25:58      | and at the moment it's quite bare.                                                       |
| 26:00      | So I very much like to see some people telling me                                        |
| 26:03      | what I can do with that in there.                                                        |
| 26:05      | Just because the more I can learn, the better.                                           |
| 26:08      | And then we can share that on the podcast too.                                           |
| 26:10      | We are not iOS and Mac exclusive.                                                        |
| 26:12      | We are very happy to share cross-platform things.                                        |
| 26:14      | Yeah, and I forgot to mention when we talked about [[Scriptable]],                           |
| 26:17      | we are the unofficial host of the [[Scriptable]] forum too.                                  |
| 26:21      | So there's a lot of the developers in there all the time                                 |
| 26:26      | and a lot of users in there talking about [[Scriptable]].                                    |
| 26:28      | So that's just one more reason to sign up at the forum.                                  |
| 26:32      | Most definitely.                                                                         |
| 26:33      | All right, there's some people in the forum                                              |
| 26:36      | that are super active and I think we should point out                                    |
| 26:39      | a couple of users you guys should be following.                                          |
| 26:41      | Yes, so I have some handles here and some names.                                         |
| 26:46      | So I think I'm pronouncing this correctly.                                               |
| 26:49      | Sylumer, his name is [[Stephen Millard]],                                                |
| 26:52      | according to his public profile.                                                         |
| 26:54      | And Rob and Jared or iBanks have all been especially helpful.                            |
| 26:59      | I've noticed some sharing lots of really great things.                                   |
| 27:02      | Example scripts, helping people debug, things like that.                                 |
| 27:05      | That is really, really helpful                                                           |
| 27:06      | and we are very appreciative of everybody                                                |
| 27:09      | who's helping out in the forums                                                          |
| 27:11      | just because it makes it a really nice place to hang out.                                |
| 27:14      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 27:16      | What about this thing, Rose,                                                             |
| 27:18      | with triggering shortcuts with [[NFC]]?                                                      |
| 27:21      | Yeah, so this kind of flew under the radar                                               |
| 27:24      | at the latest iPhone announcement.                                                       |
| 27:26      | And as of, I believe it was the iPhone 7,                                                |
| 27:29      | the iPhone's got [[NFC]] and the ability to read tags.                                       |
| 27:32      | That was possibly released, I want to say,                                               |
| 27:35      | that was released with iOS 11 last year.                                                 |
| 27:37      | The iPhone 7 could read [[NFC]].                                                             |
| 27:41      | So of course, it was there with the iPhone 8 and 10 as well.                             |
| 27:44      | But you had to unlock your phone,                                                        |
| 27:46      | open a specific application, read the [[NFC]] tag                                            |
| 27:48      | and then confirm the action.                                                             |
| 27:51      | Quite lengthy.                                                                           |
| 27:54      | iPhone 10S, 10S Max and 10R.                                                             |
| 27:59      | Yes, I did not say X.                                                                    |
| 28:01      | I have the option that they can read [[NFC]] tags                                            |
| 28:05      | without the user doing something.                                                        |
| 28:07      | Now, they won't execute any actions.                                                     |
| 28:09      | So from a security perspective,                                                          |
| 28:11      | this is not too much of a problem.                                                       |
| 28:12      | The most it's going to do is pop up a notification                                       |
| 28:14      | on your screen saying, hey, do you want to run this?                                     |
| 28:16      | But what this means is, for example,                                                     |
| 28:19      | if you have an [[NFC]] tag in the phone holder in your car,                                  |
| 28:23      | every time you put your phone in it,                                                     |
| 28:24      | it will prompt you to run a driving shortcut,                                            |
| 28:26      | which would then perhaps start your favourite                                            |
| 28:28      | podcast playlist and put your phone                                                      |
| 28:31      | in do not stir while driving mode,                                                       |
| 28:33      | send a message to your best friend saying                                                |
| 28:36      | that you're on your way, things like that,                                               |
| 28:38      | which is really nice for automation.                                                     |
| 28:41      | It won't do anything entirely by itself.                                                 |
| 28:43      | And of course, you can execute these same things with [[Siri]].                              |
| 28:46      | You can say, hello, lady, please do this.                                                |
| 28:50      | But not having to remember to say that,                                                  |
| 28:53      | prompting you to do that,                                                                |
| 28:54      | this is an extra sort of thing for launch centre pro                                     |
| 28:58      | is where it will pop up and remind you                                                   |
| 29:00      | that you wanted to run this.                                                             |
| 29:01      | So you could have tags stuck on your desktop work                                        |
| 29:03      | and so on, all sorts of things.                                                          |
| 29:06      | Yeah, and so the idea is you get a couple of these tags                                  |
| 29:13      | and they're separately.                                                                  |
| 29:14      | I've never worked with one,                                                              |
| 29:15      | but as I understand,                                                                     |
| 29:16      | they're separately identifiable to the phone.                                            |
| 29:19      | So you could have a reminder related to your house,                                      |
| 29:22      | remind to your car, remind to your work, whatever.                                       |
| 29:24      | And I'm gonna order some of these things.                                                |
| 29:27      | So I've got the new phone and see what I can do with this.                               |
| 29:30      | So we'll be covering that going forward as well.                                         |
| 29:33      | You're definitely going to have to report back                                           |
| 29:34      | because I have an iPhone 10 and I very much like it.                                     |
| 29:37      | So I've decided that this year I'm not upgrading.                                        |
| 29:40      | We're gonna see how long I held out for,                                                 |
| 29:42      | hopefully until next year.                                                               |
| 29:44      | And so you're gonna have to report back,                                                 |
| 29:46      | but I know we use NFC tags a lot at work.                                                |
| 29:48      | Our security team use them                                                               |
| 29:50      | and they use that to verify which actual locations                                       |
| 29:54      | they have checked in as part of their security rounds                                    |
| 29:56      | in what order and it looks at with a timestamp.                                          |
| 29:59      | So that's quite cool.                                                                    |
| 30:01      | Though they're not using iPhones, they're using androids,                                |
| 30:03      | but it all counts, right?                                                                |
| 30:05      | All right, well, we've got things are going great                                        |
| 30:09      | with the Automators.                                                                     |
| 30:10      | We got a lot we're looking forward to.                                                   |
| 30:11      | Anything else we need to talk about today?                                               |
| 30:13      | I don't think so.                                                                        |
| 30:15      | Other than if you have cool workflows to share                                           |
| 30:17      | and by workflows I mean any kind of automation                                           |
| 30:20      | on any platform, please share it in the forums.                                          |
| 30:23      | Similarly, if you want to ask us a question,                                             |
| 30:25      | the best place to ask it is in the forums                                                |
| 30:27      | because then it's not just ours on it,                                                   |
| 30:29      | but the eyes of all of those lovely,                                                     |
| 30:30      | helpful people in the forums.                                                            |
| 30:32      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 30:33      | You have really been making the forums                                                   |
| 30:35      | the great place that they are.                                                           |
| 30:37      | All right, well, we'll see you in two weeks                                              |
| 30:39      | with some new content and can't wait to see you then.                                    |
| 30:42      | Looking forward to talking to everybody in two weeks.                                    |
| 30:45      | Thank you.                                                                               |
