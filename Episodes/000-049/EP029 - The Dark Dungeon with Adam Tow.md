| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators. It is time for episode 29. David, how are you doing?                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 00:08      | Excellent, Rose. How are you today?                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 00:10      | I'm super excited because I got to meet this amazing person at the Automators meet up at [[WWDC]],                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 00:16      | and we looked at some really cool stuff together, and he agreed to come on the show. Do you know who it is?                                                                                                                                                    |
| 00:22      | Adam Tau, welcome to the show.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 00:24      | Hey, glad to be here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 00:26      | Yeah, Adam also was at the Automation Seminar. I know it was [[CMD-D Conference\|CMD-D]], right?                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 00:33      | Yeah, CMD-D.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 00:35      | And had this great photo workflow, but Adam, you've gone all the way in with Siri Shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 00:43      | I have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 00:44      | Well, tell us a little bit about your history with [[Apple]], Adam.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 00:47      | Man, my history with [[Apple]] goes way back. I've been using [[Apple]] products since the Apple II.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 00:54      | My parents bought an Apple II for our family, and I've been using [[Apple]] products ever since.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:00      | My first Mac was an SE30 back in 1989, and I transitioned to a PowerBook 180 for college, and it looked back.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:10      | That's amazing. I started with Macs a little bit later, but I remember seeing some of these and kind of,                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:15      | oh, they're nice. How was the PowerBook as a college machine? Was it portable? Was it automatable?                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:22      | Automatable? I don't know. Maybe with quick keys it was, but that was such a long time ago.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:27      | I don't really remember all the details, but yes, it was definitely portable.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:31      | The battery life was maybe like two hours long, so if you used every power saving option that you could,                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:40      | so it could get through like a half day of classes, and it had an active matrix screen, so it was actually very good in the sunlight.                                                                                                                          |
| 01:48      | Yes, something that we have a bit of problem with with today's iPads.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:52      | Yes, but it was only black and white, so it wasn't very colourful.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:57      | I can't help but feel that in the not too distant future, hopefully our lifetimes will look back at the five hour battery life                                                                                                                                 |
| 02:04      | and shake our head like, wow, I can't believe we only had five hours of battery life.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 02:08      | Yeah, laptops today, I mean, they tout their laptops to last all day long, but I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 02:14      | Maybe the same things that I'm doing, they only last like two, three hours still.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 02:18      | Yeah, it seems like different rules. The iPad and iPhone actually do last a long time where the laptops just don't.                                                                                                                                            |
| 02:25      | Though I will say, I can now at least charge my MacBook Air with something that looks like the charger that you get with an iPhone.                                                                                                                            |
| 02:33      | It's a little bit bigger, maybe it's closer to the size of the one that you get with a regular iPad, but I can charge it with a teeny tiny charger now.                                                                                                        |
| 02:40      | I'm still stuck with the 2015 MacBook Pro with [[MagSafe]] and the Huawei.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 02:46      | Well, you've always had an interest in automation, Adam.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 02:50      | And like I said, when we talked to [[CMD-D Conference\|CMD-D]] a few years ago, you had this really cool automation about photos, but you've gone further with it.                                                                                                               |
| 03:00      | Tell us a little bit about Message Filer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 03:02      | So Message Filer is a mail plugin for the Mac and it lets you file messages directly into mailboxes just by using the keyboard.                                                                                                                                |
| 03:10      | So if you have a lot of nested folders, a lot of mailboxes in mail, you can just type a few characters out of the mailbox, hit return, and the message will be filed automatically into that mailbox.                                                          |
| 03:20      | Yeah, and you've been able to keep, this is a mail plugin, right, for the mail app.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 03:24      | It's a little both. So when initially it started out as a mail plugin and mail plugins are kind of like a kind of like a unsupported feature within macOS 10 mail.                                                                                             |
| 03:34      | But when the Mac App Store came out in, what was it, Snow Leopard? Snow Leopard, yeah, Snow Leopard.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 03:41      | I decided to make a version of it for the Mac App Store and it's kind of a hybrid.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 03:46      | You can use it kind of standalone, but if you install a plugin, it works with the app to kind of supercharge filing.                                                                                                                                           |
| 03:55      | Are you ready? Are you getting ready for Catalina?                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 03:58      | I am. So the app actually hasn't been updated in a very long time.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 04:02      | What's great about having a plugin is that you can just update the plugin, which is separate from the Mac App Store.                                                                                                                                           |
| 04:07      | And you can have the Mac app kind of just stay there, but it stayed there for like several years.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 04:12      | So I'm working on an update that brings things like dark mode support, update some 32 bit compatibility things for Mojave and Catalina.                                                                                                                        |
| 04:21      | Mail plugin developers are having a bit of a struggle right now trying to get their plugins installed properly in Catalina.                                                                                                                                    |
| 04:28      | But we hope that's going to be those problems are going to be ironed out by the time, you know, it's released later this year.                                                                                                                                 |
| 04:35      | A few years ago at WWZ, I was talking from someone at [[Apple]] who told me point blank, he said that, you know, we consider the mail plugins like one of the last real security vulnerabilities on the Mac OS.                                                    |
| 04:49      | And, you know, for too long, it was very easy for anyone to create a plugin and potentially a malicious plugin.                                                                                                                                                |
| 04:57      | So they've really dialed it down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 04:59      | So my heart goes out to you guys, I know that people making good legitimate plugins that you can still do it.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 05:05      | But I understand it's quite a bit more work than it used to be.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 05:08      | You know, and the reason for that is from [[Apple|Apple's]] vantage point is what they want to protect security.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 05:13      | It definitely is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 05:14      | And every year I tell my customers like, why haven't you who asked me why haven't you updated message fire to support like, you know, AI powered, you know, intelligent, you know, show me the recommendations.                                                |
| 05:26      | Mailbox is the file too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 05:28      | And like, well, I don't know what's going to happen in the next version of the OS.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 05:32      | They may just like, get rid of plugins and turn macOS 10 mail into iOS mail.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 05:37      | So I do the bare minimum to support the product and really because the product is does exactly what I wanted to do.                                                                                                                                            |
| 05:45      | So a lot of the apps that I've written or even the shortcuts that we'll talk about later, they do exactly what I wanted to do.                                                                                                                                 |
| 05:51      | And, and I like them like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 05:54      | So if people are interested, head over to message filer.com MSG file.com.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 06:01      | And then so do you need the app at this point or can you do it just with the plugin?                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 06:05      | There's also a plugin that's available that you just can download and use its shareware.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 06:10      | So it will you can file messages and it will just nag you every every once in a while to purchase the product.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 06:17      | Okay, okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 06:18      | Well, well, I mean, that's one form of automation, but you do so much more at them.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 06:23      | So much more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 06:24      | Yeah, we can talk a little bit about my photography workflow because that's how we first met at the CMD-D conference.                                                                                                                                       |
| 06:30      | So how many of you use DSLR say are you only use your iPhones?                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 06:36      | I recently got a camera again, but I didn't get a DSLR.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 06:39      | I got a Canon point and shoot, but it's pretty nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 06:42      | And I mean, it's got 40 times optical zoom, which I have to say was the primary reason for getting it because the two times optical zoom in the iPhone doesn't quite cut it some of the time.                                                                  |
| 06:51      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 06:52      | And does this camera support Wi-Fi?                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 06:54      | Oh, yeah, it's got the whole works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 06:56      | It's even got a partner or companion application where you can record the location through your phone and then send it like it pairs it up with the photos afterwards, which is kind of cool.                                                                  |
| 07:06      | And how often do you use the Wi-Fi capability to send the photos from the camera to your phone?                                                                                                                                                                |
| 07:13      | I honestly have not yet plugged the camera in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 07:16      | I've only ever done it via the Wi-Fi.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 07:19      | That's what I was saying. So do you send pictures routinely from the camera to your phone via the Wi-Fi and the camera app?                                                                                                                                    |
| 07:26      | Yeah, I've never once even thought about taking the SD card out and plugging it into something.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 07:31      | I just open the app and grab the photos over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 07:34      | I found that it's kind of like a finicky process to get the Wi-Fi kind of working correctly where it's slow.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 07:41      | You have to open different apps and stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 07:43      | So what I wanted to accomplish with my DSLR was actually have the photos transfer automatically.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 07:49      | So I have a Canon 5D Mark IV and what's great about it is that it has the ability to contact FTP servers or regular FTP servers.                                                                                                                               |
| 07:58      | So I have it configured to send the photos once I click the shutter button, send the photos directly to my Mac mini that's running at home.                                                                                                                    |
| 08:06      | That's running a FTP S, which stands for secure FTP.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 08:10      | And then from there, I have a variety of scripts that send those photos to my [[Dropbox]] accounts, Google Photos accounts, Apple Photos, and even sends me the photos via iMessage.                                                                               |
| 08:22      | That is nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 08:24      | And then I also rename the files using a combination of [[Hazel]] and Exif Renamer.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 08:29      | Exif Renamer is a command line Pro script for reading and manipulating Exif data in photos.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 08:34      | And therefore the photos have the exact same file name as when I eventually import the raw files, which I archive into [[Amazon Prime Photos]].                                                                                                                    |
| 08:45      | So I can do like searches using my shortcut scripts to find the original raw photo and download it to my iPhone if I'm remote.                                                                                                                                 |
| 08:54      | That's really cool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 08:56      | So what actually prompted all of this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 08:58      | Because I mean, this is really cool, but I'm guessing there was a use case that inspired all of it.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 09:02      | Well, yeah, for the longest time, I shot with DSLRs and then the iPhone came out and I started shooting less and less with my big camera.                                                                                                                      |
| 09:12      | But as you know, the photos from the big camera oftentimes much better even today than the iPhone cameras.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 09:19      | So I started once the 5D Mark IV came out with FTP S.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 09:23      | I wanted to be able to have the same experience of shooting photos that I had with my iPhone camera with my DSLR.                                                                                                                                              |
| 09:32      | And now I do with this workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 09:34      | I can bring the big camera when I want to and I can get like super high quality images and they can be delivered straight to my iOS devices and all my [[Apple]] devices and cloud connected photo libraries.                                                      |
| 09:45      | How come you don't use like an IFI or one of those wireless memory cards?                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 09:50      | So a lot of DSLRs are made of metal and so these wireless cards don't have very good coverage when little SD cards contain a little kind of metal cage.                                                                                                        |
| 10:03      | And I did use IFI early on in the in the past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 10:08      | In fact, I actually helped design like the first IFI website when they first came out.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 10:13      | I know the founders of the company and so I used their products for a little bit, but the range wasn't very good.                                                                                                                                              |
| 10:19      | And the speeds were not always the best.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 10:22      | So in kind of like real world situations, it didn't work very well, I found.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 10:30      | Alright, so and just kind of walk us through the automation a bit.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 10:35      | Number one, so your camera has a Wi-Fi radio in it too.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 10:40      | I mean, how do you get it to the FTP to begin with?                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 10:43      | Yeah, so the Canon 5G Mark IV is one of the few cameras that actually supports FTP or FTPS transfers.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10:51      | There's a Sony camera and another kind of the higher end Canon cameras that support that.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 10:56      | And there's a built-in Wi-Fi chip, so I have it connected to a wireless hotspot that I carry with me all the time.                                                                                                                                             |
| 11:03      | I could use my iPhone, but that would drain the battery very quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 11:07      | So I have an Android device actually, which serves a mobile hotspot that can stay on pretty much indefinitely as long as it's being pinged.                                                                                                                    |
| 11:17      | I know on iOS, personal hotspot closes after a certain amount of inactivity.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 11:23      | So the camera is connected to the mobile hotspot.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 11:27      | And so when photos are taken, I send the small JPEG, you can shoot RAW or JPEG or RAW plus JPEG on the camera.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 11:34      | And I send the small JPEG, which is still an 8 megapixel image, to my FTPS server.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 11:41      | Small is relative these days on cameras.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 11:43      | Yeah, 8 megapixel, but it's still about 1 megabyte per image.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 11:47      | And I send that straight to the FTPS server that's running in my house.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11:52      | And from there, like I said before, I have a variety of [[Hazel]] scripts and Perl scripts that, reading the file, move the file to the right places, [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]] to import the file into my photos library.                                                    |
| 12:07      | So Apple Photos is running on the Mac mini, and there's an [[AppleScript]] that just imports the images.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 12:14      | And Adam has written a post about this, and we're going to link it in the show notes so you can go through and see exactly how he did it.                                                                                                                      |
| 12:21      | It's really clever and quite useful for anybody that's shooting on a non-iPhone.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 12:27      | One thing, did you solve the location problem with this? I don't see that you did, but maybe I'm missing something.                                                                                                                                            |
| 12:34      | The Canon 5D Mark IV does have a built-in GPS, so I could turn that on and get location information embedded into the photos, but I don't.                                                                                                                     |
| 12:45      | And the only reason is because it drains the battery even further.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 12:48      | So unfortunately, the Canon 5D Mark IV, when you have FTP wireless that has Bluetooth turned on, it drains the battery very quickly.                                                                                                                           |
| 12:57      | So I'm always carrying lots of extra batteries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 13:00      | And you don't want to carry four times as many for the GPS as well.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 13:04      | Exactly. I wish that the Canon supported charging through the USB port, but it doesn't do that yet.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 13:11      | That is one automation problem I haven't solved yet with, and that is when I use the fancy camera, getting location data.                                                                                                                                      |
| 13:19      | And the way I just manually add it in photos, in the photos application, and it's very generic.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 13:25      | I'm looking at your blog post, your Disney's California adventure.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 13:29      | So I would just set DCA, like the main gate as the location for those pictures.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 13:35      | I wouldn't have them set at the exact location in the park like I would with my iPhone.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 13:40      | But it just takes a few minutes to do it manually.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 13:43      | And every automation solution I've looked for, like sometimes you carry...                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 13:48      | One solution involves carrying a portable GPS logger with you and then syncing via timestamp the logger data with the photo data.                                                                                                                              |
| 13:58      | And there's just like two or three different ways to do it, but all of them seem to me like they're more trouble than they're worth.                                                                                                                           |
| 14:03      | I definitely feel the same way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 14:05      | That's one of the reasons why I've got the Canon that I do, because it specifically has this companion application where you can say,                                                                                                                          |
| 14:11      | start doing the GPS logging right now, and then stop, and then sync it with the photos afterwards, and then you're done.                                                                                                                                       |
| 14:17      | And because you don't do the GPS tracking on the camera, the camera doesn't run out of battery afterwards, you just sync it up afterwards.                                                                                                                     |
| 14:24      | I would assume your phone probably uses quite a bit of battery.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 14:27      | It does, but honestly, if I'm going somewhere where I really care about the GPS data on the pictures, I'm going to be carrying a battery pack or four.                                                                                                         |
| 14:34      | Depending on how big the batteries are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 14:37      | So I'm not too concerned about that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 14:40      | And it's not that bad because, I mean, your phone is tracking your location most of the time anyway for fine friends or, you know, maps, things like that.                                                                                                     |
| 14:48      | We have to look into that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 14:50      | There are some third-party apps that rather than having a GPS logger, you use your phone for it.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 14:55      | And then I've got a Sony camera, which I think actually has better support for this stuff than I'm actually giving it credit for.                                                                                                                              |
| 15:02      | I just haven't bothered to really get to the bottom of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 15:05      | Yeah, but no, this is really good as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 15:07      | I have one question for you, Adam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 15:09      | Is there a particular reason why you're using an [[AppleScript]] to import into photos rather than the built-in [[Hazel]] feature to add to a photos library?                                                                                                         |
| 15:16      | I did some tests, and the [[Hazel]] thing only operates, I think, on individual images, individual files.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 15:25      | So it was calling the import thing like over and over.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 15:28      | And so what I had done was I tried to kind of batch import, which kind of lessened the problem that you had with earlier versions of photos where you'd see last import and there's like one image.                                                            |
| 15:42      | So you'd have last import and like lots of images.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 15:45      | I'm still running kind of an older version of macOS.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 15:49      | I think maybe hide Sierra on the Mac mini since they removed some, it's running macOS 10 server, which had a kind of built-in [[VPN]].                                                                                                                             |
| 15:58      | And they kind of took that out of macOS 10 server in Mojave.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 16:03      | So I'm not sure exactly what I'm doing right now, but I think I'm still using kind of the batch import script.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 16:11      | This is really interesting for me because I have a Mac mini that's literally on its way to me right now, it should be arriving on Wednesday according to [[Apple|Apple's]] information.                                                                                  |
| 16:19      | And one of the things I really wanted to do is to set up actually like an automated photos thing where photos get properly imported and tagged and everything and put into my photos library because this is always a problem I've had.                        |
| 16:32      | My photos have never been vaguely organised, but now that photos has all these magic smart albums that it just does, I would really like to take advantage of this.                                                                                            |
| 16:40      | But if I don't have good photos, then well, I mean, there's a lot of screenshots of bugs and I was 13 that are currently populating my photos library.                                                                                                         |
| 16:47      | So that'll be my memories in 10 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 16:50      | Okay, so let me just put a pin in that to say, Rose, I've noted that you have bought a new Mac and we are going to talk about that in the future.                                                                                                              |
| 16:57      | Okay, okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 16:58      | Not right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 16:59      | Yeah, not right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 17:00      | Adam, what about the raw photos?                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 17:02      | Yeah, so when I get home, why import the raw photos into using photo mechanic and then that renames the files exactly how I renamed the images when they were sent via FTP.                                                                                    |
| 17:13      | And then I put them into, I used to use Apple Aperture, but obviously that went away.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 17:18      | So now I use Adobe Lightroom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 17:20      | And then I also have unfortunately, it's a manual process where I sync those photos to [[Amazon Prime Photos]].                                                                                                                                                    |
| 17:27      | And if you're a member, [[Amazon Prime]] member, you basically get unlimited photo storage.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 17:32      | And so I throw the raw images up there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 17:35      | Okay, a couple questions there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 17:37      | One is how does it get the exact name?                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 17:40      | So I use a kind of like a date stamp naming tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 17:45      | So basically the year, month, day and seconds and then the four digit frame number from the image.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 17:52      | And that kind of uniquely identifies the photos.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 17:56      | Yeah, and it's going to have the same date stamp as the JPEG.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 17:59      | So that makes sense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 18:00      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 18:01      | So then when you have the photo named the same way in Google, [[Dropbox]], [[Amazon Prime]] and iPhoto, you can do the same type of search across all the different photo services.                                                                                    |
| 18:12      | And some services are much better than others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 18:14      | So for instance, if I was looking for an image and I couldn't remember where it was taken, but I remember something that was in the image or a person that was in the image, I would go to Google Photos and do a quick search.                                |
| 18:25      | Google does all its AI recognition on stuff so I can look for like Roller Coaster and it'd find me the time that I went to Great America.                                                                                                                      |
| 18:34      | And then if I needed that raw image, I can go to [[Amazon Prime Photos]] and grab that image because I know the exact file name.                                                                                                                                   |
| 18:42      | That's a really smart way of doing it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 18:44      | I am totally stealing this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 18:46      | Stolen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 18:47      | Just consider it stolen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 18:48      | This is brilliant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 18:49      | And then what about like the initial edit, like if you're like me, you go out and take a bunch of pictures and quite often, you know, you really only need like one fourth or even less percentage of the actual pictures you took.                            |
| 19:03      | But your system is like importing and doing this stuff as you shoot them.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 19:08      | And you're making copies of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 19:11      | You're sticking them all over the place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 19:13      | Like when you decide to go through and edit the library, how do you do that?                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 19:18      | Yeah, that's that's always going to be a problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 19:21      | The way I see it is a storage is cheap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 19:24      | So you just don't delete.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 19:27      | When I'm doing like a final edit, if I'm going to distribute the photos to like I have I use smug mug.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 19:33      | I would I'll edit them in Lightroom and I'll post the final gallery, say just to smug mug, the final edited gallery.                                                                                                                                           |
| 19:43      | So I photo iCloud photo library obviously is is different on your iPhone.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 19:48      | You don't want to see all the images.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 19:49      | So I'm fine deleting the obviously bad images and then they'll disappear from all my iCloud connected devices.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 19:57      | And then also how you said something earlier that once you send the JPEG to the Mac mini, I believe you said it messages you a copy of the picture.                                                                                                            |
| 20:08      | You said you get like one remotely immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 20:11      | So sometimes the the sync to iCloud photo library takes a long time.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 20:16      | Yeah, who knows what's happening with an iCloud when you send it.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 20:20      | There's so many different involvements like if you're at a public place and you don't have good Wi-Fi, it's first it's got to get up on the Internet at home and then it's got to get back to your device.                                                     |
| 20:29      | It does take a while.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 20:30      | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 20:31      | But what I found was if you send yourself an iMessage, it comes pretty pretty quickly.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 20:35      | So I have an [[AppleScript]] that basically I messages the messages app on the Mac is open on the Mac mini server is open and signed into to my account.                                                                                                          |
| 20:45      | And so I just send myself the image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 20:48      | So I have an [[AppleScript]] that sends the image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 20:51      | I actually I think I resize the image so it's a little smaller.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 20:54      | And I just sent send myself the image so it comes pretty quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 20:57      | So the problem there then is that if you have an [[Apple Watch]], which I do, the [[Apple Watch]] is constantly getting pinged with messages.                                                                                                                          |
| 21:05      | And I found that that actually drains the [[Apple Watch]] battery very quickly if you're constantly getting messages, even if you've turned off notification for that iMessage account.                                                                            |
| 21:15      | Oh, that's annoying because I know in the messages app you can I've just I've just done to David.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 21:20      | I've now hidden alerts on the message side that I share with David.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 21:23      | And now I just shown the alerts as well, but does that not transfer to the [[Apple Watch]]?                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 21:27      | I got the impression previously that it did, but maybe some of these centres are also landing in unknown centres.                                                                                                                                              |
| 21:32      | You can mute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 21:33      | Yeah, you can mute the notification, but this the message still comes in.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 21:36      | So, so for instance, yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 21:38      | So for instance, if you're doing an all night, all day shoot, and you're connected to this, you're sending like hundreds, thousands of photos through through the network onto your [[Apple Watch]], your iOS device.                                              |
| 21:52      | And that I found that eventually the [[Apple Watch]] eventually pings me and says low battery.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 21:57      | I wonder if that's because it's images that are getting sent through or just messages.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 22:02      | I mean, as an experiment, and be curious to see if you didn't attach the messages, the images, but just got a message each time.                                                                                                                               |
| 22:10      | It may be the data transfer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 22:13      | I suspect the photos are playing a part because if you think about it, if you open messages on the watch, then you can actually like browse through and                                                                                                        |
| 22:21      | see the exact message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 22:23      | And I'm trying to look for something where I've sent somebody a photo recently.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 22:26      | And I apparently just don't send people pictures via iMessage because there is nothing here.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 22:31      | But you can see the pictures usually when people send me something.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 22:35      | It comes through on my [[Apple Watch]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 22:37      | Oh, there we go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 22:38      | I sent my mom a picture of the TV and it's right here, even though I've never looked at it before on my watch.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 22:42      | So, yeah, I suspect it's trying to save it there.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 22:46      | Wow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 22:47      | Well, that's quite a workflow, Adam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 22:49      | You shared this one at [[CMD-D Conference\|CMD-D]] and I'm like, man, this is crazy, but it's kind of awesome too, you know, because it really covers a lot of problems.                                                                                                         |
| 22:58      | It gets you immediate feedback on your photos, gives you something you can send to social media from your DSLR with no work.                                                                                                                                   |
| 23:06      | It gets multiple copies stored to the cloud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 23:09      | So if your camera, you know, falls off the tram, you're still going to have captured all your pictures for the day.                                                                                                                                            |
| 23:15      | Just, you know, it solves a lot of problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 23:17      | It does, and this actually segues nicely into how I use the photography workflow with shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 23:23      | Ooh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 23:24      | Well, before we get to that one, I think it would be a good moment to stop and thank our sponsors and then come back to shortcuts.                                                                                                                             |
| 23:31      | It is time to thank today's sponsor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 24:02      | I first discovered TextExpander about seven years ago,                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 24:06      | and some of the snippets that I use most frequently include things like my name and email address,                                                                                                                                                             |
| 24:12      | as well as a specific signature that I have to use with outside contacts at work.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 24:16      | I'll recommend TextExpander to anybody who types the same thing again and again,                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 24:21      | or similar things that you could use the fancy snippets with fill-in fields to help customise.                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 24:48      | Our thanks to TextExpander from Smile for their support of this show and Relay FM.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 24:53      | Okay, Adam, so you were just telling us about, you know, you've got all of this camera workflow,                                                                                                                                                               |
| 24:58      | but now you have a bunch of things that you can do in shortcuts with it as well.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 25:01      | What is that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 25:02      | That's right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 25:03      | So when I'm going about shooting and I wanted to distribute my photos to a particular group of people,                                                                                                                                                         |
| 25:09      | I would create a [[Dropbox]] folder and then tell the camera to send all the photos to that [[Dropbox]] folder,                                                                                                                                                        |
| 25:17      | in addition to, you know, my photos library, Google Photos [[Dropbox]].                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 25:23      | So I have a shortcut.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 25:24      | It actually started out as a workflow action called PB5D.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 25:30      | So it's kind of like Photo Bot 5D, kind of like a play on R2D2.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 25:34      | PB5D [[Dropbox]] destination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 25:36      | And so I run the workflow or the shortcut and it asks me, you know, what [[Dropbox]] folder you want to send this to.                                                                                                                                              |
| 25:42      | And I can also optionally create a new [[Dropbox]] folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 25:45      | And I type in the name or I select one pre, that's already pre-filled.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 25:50      | And from that point on, the photos are also copied to this [[Dropbox]] folder,                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 25:55      | which I can then share with, you know, other people.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 25:58      | That's pretty nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 26:00      | So how do you do the folders?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 26:03      | Because I'm guessing if you're sharing a whole folder with somebody,                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 26:05      | you probably don't want the photos from six weeks ago in there.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 26:08      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 26:09      | So you can also say none so that you can basically effectively turn off the [[Dropbox]] destination feature of this workflow.                                                                                                                                      |
| 26:17      | So if I'm doing a shoot, so a few at [[WWDC]], James Dempsey and The Breakpoints were doing a concert.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 26:23      | And so I created a [[Dropbox]] folder and basically all the images were being sent to this folder.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 26:30      | And then James had a friend, Victor, who is backstage, who is looking at all the images and posting them to social media in real time.                                                                                                                         |
| 26:38      | So I didn't have to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 26:39      | That's how that was working.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 26:40      | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 26:41      | Oh, the curtain has been lifted on all the secrets.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 26:44      | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 26:45      | So I wasn't the one that was actually looking at the images and say, oh, that's a good one to post to Twitter.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 26:49      | Here it goes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 26:50      | We had someone in the back that was handling all of that.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 26:53      | And that was made possible using this wireless photography workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 26:58      | That is really nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 27:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 27:01      | So another example is that you're at a birthday party or wedding and you just want to share the photos immediately.                                                                                                                                            |
| 27:06      | You know, you don't care too much about editing.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 27:08      | You can just run the shortcut [[Dropbox]] destination, say, you know, Alan and Jen's wedding and then share that [[Dropbox]] folder instead of here.                                                                                                                   |
| 27:18      | Here are my photos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 27:19      | You know, and anyone can look at them, anyone can see them, anyone can download them.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 27:24      | That's really nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 27:25      | And because you can create the folder in advance and you could also create a QR code, which basically just links to that folder or a short link or something on cards and have them given to the guests as well so that everyone can just download the photos. |
| 27:36      | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 27:37      | Now, I wouldn't do that if you're the official wedding photographer since they will see everything, including the bad images.                                                                                                                                  |
| 27:43      | But if you're just there as a guest, it's an easy way to get the photos to the couple without having to go through any kind of photo sharing service.                                                                                                          |
| 27:52      | That's nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 27:53      | And then you've, of course, got the pictures of the person who drank just a little bit too much who's doing air guitar on stage.                                                                                                                               |
| 27:59      | So, you know, you've got those photos forever and so does everyone else in case you ever need to blackmail them.                                                                                                                                               |
| 28:04      | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 28:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 28:06      | There used to be a time where they put these box cameras on every table at a wedding.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 28:10      | Oh, yeah, the disposable cameras.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 28:13      | Yeah, my wife and I used to have a lot of fun with those and we would always, you know, take some interesting pictures just to see what the bride and groom would say.                                                                                                |
| 28:21      | Sometimes they'd say nothing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 28:23      | Those were the best.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 28:24      | But to tell me, if you're setting up this [[Dropbox]] folder, do you do it?                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 28:30      | Okay, I'm sure you've done it in the past, like where you're like, I'm going to the wedding tomorrow.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 28:34      | I'm going to create everything here on my Mac before I leave so it's all ready to go.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 28:38      | But on occasion, you would probably want to do that remotely.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 28:42      | Are you able to do that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 28:44      | I haven't thought about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 28:45      | I guess you'd use the [[Dropbox]] app on your phone to create the folder.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 28:48      | Not at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 28:49      | You can use shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 28:50      | So, shortcut says the action create folder and yeah, I can create a folder in iCloud or in [[Dropbox]].                                                                                                                                                            |
| 28:57      | So, the shortcut itself [[Dropbox]] destination creates the folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 29:01      | But what about throwing the sharing flag on that folder?                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 29:03      | Can you do that through shortcuts?                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 29:05      | That, I don't think you can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 29:07      | So, that I would just open up the [[Dropbox]] folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 29:10      | I think you can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 29:11      | Really?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 29:12      | Because it shortcuts has an action where you can get a link to a file.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 29:17      | And if you give it a folder, then at least on iOS 12, this used to work.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 29:23      | And I know because that's how I would get links to folders for guest posts that I wrote.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 29:29      | So, I recently did, for example, a guest post on the Relay FM newsletter sharing everybody my desk.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 29:34      | And the way I got the link to that was actually, I have a guest post folder and I have a shortcut                                                                                                                                                              |
| 29:39      | that lets me get a link to that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 29:40      | So, I will try and put that in show notes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 29:43      | But what I'm talking about is like, if you're at the wedding, you say, I want to share this with somebody.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 29:48      | Can I do that outside of the [[Dropbox]] app?                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 29:52      | Could I have shortcuts turn it into a shared folder just via the shortcut?                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 29:57      | I'm going to play with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 29:58      | I don't think that's possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 29:59      | No, but you can get the link.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 30:01      | And then I guess you could, I don't have it open in front of me right now, but I think the [[Dropbox]] app,                                                                                                                                                        |
| 30:07      | the iOS app would allow you to turn that flag on and that would be close enough.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 30:11      | I'm just curious, because this is a great workflow, very easy to implement for anybody.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 30:16      | And this could also not necessarily even work with your big fancy camera, but your iPhone camera,                                                                                                                                                              |
| 30:21      | just moving the images over to [[Dropbox]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 30:24      | So, the sharing option is kind of nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 30:27      | And then another thing I was thinking about, it'd be fun to expand that as a shareable shortcut for people,                                                                                                                                                    |
| 30:33      | where if you're at a wedding, you could pass the shortcut around.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 30:39      | And folks could also be uploading their images.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 30:42      | So, you'd have a, you know, in essence a group library.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 30:45      | That is a nice way to do it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 30:47      | Yeah, [[Dropbox]] does have that submit files feature.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 30:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 30:51      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 30:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 30:53      | Well, you can just let people drop stuff in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 30:55      | But the trick is getting it with people who are not tech savvy.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 30:58      | That's why I like the idea of a shortcut where it just gets them a memo.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 31:02      | They aim in you and they just push a button.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 31:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 31:05      | Yeah, but then what do you do with people on Android?                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 31:07      | Is there a Tasker action for this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 31:09      | Too bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 31:10      | Maybe?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 31:11      | Too bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 31:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 31:14      | Send them to me by MMS and I'll figure something out.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 31:17      | Adam, you do a lot with shortcuts and we're going to put some links to some of the stuff you've done.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 31:22      | In fact, everybody just make a note tow.com, T-O-W dot com.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 31:29      | That's Adam's website and there's tons of automation stuff showing up in there.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 31:33      | Like for instance, there's just so much great shortcut stuff, but there's lots of automation.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 31:37      | And, but the, the one that you've done that nobody else has done.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 31:42      | The one that, one of the reasons, honestly, you're on the show is you created a chooser                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 31:47      | on adventure, you know, basically text adventure with shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 31:52      | Adam, that's awesome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 31:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 31:55      | So I created this kind of advanced dialogue engine for shortcuts called Prompt Kit.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 32:03      | And kind of the idea behind it was to kind of supercharge the alerts and prompts in iOS                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 32:14      | to support kind of translations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 32:18      | And kind of working around on it, I decided, hey, this is actually work for kind of choose                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 32:24      | your own adventure type things where you can create basically an interactive story in text                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 32:31      | and run it through this dialogue engine Prompt Kit.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 32:34      | And then it would prompt the user, ask them questions and they could respond.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 32:40      | Based on their response, you could dynamically send them to another prompt and another prompt,                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 32:45      | another prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 32:46      | And so that's kind of how Prompt Kit started.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 32:49      | And then I created a prototype of a chooser on adventure type story called Dark Dungeon,                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 32:53      | which I'll be releasing shortly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 32:55      | That's awesome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 32:56      | This is really nice because that is something that I wouldn't say it's impossible to do                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 33:01      | in shortcuts because it isn't, but doing what is essentially a switch case where you say,                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 33:07      | okay, if person chooses option A, go over here and do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 33:10      | If person chooses option B, go over here and do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 33:12      | Well, that's, you know, if A, but then you have to start adding an if B inside of it.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 33:17      | And at some point you've got a 12.9 inch iPad screen and then you're working with something                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 33:21      | that's the width of an iPhone just because of the way that shortcuts nest things.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 33:25      | So you've done a lot of the hard work and handled this, which is impressive.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 33:29      | Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 33:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 33:31      | So you're welcome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 33:32      | So yeah, exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 33:33      | You can do a chooser on adventure thing in shortcuts, but it will get complicated very, very quickly.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 33:38      | So what I did was I kind of separated the kind of the logic out of the nested actions into                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 33:45      | what's effectively a JSON file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 33:47      | So a text file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 33:48      | So you can actually write these things in a text editor and then copy and paste that code                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 33:54      | into a shortcut that then calls prompt kit and then just runs your story.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 33:59      | And I really appreciate this because as a guy who used to have an [[Apple]] too, you go back                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 34:04      | far enough that you remember when we all learned basic on our [[Apple]] or Tandy or whatever                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 34:10      | computer it was back in the day, the first game that we all made was a text adventure                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 34:15      | because that is something you could do with basic.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 34:19      | I have fond memories playing games like sword thrust.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 34:22      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 34:25      | Zork was the big one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 34:26      | I remember in my English class, my English teacher essentially gave this to us as a prompt                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 34:32      | writing story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 34:33      | So we were there with dice trying to choose answers and things like that.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 34:36      | And then we actually had to write a full on story based on the adventure that we just                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 34:40      | done, which was really fun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 34:42      | And the other feature of prompt is it does real time translation.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 34:46      | So if you get delivered a prompt kit story that's written in English, but you use the                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 35:05      | Yeah, that is very nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 35:17      | It does use the Microsoft translate text action that's part of shortcuts to do the machine                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 35:22      | translation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 35:23      | Yes, which I mean, I have to say being translation is not bad as far as automated translation                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 35:28      | goes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 35:29      | It's pretty good, but there will occasionally probably be a little bit of weirdness there,                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 35:33      | but I think we can forgive that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 35:35      | I know, but it's so amazing when you think about it that you can just take a bunch of                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 35:38      | text and just translate it to Japanese, I mean, a language so different from English.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 35:43      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 35:44      | And it's pretty far along the way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 35:47      | I'm sure it's not complete, but it's pretty far along in terms of getting you what you                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 35:51      | need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 35:52      | So you used one of your, I'm going to call it a kit shortcut for this, so essentially                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 35:58      | a framework called PromptKit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 36:00      | But this is not the only framework that you've created for shortcuts that other shortcut                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 36:05      | creators can use in their applications, is it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 36:07      | It isn't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 36:08      | Yeah, I created a framework called app framework, which a lot of my shortcuts, my complicated                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 36:13      | shortcuts are based on, which brings kind of like global variables, functions, other                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 36:20      | helper functions to basically create kind of interactive shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 36:25      | So explain that for folks who are not programmers.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 36:28      | A lot of people listen to the show like automation, but don't have X code installed.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 36:34      | Right, right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 36:35      | So shortcuts, you know, if you think about it, they're kind of like quick macros.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 36:39      | You get some input and you do something on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 36:42      | So what I wanted to see what was possible is could you create full on applications within                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 36:47      | shortcuts, using shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 36:50      | And there was no kind of easy way to do that unless you did some shortcut magic, I would                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 36:58      | say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 36:59      | So I created this kind of this application loop that, you know, the shortcut, when you                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 37:04      | launch a shortcut, it starts this continuous loop that runs forever until you quit the                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 37:09      | shortcut.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 37:10      | And it displays menus, so you can have options just like when you run an app, you have what                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 37:16      | you want to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 37:17      | And it gives you a bunch of menu with a variety of options.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 37:20      | And then you run that option, it does its execution, and then it returns to the application                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 37:24      | loop and shows you the menu again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 37:28      | So using this framework, you can basically create a full on shortcut applications within                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 37:33      | the shortcut framework.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 37:36      | That's impressive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 37:37      | So you end up being able to do, well, maybe not everything, but almost anything, I presume,                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 37:43      | at least within the realms of what's possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 37:45      | Within the realm of what's possible within shortcuts, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 37:49      | But this approach actually allowed me to create kind of some things that weren't even possible                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 37:55      | even within a stock iOS app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 37:58      | So one of the shortcuts I developed was called Cronios, which was a way to run shortcuts                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 38:04      | automatically in the background in iOS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 38:07      | So you see today with iOS 13, you know, they have the ability to run shortcuts automatically                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 38:14      | based on like time and location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 38:16      | But Cronios on iOS 12 was a viable way to kind of run these before.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 38:23      | Before, exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 38:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 38:25      | And you're saying iOS 12, I'm guessing, unfortunately, that means iOS 13 has broken something?                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 38:31      | iOS 13 has definitely broken a few things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 38:34      | It's brought a few things to the table, very exciting things to the table, but for a lot                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 38:39      | of my shortcuts, it's kind of made them either obsolete or broken.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 38:44      | So I'm still working on trying to get them updated for iOS 13, but the current betas                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 38:49      | are a little buggy at the moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 38:50      | So I'm hopeful that they'll be, things will stabilise soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 38:54      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 38:56      | When Adam says things are a little bit buggy, I literally picked up my iPad today and opened                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 39:01      | it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 39:02      | Sorry, I turned it on because I'd had to turn it off yesterday evening because there was                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 39:05      | something that just kept crashing in the background.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 39:07      | I was like, okay, iOS back, turn it off, leave it overnight, come back to it in the morning.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 39:10      | I turned it on and I unlocked it and it told me settings crashed in the background.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 39:15      | It's like, excuse me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 39:16      | Yeah, that's a new one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 39:17      | I literally just turned this off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 39:19      | So yes, I failed a radar on that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 39:21      | It's just, you know, I think this year is one where they made a lot of forward progress                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 39:26      | and that always comes with bugs, you know, and I'm okay with that so long as they can                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 39:32      | get them ironed out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 39:33      | And like even like in shortcuts, you talked about the crone-based triggers, you know,                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 39:38      | the time-based triggers, those weren't working for me until beta four.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 39:42      | I mean, it just-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 39:43      | Yeah, but then beta four broke NFC tag support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 39:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 39:46      | Just for fun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 39:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 39:48      | So, but they got, you know, they're making progress, I guess is what I'd say.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 39:53      | But you know, we're now getting closer to September.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 39:56      | So hopefully they do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 39:58      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 39:59      | And I have to say, I mean, it's, in some ways, it's a shame that all of the work that you've                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 40:02      | put into this, Adam, is being, you know, sure-locked.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 40:06      | But on the other hand, it may have just, it may have also been a proof of concept, you                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 40:10      | know, you created this stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 40:12      | And so the shortcuts team are there going to [[Apple]] going, look at what people are making                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 40:15      | so that they can do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 40:16      | Can we please implement it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 40:18      | Please, please, please.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 40:20      | And somebody at [[Apple]] was like, I'll go on then.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 40:22      | So maybe you were the canary in the coal mine, unwitting canary paths.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 40:27      | And fairly, I mean, a couple of points there is number one is now it's a lot more accessible                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 40:31      | to folks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 40:32      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 40:33      | You know, it's much easier to do the way they've set it up than, but also there are                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 40:38      | things that Adam's done that still aren't there.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 40:40      | Like you have that notes based protocol where you make an Apple note and then all of a sudden                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 40:47      | it starts doing things in the background with shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 40:50      | To explain that one a little, I think it was a note cuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 40:52      | It's called note cuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 40:53      | So what note cuts does is it triggers the automatic running of shortcuts based on new                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 40:57      | texts that's been added to an Apple note, a [[Dropbox]] text file or an Evernote note.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 41:03      | So this allows you to integrate with services like if this than that or Zapier.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 41:07      | So based on some type of web trigger, you could then have those if this than that or                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 41:12      | Zapier add some text to like [[Dropbox]] or Evernote.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 41:16      | And then when note cuts runs, it says, hey, there's a new, there's a new piece of text                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 41:21      | and it says run the shortcut and or run the shortcut automatically on the device.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 41:26      | So you could actually share these notes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 41:28      | So if I shared a note with you Rosemary and I said, you know, speak text, hey, this is                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 41:34      | your iPhone speaking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 41:35      | If you're writing note codes, note cuts, it would like speak that and you're like, what                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 41:39      | just happened?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 41:40      | Why is my iPhone talking to me?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 41:42      | Yeah, I would then be convinced that my iPhone is possessed and run away screaming and then                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 41:46      | come back and restore it to iOS 12.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 41:48      | Perhaps probably wouldn't actually resolve my problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 41:50      | But there we go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 41:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 41:52      | But you could see how it could be used if for less nefarious purposes, if you wanted                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 41:55      | to notify someone that, hey, I'm leaving this place and they weren't using find my friends,                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 42:01      | you could do that or you could run like shortcuts remotely for family members who aren't is,                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 42:07      | you know, tech savvy, tech savvy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 42:09      | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 42:10      | But then I'm guessing [[Apple]] will never enable a feature like that.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 42:15      | Well, note cuts does work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 42:18      | The underlying concept still works on iOS 13.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 42:21      | So assuming I can get the shortcut working without any problems, we'll still be able                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 42:29      | But can it also detect if you run the shortcut after the note has been modified or is it just                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 42:40      | You could add a piece of text that says I ran and then another note cut on the other                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 42:46      | device could run and say, oh, you saw this or you ran this.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 42:50      | So it's definitely, definitely possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 42:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 42:53      | Or you could delete the text that actually triggers the action that would also be a possibility.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 42:58      | I'm wondering about ways to modify this for my own ends.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 43:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 43:08      | He doesn't use it a lot, but it's usually sitting in there and I've just moved some                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 43:11      | plugs around today so it can basically sit there on charge all the time.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 43:14      | So I may start freaking him out with some of this stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 43:17      | See, see, Rose, you're already going to the dark place with this stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 43:20      | I see you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 43:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 43:22      | But that's not the only, Adam, I guess there's some other problems with iOS 13 shortcuts                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 43:28      | for the kind of stuff you're doing with runtime.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 43:32      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 43:33      | So the shortcut team has made a lot of changes to how you create shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 43:38      | The actions now look very much like natural language, like you're reading a sentence.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 43:44      | And they've changed the way inputs are done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 43:46      | So inputs to shortcuts are now in the actions themselves as opposed to before.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 43:50      | It was whatever the previous action was that was the input for the next action.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 43:55      | And I think it might be good, this approach might be good for new shortcut developers,                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 44:03      | but for kind of old curmudgeonly people like myself, it's kind of annoying, I think.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 44:10      | Because now I feel like I have to read the shortcut in order to understand what's happening,                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 44:16      | like read each action, see, this is the input, and then this is what's going to happen as                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 44:21      | opposed to just looking at the action, seeing what's above it, and then seeing all the options                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 44:25      | for the shortcut all listed out, not hidden behind a show more button.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 44:29      | Which automatically collapses as well, even if there's something in it, which has led                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 44:33      | me several times to thinking that my shortcuts are broken.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 44:36      | Because previously, if you expanded the show more on, say, get contents of URL to do something,                                                                                                                                                                |
| 44:41      | then that would just stay expanded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 44:43      | And now it automatically collapses, which makes me occasionally think that shortcuts                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 44:45      | has forgotten that I expanded it and done things.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 44:49      | And then it turns out there's another bug in there, like I typed field instead of fields                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 44:52      | when doing something with error table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 44:53      | Well, I can see how this definitely is a problem for the type of stuff Adam is doing.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 44:59      | And that's no fun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 45:00      | But at the same time, from the flip side, I think there's lots of folks out there that                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 45:05      | will actually be able to use shortcuts now that weren't before.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 45:08      | So it's like, there's a trade-off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 45:11      | I don't think it was malicious, like they weren't trying to shut folks like Adam down                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 45:15      | as much as I think they're really trying to make it way more accessible to everyone.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 45:20      | I agree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 45:21      | Yes, something tells me that the Shortcuts team were sitting there going, hmm, how can                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 45:24      | we mess with Adam Tau this year?                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 45:28      | I think they had a little too much on their plate to even think about that.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 45:31      | But yeah, I mean, it does read more like [[AppleScript]] now than programming stuff, which is not necessarily                                                                                                                                                      |
| 45:37      | a bad thing, but it's definitely a change which requires you to perhaps not completely                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 45:42      | relearn how to use the application, but it is a learning curve for everybody.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 45:47      | But even with the improvements they've made and the additional triggers we have, I feel                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 45:51      | like there's still space for the stuff Adam is doing because there is going to be a limit                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 45:55      | to how far [[Apple]] is going to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 45:58      | You're doing some really advanced stuff here, and I hope it continues, I guess is what I'd                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 46:05      | say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 46:06      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 46:07      | I do too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 46:08      | And I think the bugs that we're seeing in Shortcuts hopefully are bugs that are going                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 46:11      | to be resolved, so things like not being able to choose whatever the previous input                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 46:20      | was as the input to the action, instead of having to, if you set an input and then you                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 46:26      | happen to delete that input later, you have to reset what that input was in the action.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 46:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 46:32      | Instead of it automatically falling back to the previous one, which it sometimes does                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 46:35      | and sometimes doesn't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 46:36      | I think that's also a beta thing, and occasionally it seems to be where I've manually set the                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 46:40      | input to a Shortcut to something, which is the previous item, then it also doesn't figure                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 46:46      | it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 46:47      | But yeah, the new sentencing has also created some problems for me.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 46:52      | I'm having to do a lot of get X from input before I do an if now, because while it might                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 46:57      | be a text box, it is a number, and I want the if greater than option that Shortcuts                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 47:02      | is there going, if it contains, well, if it contains a six, it could be 6, 16, 60, 666.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 47:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 47:08      | It could be anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 47:09      | I just want to know if it's more or less than six.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 47:12      | Yeah, it's like with that push for simplicity, we do bump into some problems that occur,                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 47:21      | and hopefully, we're still in beta, so I don't want to be too...                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 47:25      | Oh, no.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 47:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 47:27      | But if we get to September and some of these problems still exist, you're going to hear                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 47:28      | about it because they do need to get changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 47:31      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 47:32      | As a reminder, for everybody listening who's running public or developer beta, whenever                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 47:35      | something does not work, please, please, please file feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 47:39      | Feedback is your friend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 47:40      | And also, something doesn't work the way you think it should, or it doesn't work the way                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 47:43      | you expect it to, file feedback because the Shortcuts team wants feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 47:49      | They are probably doing the surprise Pikachu face at the amount of feedbacks that they're                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 47:56      | Well, and they've made it easier than ever whether you're on the developer or the public                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 48:01      | I was just talking about this on the Mac Power Users.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 48:03      | Now, you can actually attach a video file, and since you can record your screen very                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 48:08      | easily on iOS, there's really no excuse not to turn this stuff in.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 48:12      | I mean, you can really give them a great explanation just with a video file, and I hope everybody's                                                                                                                                                            |

| 48:19      | If you don't put the beta on, take the time to submit the feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 48:22      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 48:23      | And as a note, if the bug doesn't happen when you're recording a video, that's probably                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 48:27      | because the video recording is using just enough process or power that slows everything                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 48:30      | down and fixes a race condition, so tell them that.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 48:35      | Sounds like the voice of experience Rose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 48:37      | Yes, I spent quite some time digging around, trying to figure out why something worked                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 48:43      | when it was being recorded, but didn't work the rest of the time, and was talking to some                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 48:48      | of the people at [[Apple]] about it, and then they realised that it was just using just                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 48:52      | enough processor space that it was slowing something down and fixing a race condition.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 48:56      | So at least that's what they told me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 48:57      | I don't know if that's actually true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 48:59      | I've never not seen the code myself, of course, but I can believe it.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 49:02      | It seems very plausible, so yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 49:05      | I can see a feedback from Adam just saying, you guys just need to put prompt kit in shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 49:11      | It just needs to become an action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 49:13      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 49:24      | Well, anyway, Adam, I continue to be impressed with all the great stuff you create.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 49:29      | I love the way you use automation to solve so many problems in your life, but I also                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 49:33      | love the way you share all this great stuff with shortcuts you're doing.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 49:37      | You really are at the sharp end of the stick in terms of making shortcuts into more than                                                                                                                                                                       |
