| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 00:00      | Hello and welcome to Automators. My name is Rosemary Orchard and I am joined by my co-host              |
| 00:07      | David Sparks and we're here to talk about how to get your technology to do your work                    |
| 00:11      | for you. Hello, David.                                                                                  |
| 00:13      | Hello, Rosemary. You ready to automate today?                                                           |
| 00:16      | Oh, yes. And we're going to do one of my favourite topics today because there's just                     |
| 00:21      | something about task management and specifically capture and review that really, really makes           |
| 00:26      | me happy when it comes to automation. Maybe it's because it's kind of like having my                    |
| 00:31      | automation do my tasks for me, but it certainly feels like it's saving my day.                          |
| 00:35      | It's also dangerous. I feel like too much capture in task management means you add                      |
| 00:39      | too much to your task management and then you've got, you know, thousands of tasks.                     |
| 00:43      | So you got to walk the line, but it is it is definitely tedious adding tasks and we even                |
| 00:50      | have some cool automation on review as well. So bringing automation to bear on this stuff               |
| 00:56      | is absolutely useful and something that everybody should do. So I guess we should just get started.     |
| 01:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:04      | Oh, we can't get started yet, Rosemary.                                                                 |
| 01:06      | Oh.                                                                                                     |
| 01:07      | It's Valentine's Day. Happy Valentine's, everybody.                                                     |
| 01:10      | Yes. And happy birthday to my grandmother who's probably not listening to this episode,                 |
| 01:14      | but it's her birthday and her name's Valerie and she was born on Valentine's Day.                       |
| 01:17      | Is there love in the air? I hope so.                                                                    |
| 01:20      | Probably.                                                                                               |
| 01:21      | I hope so. I asked that once in a deposition. There was a case we had where it was a car                |
| 01:26      | accident on Valentine's night and I asked if there was love in the air and the the judge                |
| 01:31      | thought that was silly. He didn't think I should do that, but yeah, I got, I got to                     |
| 01:35      | be me.                                                                                                  |
| 01:36      | You live and you learn.                                                                                 |
| 01:37      | I got to be me.                                                                                         |
| 01:38      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                          |
| 01:39      | Automated capture. So, so task management, like we were saying, is something that everybody             |
| 01:43      | struggles with. You want to make sure you get that stuff out of your head, out of your                  |
| 01:49      | brain, into your system, but it can be tedious to put it in, especially with applications               |
| 01:54      | that require additional metadata, you know, the best ones to do because the more metadata               |
| 01:59      | you can add to that task, the easier it is to sort it and find it and organise it later.                |
| 02:03      | But who wants to do that over and over again?                                                           |
| 02:06      | Oh yeah, definitely not me. I, I hate duplicating my work. So I'm always trying to simplify             |
| 02:12      | that.                                                                                                   |
| 02:13      | Yeah. We're going to have probably a lot of emphasis on OmniFocus because both of us                    |
| 02:18      | use it. I mean, we both published, you know, books and video courses on it. So that's                   |
| 02:22      | something that we talk a lot about, but I'd like to think that we're also going to try                  |
| 02:25      | and make this apply to other task managers as well.                                                     |
| 02:29      | Just to start off, one of the easiest ways to automate task capture for me with OmniFocus               |
| 02:33      | is you can create template actions in OmniFocus and you can fill in all that metadata. So               |
| 02:42      | like a good example is often I will be wandering around my day and I'll have a sudden, you              |
| 02:48      | know, lightning Hallelujah moment about something I want to post at the website. Well, I have           |
| 02:53      | a short, a shortcut that I built that's very easy. It's a one step shortcut because the                 |
| 02:59      | OmniFocus new task shortcut on iOS lets you fill in the tags, the project, the due date,                |
| 03:06      | the flag status.                                                                                        |
| 03:07      | So I filled in all of that stuff for creating a new task. And all I do is I tap the button              |
| 03:13      | for new blog post and I type in the name of the blog post. In fact, the entry says write                |
| 03:20      | blog post about so it even writes the first three words of the task. And then all I do                  |
| 03:26      | is type in, you know, whatever, you know, you know, iPhone pairing or, you know, whatever.              |
| 03:31      | And then I hit the button and it gets added to my task system with all the necessary flags,             |
| 03:38      | projects, project names and everything without me having to do that. And I have made like               |
| 03:43      | seven or eight of those, I mean, related to different parts of the law practice and the                 |
| 03:47      | podcast, like podcasting is another one, I have one for ideas for shows. And I have                     |
| 03:52      | one for each of my three podcasts. So you just take a few minutes to set that up once.                  |
| 03:58      | And then you can put that through shortcuts, you can put it on a button, you can put it                 |
| 04:02      | on your home screen, you can do whatever you want with it to get to it quickly. But that's              |
| 04:06      | a simple automation, but one very useful. Yeah, I have something very similar where                     |
| 04:11      | I capture all of my ideas for the suite setup. And so it starts with an ask for input, and              |
| 04:16      | then it splits the text, the input by lines. So that each line is theoretically a task.                 |
| 04:24      | So if I come up with six ideas and I capture them all at the same time, then it works really            |
| 04:28      | easily. And then for each one of those for a second. Yeah. Alright, so you're capturing                 |
| 04:34      | text by input in shortcuts. Yeah, in shortcuts. And then what are you using to parse the                |
| 04:40      | lines out? So people will know how to do that. There's a split text action. So you can split            |
| 04:44      | text by the lines. So I can capture six ideas on six lines, and then split it, and it will              |
| 04:50      | split that into six things. This used to be something you'd have to do in [[Drafts]], but                   |
| 04:54      | now you can write in shortcuts. Exactly. And then I and then it asks me for each one of                 |
| 05:00      | those if this is a quick tip idea or an automation idea or something else. And if it's something        |
| 05:05      | else, then it will ask me for more information. But the quick tip and the automation column             |
| 05:10      | ideas are then just automatically dumped straight into OmniFocus. And these are really, really          |
| 05:17      | useful because then I don't have to think about what it is that I'm thinking about for                  |
| 05:20      | the suite setup. I just know it's it's an idea that's going to go on the suite setup.                   |
| 05:24      | Oh, great. And now I can split it and define it afterwards, which is one of the key things              |
| 05:29      | for capture I find like sometimes I just want to be able to get the idea down and then do               |
| 05:33      | a little bit of processing after I've written it down, which is where I do use [[Drafts]] for               |
| 05:38      | this as well. I actually have similar actions in [[Drafts]] and in shortcuts just depends on                |
| 05:43      | what mood I'm in as to which one I go to for these.                                                     |
| 05:46      | Yeah. So a couple of ways you could do this, like if you had several of them, I have just               |
| 05:52      | made several separate shortcut scripts. And then I have a one button on my home screen.                 |
| 05:58      | I call it the Omni button. And if I press that, there is a choose from menu command                     |
| 06:04      | using shortcuts. So each one has its own choose from menu. And I can just tap the one I want.           |
| 06:08      | And then it takes me right in. You could also do that inside a single shortcut, which I                 |
| 06:15      | kind of am doing when you think about it with the thing I'm doing that the actual shortcut              |
| 06:19      | that I saved my home screen is a single shortcut that kind of encapsulates them all, but they're        |
| 06:24      | not built into it. What I'm doing is run shortcut for each choose from menu that can go through         |
| 06:29      | and modify them. What Rose is doing is a little, it's a little more fancy really, because you're        |
| 06:34      | going through and you're putting the text input in a text field, and then having the                    |
| 06:39      | shortcut go through and categorise them for you after you've created the text, which is                 |
| 06:43      | kind of an interesting take on it. Another thing I would do with this stuff, I would                    |
| 06:48      | recommend, and this is very Omni focus specific, but I know that they have similar techniques           |
| 06:53      | for things, which is another really powerful task manager is templating projects. Don't                 |
| 06:58      | just template tasks. And with Omni focus, that's a whole thing. Like in my Omni focus                   |
| 07:04      | field guide, there's like 45 minutes of video explaining how to create template projects,               |
| 07:08      | but you can create very complex projects that run and it works the same way. Shortcuts will             |
| 07:14      | ask you what's the name of the client, you know, what are you trying to do? And then                    |
| 07:18      | it'll spin up like a 10 item project for you. And you can say, you know, you can do a lot               |
| 07:25      | of stuff with it, you can make it, whether it's flagged or the type of project it is                    |
| 07:29      | or where it belongs. And I create probably half of my tasks, if not more through these                  |
| 07:35      | templated projects.                                                                                     |
| 07:37      | I do the same thing as well. I have a lot of things that happen with templated projects.                |
| 07:43      | And I use actually use [[Drafts]] for this. And I've got a whole action group, I'll link to                 |
| 07:47      | it in the show notes to the blog post I wrote on how it all works. But you can put variables            |
| 07:52      | in and have them replaced inside of [[Drafts]]. And there's an action in this action group.                 |
| 07:57      | I may need to push an update to the draft site so that that'll be on my to do list to                   |
| 08:02      | make sure it's done, where you can then generate a URL encoded version of this. And this is             |
| 08:08      | something that I am taking a lot of advantage off because, for example, when I get new show             |
| 08:15      | assigned to me from screencasts online, that isn't a single task create show. There's a                 |
| 08:19      | whole series of things I need to do there to make sure that the show goes as well as                    |
| 08:24      | it possibly can.                                                                                        |
| 08:25      | And so what I do is I use MailDrop as Zapier. So Zapier does a couple of different things.              |
| 08:31      | It sets up toggle projects for me, it creates [[Dropbox]] folders and all sorts of things. But              |
| 08:36      | it also adds a task to my only focus by a MailDrop that says, hey, create the project                   |
| 08:42      | for this show. And then inside of Zapier, I have the actual note is a URL, which is                     |
| 08:51      | an OmniFocus [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] URL, which actually runs and it adds this project for me. And                   |
| 08:58      | so what I've done inside of Zapier is I replace a couple of the pieces of information with              |
| 09:05      | variables parsed out from the record that triggers my automation. And then when I get                   |
| 09:11      | that, when I see that action, that's always due the same day that it gets added. Because                |
| 09:16      | I've got a couple of other automations, which we can get to later that make that happen.                |
| 09:21      | But essentially what I can do is I see this task and I just tap the URL in the note and                 |
| 09:26      | it adds my project for me and I'm done. And that has been a game changer because I set                  |
| 09:31      | this up so that it's in [[Drafts]] and I can copy the [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] URL to my clipboard easily.                |
| 09:37      | And then I can paste that somewhere else like Zapier so that I can have a task, which is                |
| 09:42      | a task to create a project. So it's a meta task, but it helps me get things done.                       |
| 09:47      | Okay, I want to talk about why you do it that way. But first I want to just for contrast                |
| 09:52      | explain how I do it. And yeah, go ahead. So I have the OmniFocus has the ability to import              |
| 09:57      | Taskpaper format projects. And Taskpaper format, it's kind of beyond the scope of today's             |
| 10:03      | show, but it's a very simple syntax. And you can, you know, you can write in a task. And                |
| 10:09      | then you hit return and underneath it, you can put sub tasks. And then with the at symbol,              |
| 10:15      | you can like if you want to be flagged, you put the at symbol and write flagged at the                  |
| 10:20      | end of it at the end of the task. And then then it imports it as a flag task, just to                   |
| 10:24      | give you an example, but you can set due dates start dates. You can project types, you can              |
| 10:30      | control almost anything that you can do an OmniFocus using this quite simple syntax.                    |
| 10:36      | And so what I do is I when I make a template project, I put that together in the text field             |
| 10:43      | in shortcuts. And this is the worst part of the way I do it, because the text field in                  |
| 10:47      | shortcuts is small, and it's hard to read and you have to scroll through it. But then                   |
| 10:51      | I go through and actually create the variables in shortcuts. So like an example, if I'm making          |
| 10:56      | a new company for a client, I have the name of the new company, I'll have the name of                   |
| 11:02      | the jurisdiction, you know, usually it's California, but sometimes for me it's Delaware or somewhere    |
| 11:06      | else. And then some other bits that I need for creating the new project. And once I hit                 |
| 11:12      | go, then shortcuts says, Hey, Dave, you need a new company, you know, what's, and it'll                 |
| 11:18      | say, you know, what state and it's a choose from list. I picked the state because there's               |
| 11:21      | only a few states I really do these out of. And then what's the name of the company. And                |
| 11:26      | then, you know, I fill in the data, then shortcuts replaces those variables in that Taskpaper          |
| 11:31      | formatted text. And then it runs a simple command in shortcuts that creates the project                 |
| 11:36      | in OmniFocus. And when it's done, I'll have like 15 steps to making a new company, everything           |
| 11:42      | from getting client approval for the articles of incorporation to the very end when we're               |
| 11:47      | signing share certificates and everything in between, you know, dealing with the secretary              |
| 11:50      | of state, paying the, you know, paying to get the corporate book printed and all that                   |
| 11:54      | stuff gets added. And it's a very linear process for me. And I, you know, perfected it over             |
| 11:59      | the years. But, you know, somebody says, make a new company. I open up my Omni button on                |
| 12:06      | my home screen. I get to that, you know, I get to that template, I push a button and                    |
| 12:11      | then it's added to OmniFocus for me. Now, the reason I don't like the way I do it is because            |
| 12:16      | managing that text on that little screen, even on an iPad is quite difficult. And every                 |
| 12:22      | time I see the gang from shortcuts, I talk to them about that, you know, but the reason                 |
| 12:29      | I like it is I just don't trust having it go through multiple applications. So you're                   |
| 12:35      | working with [[Drafts]], Zapier, the OmniFocus web service. And it's like, you've got it                    |
| 12:41      | running through so many different platforms to get there that that just kind of scares                  |
| 12:45      | me a little bit.                                                                                        |
| 12:46      | Yeah. Well, in my case, so a little bit of background, the way that a lot of my projects                |
| 12:51      | are created, I have the template in [[Drafts]], and I run a draft section and that creates                  |
| 12:55      | it in OmniFocus for me. And that's it. That's the end of it. But specifically for things                |
| 13:00      | like screencasts online, where all of this data is already provided by the system that                  |
| 13:07      | screencasts online uses in the background, Podio, that was mentioned in our episode with                |
| 13:12      | Don McAllister. Because I already have this information, essentially the variables that                |
| 13:17      | I would use to fill this out, I thought I can go a step further and actually completely                 |
| 13:24      | automate the filling out of the variables so that I don't have to try and talk to Podio                 |
| 13:30      | in the background or to parse this data and put it into [[Airtable]] when I really only needed              |
| 13:34      | to make an OmniFocus project so that I can then run a shortcut. So I just want something                |
| 13:40      | inside of my OmniFocus that says, hey, like you need to create this task. So what happens               |
| 13:47      | is a new show is assigned to me, and this has a ton of information in there. And then                   |
| 13:54      | I've experimented with two ways, and I need to check which way that I'm doing this, but                 |
| 13:58      | I have a format text action. And so I have the text, which is the copy of my project,                   |
| 14:05      | and I replace the variables that I need replacing with, for example, the name of the show, what         |
| 14:11      | I'm doing an episode about. So for example, a recent one was [[Drafts]] for Mac. And this                   |
| 14:17      | gets put into there, and then it encodes it as a URL for me. And then I can have the start              |
| 14:24      | of the URL in the note and then just reference that variable from the variable to formatted             |
| 14:30      | text, which is really useful and makes it quite easy to edit if I need to. Because as                   |
| 14:35      | you said, that's the problem with doing everything in shortcuts, you end up with a very small           |
| 14:38      | box, which is why I much prefer to handle this inside of [[Drafts]], because then I can                     |
| 14:44      | see everything at once. It doesn't matter if I've got a 12.9 inch iPad or an iPhone                     |
| 14:49      | SE, the text will fill my screen instead of being a very small box on my screen.                        |
| 14:56      | And I think the way you do it makes a lot of sense. I've got so many built in the old                   |
| 15:03      | fashion that it's hard for me to just fathom wrapping in my head around, okay, I'm going                |
| 15:07      | to put it in two different systems. In general, all of my things, the primary                           |
| 15:12      | source for my templates is [[Drafts]]. So if I need to change something, I'll go into [[Drafts]]               |
| 15:16      | and then I actually have, this is really nerdy, I have a list, I have a draft with which references     |
| 15:23      | my other [[Drafts]] by their UUID, that's the [[Drafts]], universally unique identifier, and                    |
| 15:28      | tells me where I've used these templates in other places. So it tells me the name of the                |
| 15:33      | Zapier's app that's using this. And I do have to manually keep this up to date. But that                |
| 15:38      | means that when I make a change, I can go look it up and see where else I need to go                    |
| 15:43      | and update this, just in case. Huge automators power tip there is in [[Drafts]],                            |
| 15:47      | you can get a unique identifier for every single draft you make, which is way easier                    |
| 15:53      | than if you're using Apple Notes and you have to use a goofy search technique and hope that             |
| 15:57      | you get the right one. I mean, the way I do it in Notes is I actually create a unique                   |
| 16:02      | identifier, which is a strange string of text and I just searched for it that would only                |
| 16:06      | be in that one note, but that is like a total hack and the [[Drafts]] does it so much better.               |
| 16:12      | I think we're going to do show at some point, just talking through [[Drafts]] and how we automate           |
| 16:16      | with it, because there is so much you can do with it now that it's on the back too.                     |
| 16:19      | But the the I wanted to just to kind of put a point on this in terms of capturing tasks                 |
| 16:27      | through project templates, whether you use [[Apple Reminders]] or a text list or something                  |
| 16:35      | fancy like OmniFocus, this is a technique I just can't recommend enough if you're interested            |
| 16:40      | in automation. This makes so much sense. I got inspired to do this after reading a book                 |
| 16:45      | a few years ago called [The Checklist Manifesto](https://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/). It was a book by a surgeon just talking about           |
| 16:50      | you know how they're so careful like pilots and surgeons when they use these checklists                 |
| 16:55      | because nothing ever goes wrong. And I broke my life down into repeatable projects that                 |
| 17:01      | I do all the time. And I just decided I'm not going to make mistakes on those ever.                     |
| 17:06      | And the way I'll do that is by having a checklist and then of course the automated brain kicked         |
| 17:09      | in and I I'm not kidding. I have probably I haven't counted them, but at least 30 of                    |
| 17:15      | these templated projects. And I have so many that when I open up the the shortcut to to                 |
| 17:21      | pick one, I had to make it a shortcut within a shortcut. If that makes sense, I've got                  |
| 17:27      | one thing I pick as category, you know, like personal, max, Sparky or legal, because if                 |
| 17:32      | I just had them all on the screen once, I wouldn't be able to see them all. You know,                   |
| 17:35      | it's just too many. So it like it doesn't choose from menu and then it goes through                     |
| 17:39      | another shortcut that does another choose from menu. So they're nested because there's                  |
| 17:44      | so many of them. But I use this every day. And if you're looking to have automation help                |
| 17:49      | you, I really think this is something you should take some time. And you don't have                     |
| 17:53      | to build 30 this weekend. What I would recommend is just take the next thing you do. That's             |
| 17:57      | a repeated project and build one for that one and get it dialed in and start using it                   |
| 18:02      | and then out, you know, just do one at a time, but you'll be surprised how quickly these                |
| 18:06      | things go.                                                                                              |
| 18:07      | Yes. And something else that we should mention, you know, we're talking about OmniFocus here,           |
| 18:12      | but in [[Things]], which is also another popular task management system has really good [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]]                 |
| 18:19      | support. And you might be going, aren't [[URL Schemes]] kind of outdated? And to some extent,        |
| 18:24      | yes, they are. But because you can use there, there's a [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] generator on the [[Things]]              |
| 18:29      | website. So you don't have to manually write everything by hand. So you can go in and tap               |
| 18:34      | on the add project option, for example, and then you can give it a title and you can specify            |
| 18:38      | notes and to-dos. And then you can copy that URL. And that's something else you could paste             |
| 18:44      | that into [[Shortcuts]] and replace certain words in the URL with variables. And there you go.              |
| 18:49      | You've got a really nice template ready to go and you can fill it in with other information             |
| 18:53      | as necessary. It's not quite as easy as the [[Taskpaper]] format, but it's definitely deserving            |
| 18:59      | of a mention.                                                                                           |
| 19:00      | Yeah. And both of those apps have done a really good job of making it easier for users to               |
| 19:04      | create template projects. You know, you get, you build them and then you always have the                |
| 19:09      | checklist. And as long as you follow the checklist, you're going to be okay. And so think about         |
| 19:15      | that. And maybe add a few of them. Rose and I will share something in the show now so                   |
| 19:20      | you can see how we do it.                                                                               |

| 20:31      | All right, I want to talk kind of a related capture topic. And that is the idea of brainstorming,       |
| 20:38      | you know, sitting down, capturing a bunch of ideas. And that's not necessarily tasks                    |
| 20:43      | you're creating, but, but brainstorming. And how do we automate something like that?                    |
| 20:49      | We talked recently about my node and how you can go in and just start typing words and                  |
| 20:54      | that that's a way to do it. But I'm not sure is that really automation?                                 |
| 20:57      | Well, I mean, you can create template projects in my node. And this is going back to the                |
| 21:03      | getting things done trigger lists, which are quite popular. The idea is that it's a list                |
| 21:08      | of things. And that when you look at it, the things on that list will spark ideas of tasks              |
| 21:13      | that you need to capture or things that you need to do or whatever it is, however you                   |
| 21:17      | want to phrase it. And so I've taken that and I have a whole series of different solutions.             |
| 21:24      | But specifically from my node for project planning, I have a couple of different template               |
| 21:28      | my node documents, which I use as a basis. And it's not 100% automation necessarily,                    |
| 21:36      | but the same time a document template is automation. And so that that's a easy way to get started.      |
| 21:42      | All you have to do is you create a my node document, and then you name it with the word                 |
| 21:47      | template. And next time, instead of opening it, you tap and hold or right click and then                |
| 21:51      | duplicate instead of opening it and then edit your duplicated document and rename it.                   |
| 21:56      | That's not a bad idea. I'm just thinking, like, there's certain types of things I brainstorm            |
| 22:02      | or in my node all the time. Sometimes they're like serious lawyer letters, sometimes they're            |
| 22:08      | field guide video projects. And there are definite nodes that exist in every one. So                    |
| 22:13      | why don't I have that just show up with those already there and eliminate the tedium of                 |
| 22:18      | recreating them every time and let me get to the hard work of brainstorming faster?                     |
| 22:22      | Yeah. And I do use this for screencasts online. So the tool Don mentioned, I've completely              |
| 22:28      | blanking on the name of it now, but it's the one that's ID, what it's for project management            |
| 22:33      | where you create a new project and it automatically puts files in different places. It automatically    |
| 22:38      | creates a my node with the right nodes on it for me for every spring single screencasts                 |
| 22:43      | online show. And in fact, it even differentiates between if it's a tip show or a full show              |
| 22:48      | and puts different my node documents in the folders for different ones.                                 |
| 22:51      | I could say that. So if you're out there and you use my node or a brainstorming application,            |
| 22:56      | why not have templates to let you get to the hard work of brainstorming faster? I do think              |
| 23:03      | my node though is a great brainstorming app, even with that little bit of automation because            |
| 23:08      | it just makes it so easy to write things down and capture ideas.                                        |
| 23:11      | Yeah, it really does. And they have a [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] support, which works on iOS and macOS                  |
| 23:16      | as well. So something I've experimented with, but I'm not 100% sold on is actually using                |
| 23:22      | shortcuts to create a my node document with specific nodes. And then you can even theoretically         |
| 23:29      | customise it based on questions that you answer. But at the moment, I'm still pretty happy              |
| 23:34      | with my templates and I haven't really switched to the [[URL Schemes]].                                     |
| 23:36      | That feels like a bridge too far for me. It's like, I think I'm now making automation work              |
| 23:41      | for the sake of automation work.                                                                        |
| 23:42      | Yeah, that's kind of what it felt like I was experimenting with it going, well, it's                    |
| 23:46      | really cool in concept. And I can see for some people for certain projects that this                    |
| 23:50      | would definitely be worth it. But it's not worth it for me in the projects that I'm doing               |
| 23:55      | right now. There's not enough similarity between, for example, the tip template and the full            |
| 24:01      | show template for screencasts online, and to make it worth it for me yet.                               |
| 24:06      | Another bit of somewhat, I guess you call this automation with my node if you're a                      |
| 24:09      | my node user on the Mac, they have a quick entry bar in the menu bar, which is also,                    |
| 24:15      | it feels like automation, like, because the way I use my nodes is they're always kind                   |
| 24:19      | of like baking in the back of my brain. If an idea comes up, I can just go up to the                    |
| 24:23      | menu bar and add it to my mind node without even really getting into the mind node, which               |
| 24:27      | is, it feels pretty magical when that happens.                                                          |
| 24:30      | Yes, quick entries on iOS as well. And it even has shortcut support. So you can, you know,              |
| 24:35      | type something in a shortcut and have it dumped into quick entry, or you can tap and hold               |
| 24:40      | on the mind node app icon and jump straight into quick entry there, which is pretty nice.               |
| 24:45      | But I'm finding that I don't use it as much on iOS as I think I would like to, but I'll                 |
| 24:51      | Mac it's definitely one of my staples.                                                                  |
| 24:53      | Now, what about using brainstorming, what about brainstorming outside of something like                 |
| 24:58      | my node? And in general, I'm thinking about with a text.                                                |
| 25:02      | Well, one of the things that I do, I use shortcuts, and I have a trigger list. So this is just          |
| 25:09      | a text action in shortcuts. And I do my split text and repeat with each on those. And then              |
| 25:14      | I just pop up and ask for input box for every single one of those items. And this is great              |
| 25:19      | because you can use this with any task management system. I usually dub these to my OmniFocus           |
| 25:24      | inbox, but you could put them in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] or to do as any of them. And then it just,                   |
| 25:29      | you know, it pops up and it's like, okay, groceries. And then they're go, Oh, right.                    |
| 25:32      | Yeah. So I actually, I need to go buy spicy carrots or something to borrow from one of                  |
| 25:36      | your previous screencasts or chocolate in my case is pretty much always on that list.                   |
| 25:41      | auto fill chocolate. Yeah, I should probably just start auto                                             |
| 25:46      | filling chocolate. But then when you were in the US, did I get you any US chocolate or                  |
| 25:51      | you were not interested? We actually got some chocolate at Macstock.                                      |
| 25:55      | We went to a fancy chocolate place. And it was good. It was a very nice chocolate place                 |
| 26:00      | and they had good chocolate. But I've, I have to say, I've not eaten normal US chocolate.               |
| 26:05      | I don't think not in a long time on purpose. Take care of that next time you're here.                   |
| 26:09      | You're going to live with the rest of us just for one day.                                              |
| 26:14      | Fine. But I'm bringing good chocolate as well. But yes, anyway, so, so, so I asked myself               |
| 26:20      | about each of these items on my trigger list. And then I add them to, you know, the appropriate         |
| 26:27      | system. Sometimes these things end up in air table because it's coming up with ideas for                |
| 26:31      | screencasts online topics that I might want to do and all of my screencasts online, you                 |
| 26:36      | know, idea dumps and management happens in air table.                                                   |
| 26:40      | Okay. I just need to understand this. So do you have an automation that asks you about                  |
| 26:47      | all these things as part of one automation, like groceries and screencasts?                             |
| 26:53      | So this is essentially, you know, sometimes you get this feeling in your head that like                 |
| 26:57      | you're forgetting something. Okay.                                                                      |
| 26:59      | That's what like the original trigger list from getting things done is for, you know,                   |
| 27:04      | I've forgotten something. And so I actually have different trigger lists for different                  |
| 27:08      | contexts. So I have like a general life one, which is usually I've gone through all of                  |
| 27:13      | my other ones. Like, you know, like this is my last resort, like something is bugging                   |
| 27:17      | me. I know I've forgotten something, but I have literally no idea what it is. It could                  |
| 27:20      | be anything. But then I also have project specific ones. So there's a big project I'm                   |
| 27:25      | working on at work. And it goes through and it asks me about all the different subsections              |
| 27:29      | of the project and asked me about every person involved in the project and a few other things           |
| 27:34      | as well. And then that usually, you know, I find something in there. And the great thing                |
| 27:39      | about shortcuts with the ask for input is if you, you tap on okay, and there's nothing                  |
| 27:45      | in there, it just, it keeps going. It works really well. And I'm finding that these, these              |
| 27:52      | trigger list shortcuts are pretty helpful. And that definitely helps me capture things.                 |
| 27:58      | And I usually end up creating tasks out of these, but you could at the same time, completely            |
| 28:03      | format it as tab intended text and send it over to my node, you know, as a, as a my node                |
| 28:10      | document afterwards, if you wanted, or put it in [[Drafts]] as a list, all sorts of things.                 |
| 28:15      | You know, I've never thought of having something like that to just capture everything or segments,      |
| 28:21      | entire segments of your life. I guess I should experiment with it. I don't know. I mean,                |
| 28:26      | it doesn't, I'm not sure I need it, but maybe I do.                                                     |
| 28:28      | Maybe you're better captured than I am. Yeah.                                                           |
| 28:30      | I usually run through a couple of these as part of my, you know, the run up to my in                    |
| 28:35      | my bigger weekly review. So, you know, I'm there at the end of the week on Friday at                    |
| 28:39      | work and I'm there go, okay, so what's happening on this project, what's happening on that              |
| 28:43      | project, it's, it's to help me review specific projects in many cases and areas of my life              |
| 28:48      | in others.                                                                                              |
| 28:49      | I will tell you that I feel like I've been doing it so long that I'm very hardwired to                  |
| 28:54      | adding items to OmniFocus inbox. I mean, I use the watch app all the time, you know,                    |
| 28:59      | with the, is this, I'm not sure this is automation, but with the watch app, you just open OmniFocus     |
| 29:05      | and you press hard against the face and then you can talk and it adds an item to your inbox.            |
| 29:10      | I do that several times a day and then the keyboard shortcuts and the things you can                    |
| 29:15      | do on the iPad. I, like, I'm adding stuff in there all the time and interestingly I've                  |
| 29:20      | been doing it so long, I don't even think about it now. It's just like something comes                  |
| 29:23      | to the brain, put it in there, move on, I don't dwell on it at all. And then every day                  |
| 29:28      | is part of my shutdown routine, I go through that inbox. So I, I have kind of a system                  |
| 29:32      | for that where I don't need to trigger things, but I don't know, I do like the idea of trying           |
| 29:38      | to like, you know, farm your, your mind for ideas that are buried you haven't thought                   |
| 29:42      | about like with, with a trigger phrase or a specific query.                                             |
| 29:46      | Yeah. Well, in my case, I'm definitely not as disciplined as you are and I'm not as good                |
| 29:52      | at following my own rules. I have great plans and I do my best to follow through on them,               |
| 29:56      | but I, I, I often mess up and I'm not able to capture something when I want to capture                  |
| 30:01      | something. It usually happens just as I'm walking out the door with my hands full or                    |
| 30:05      | something, I think of something and then it's gone before I get a chance to put my bags                 |
| 30:10      | down and get, get a device so I can capture it, you know, even, even with capture on the                |
| 30:14      | Apple watch, it's difficult to, to actually capture everything even when with your hands                |
| 30:19      | full.                                                                                                   |
| 30:20      | And do you run these scripts? I usually run them as part of a review process. So like                   |
| 30:25      | you, I've split my review into multiple sections. So I do different parts of reviews pretty             |
| 30:29      | much every day, but it then helps me to, to capture things. So, you know, when I'm, when                |
| 30:35      | I'm doing my, my time blocking for the next week of the things that I need to do, then                  |
| 30:39      | it also comes up and it's there. Okay. So these are all of your time blocks. Is there                   |
| 30:44      | a thing you need to capture related to these time blocks? And then they're going, Oh, right.            |
| 30:48      | Well, yes, I had this idea and oh yeah, that thing over there. And oh yeah, I need to make              |
| 30:51      | sure that I buy new content lens solution. Because that pops into my head while I'm                     |
| 30:56      | doing these things. So I've tried to build capture into a lot of different areas.                       |
| 30:59      | Yeah. What, one of the tricks of time blocks, this is more productivity than automation,                |
| 31:04      | but give yourself enough time to wrap up what you're doing.                                             |
| 31:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 31:08      | If your time blocks, you have to rush from, you know, if you spend the time at the end                  |
| 31:11      | to wrap it up, like deal with new ideas and things before you move on to the next thing,                |
| 31:17      | you will sleep better. That's, that's, yeah, that's a big chip. But another piece of automation         |
| 31:22      | related to all of these lists, I think worth mentioning is OPML. And was it open processor              |
| 31:30      | markup language? What is it again?                                                                      |
| 31:33      | I think that's it.                                                                                      |
| 31:35      | I used to know it by heart and I forgot to senior moment, sorry, but it's basically the                 |
| 31:40      | outline open source format that allows you to move data in an outline format between applications.      |
| 31:49      | And just about every outline program and mind mapping program where their salt can read                 |
| 31:55      | and save to OPML. So that gives you data portability as automators. We like that. And like I sometimes  |
| 32:03      | I will take a, a my node file and take the OPML out of it and put it into a one liner                    |
| 32:09      | file because you can move OPML between the two. So if you're thinking about automation                  |
| 32:14      | and moving between multiple applications, figure out OPML. It's not that hard.                          |
| 32:20      | Yeah. I mean, there's not a lot to figure out. Just know that it exists and use it essentially.         |
| 32:25      | Like that, that's the key to that. You can create it. And I have to say, I have automated               |
| 32:30      | the creation of OPML before from a very complicated hierarchy of things at work where people wanted     |
| 32:35      | a pretty diagram and I was there going, huh, my notes good at pretty diagrams. So I automated           |
| 32:40      | the creation of OPML by reading things in. I think I actually created JSON and found a library          |
| 32:45      | that could convert it to OPML. Now you're just showing off Rose. Let's be honest.                       |
| 32:48      | Well, it's not something I would recommend for most people, but if you have a use case for it,          |
| 32:53      | you absolutely can do it. So it's doable, but in general, just know OPML exists and export              |
| 33:00      | us OPML and import from OPML and be happy. I have in my studio, I have a little pad of paper            |
| 33:08      | and sometimes when someone's talking to me on the phone, I will, for whatever reason,                   |
| 33:14      | get out a pen or a pencil and write little diagrams and ideas on this piece of paper.                   |
| 33:19      | How am I going to automate that? Well, I mean, you could take a photo and try and run optical           |
| 33:24      | character recognition through Toolbox Pro on it that I don't know about you when I draw these           |
| 33:29      | diagrams, especially if I try doing mind mapping on paper. I seem to have an aversion to writing in     |
| 33:35      | a straight line. So I end up writing at all sorts of angles. And if you run that through                |
| 33:40      | optical character recognition, it can get a little bit weird, which is to say, very unexpected          |
| 33:47      | results, sometimes very interesting results. I'm sure I've created many new words by doing this.        |
| 33:53      | But in general, at the moment, I'm just taking a photograph of these things. And depending              |
| 33:56      | on what it is, it might get attached to a task in OmniFocus or get put into [[DEVONthink]],              |
| 34:01      | or even occasionally these things end up in [[Day One]]. But a lot of the time I take a photo as            |
| 34:07      | reference and then convert it to whatever its finished format is at some point.                         |
| 34:12      | Yeah, that's what I do too. The only people that ever see those are me, because if you saw them,        |
| 34:17      | you'd think it was like the scribblings of a crazy man. But a lot of times, it's a good                 |
| 34:22      | starting point for me. I'll also do it on the iPad now. I've got a big iPad, and there's a              |
| 34:28      | couple apps. Canvas is one of them that I can think about. And where you can do that digitally,         |
| 34:34      | which is nice. But if you do it on paper, I don't think there's a lot of automation secrets to          |
| 34:39      | magically turn that into something usable. But just capture it. Use your automation prowess to          |
| 34:46      | save a copy of it so you've got access to it in the future. Yeah. And I think that that's pretty        |
| 34:51      | much the key there. This episode of The Automators is brought to you by ExpressVPN. Go to ExpressVPN    |

| 36:36      | So we've done a lot about capture, but I think something else that is worth at least                    |
| 36:43      | automating with the setup of things is review. You know, you can theoretically completely               |
| 36:49      | automate the review of something, but when I can feed my brain into an AI, then I will be happy         |
| 36:53      | that my review is automated. But for the time being, I still need to do some things manually.           |
| 36:57      | But there's a lot of things that you can automate. And I know that for me, the key thing is review      |
| 37:03      | frequency, because some things need reviewing way more frequently than other things. And so I'm         |
| 37:11      | using OmniFocus and their review intervals to handle this. But you could also quite easily              |
| 37:17      | create a list somewhere and have shortcuts automatically tell you, okay, this is the                    |
| 37:23      | third day, so therefore you need to review these projects, or this is the fourth day,                   |
| 37:26      | so you need to review those projects instead, third or fourth day of the week or a month,               |
| 37:32      | depending on how you do things, that would be possible. And I really enjoy the fact that I              |
| 37:38      | don't have to sit down and review, I think it's 120 projects in OmniFocus right now,                    |
| 37:43      | all on one day at the same time. I can split that up.                                                   |
| 37:47      | Yeah, I mean, my OmniFocus database has many, many projects because, you know,                          |
| 37:52      | each client may have between, you know, two and five projects. And so having the ability                |
| 37:58      | to stagger review is hugely important to me. But this is a piece of this show that I think              |
| 38:04      | particularly is useful to non OmniFocus users, because review is very automated in OmniFocus,           |
| 38:13      | you can set like, this is a thing I only want to get a review reminder every six months,                |
| 38:17      | or I want to get one every two days, it's up to the user to decide,                                     |
| 38:22      | which is a great feature in the application, one of the reasons I use the application,                  |
| 38:25      | honestly. But it's striking to me that other task managers don't have built in review techniques        |
| 38:33      | like this. And so if you're an automator, you could probably kind of, you know,                         |
| 38:38      | hack your own review process together through a variety of different ways, like one of the              |
| 38:44      | ways I was thinking about doing this would be just to have a list of project names and then have,       |
| 38:50      | you could do it with a calendar, or you could do it with shortcuts. But either way, you could have      |
| 38:54      | a timed reminder showing up to do the reviews based on automation.                                      |
| 39:00      | Absolutely. And that I have to say, I am doing that because I found that it was occasionally            |
| 39:06      | skipping reviews. So what I am doing now is I am having, I am having shortcuts prompt me                |
| 39:13      | on my iPad specifically, every evening, approximately when I would usually get home,                    |
| 39:18      | I'm doing this as a time based automation rather than location based, because I don't always go         |
| 39:23      | to work, I sometimes work from home. And it pops up and it reminds me to do my review,                  |
| 39:28      | and it just takes me to the review area of OmniFocus. And that is really helpful. And I'm               |
| 39:34      | just thinking, you know, [[Todoist]] has got an API and it's a pretty good API. So you can theoretically    |
| 39:40      | get all of your projects out of [[Todoist]] via an API, and you could do this with shortcuts or             |
| 39:45      | anything else, and then go through them and jump to them. That would be doable. And I'm sure you        |
| 39:52      | can do that pretty much any web based automated, web based task management system.                      |
| 39:58      | Yeah, you could also have if you have the ability to automatically create tasks related to projects     |
| 40:03      | in your task manager, you could create a review this project task. And that's something you would       |
| 40:09      | definitely want to automate because who wants to create that 120 times. And if you can set it on a      |
| 40:15      | repeat timer, you could then set the specific timer as well. So you only see it whenever you want.      |
| 40:19      | Yes. And I find this is really useful because then what I do, a part of my automation, so,              |
| 40:25      | you know, shortcuts prompts me to open OmniFocus, but then I actually put shortcuts on the other        |
| 40:30      | part of my screen. So I'm doing this on my iPad. And so I've got approximately two third and one        |
| 40:35      | third split. But for certain projects, I have, you know, we talked about this earlier, I have           |
| 40:41      | the shortcuts that I run to help me to help me remember things that I need to do. But for other         |
| 40:46      | things, you know, there are just things I need to run shortcuts to capture a bunch of items.            |
| 40:50      | So say at the end of the month, I'm there and I'm looking at it, and it's there going, oh,              |
| 40:53      | yeah, you know, so like, I can see that this task is coming up to create all of my invoicing actions    |
| 40:58      | ready for next month. And I can run that shortcut right there. And then to do that, I should actually   |
| 41:04      | start using launch cuts for this and have a group of review related tasks shortcuts and just open       |
| 41:11      | that folder that would make my life much easier. Yeah. Launch cuts is really helpful for things         |
| 41:17      | like this, where you just need a subset of your shortcuts available because it actually offers          |
| 41:21      | folders. Oh, thank you, [[Adam Tow]], who was recently a guest on the show. We'll make sure there's a       |
| 41:25      | link to launch cuts in the show notes. So I think I just found an upgrade for myself there. But that    |
| 41:31      | means that then I can run these shortcuts for things I need to do. Because I have a lot of meta         |
| 41:37      | tasks that end up in my OmniFocus, you know, like, make sure that I've created all my invoices for      |
| 41:41      | the month and things like that so that I actually get everything done that needs doing. But because     |
| 41:48      | it's automation in there somewhere, then I have to do the automation at some point.                     |
| 41:53      | Yeah. So just having the ability to go through the task and do the automation                           |
| 41:58      | allows you to knock a lot out. I do a similar thing with dictation as well. Like in the morning,        |
| 42:03      | once I have my list of tasks for the day, one of the things I'll do is I'll just look through it        |
| 42:07      | and anything I can manage with quick dictation, I'll dictate a text file with all of that stuff.        |
| 42:13      | So there'll be several emails or even a short blog post or whatever. And it just, I just bang           |
| 42:19      | through that in like 15 minutes and get sometimes knocked out, you know, between, you know, two and     |
| 42:25      | 10 tasks. And it feels really good just knocking that out. But why not use shortcuts as another way     |
| 42:31      | to knock through those tasks as well. Assuming you have all the automation built for it, that           |
| 42:37      | that could be it could be diversion to if you see like, Oh, I should automate that. Then suddenly       |
| 42:41      | you'd spend the rest of the day doing that. So you got to like figure it out. Yeah. Well,               |
| 42:45      | I have to say that's one of the shortcuts. So you mentioned earlier, you have, you know,                |
| 42:49      | the shortcut that will just capture a specific type of task. I have an automation task shortcut.        |
| 42:55      | That's a good idea. This, this sounds crazy. But essentially, all it is is create this automation.      |
| 43:00      | Because then I end up with things like, for example, I recently wrote a script that runs on             |
| 43:05      | my server, it fetches data from [[Airtable]], and it renames toggle projects when, when they need to        |
| 43:12      | be renamed. And this is really helpful. But I've had that idea kicking around for six months.           |
| 43:19      | Now it's very easy to say, Oh, yeah, I'll just create a shortcut to do that. And I tried and            |
| 43:22      | failed a couple of times because I had issues with the toggle API. It's not, it probably                |
| 43:28      | isn't that complex and hindsight, but you know, that was what I needed. And, you know, but so           |
| 43:35      | when I, when I'm there going, Oh yeah, I should probably automate this. The shortcut that I run is      |
| 43:39      | create an automation too. And then whatever it is I type in so that I don't get sidetracked every       |
| 43:46      | time I'm doing a review by doing these things. And that also means I don't have to leave wherever       |
| 43:51      | I am or make sure that I remember to classify under this project with that tag and all of these         |
| 43:57      | other things. I just add that information and it puts it in the right place for me so I don't lose      |
| 44:01      | the flow of what I'm doing. Yeah, I have one of those too. Interesting. I don't do that nominee         |
| 44:06      | focus. I just, it's a pins to note. It depends to an Apple note. And anytime I feel like I want to      |
| 44:12      | do some automation, like, you know, for me, this is like fun. So like, at the end of the day,           |
| 44:19      | maybe I just want to goof off and create some automation and I'll open that note and pick one.          |
| 44:24      | It kind of reminds me of when app developers have a list of features and they let users vote            |
| 44:29      | on what feature to work on next. To me, I kind of have my internal voting                               |
| 44:34      | going on as I look through that list. And there's things that have been on there for like a year        |
| 44:38      | that I don't know if I'll ever get around to. And there's things I put on there that go immediately     |
| 44:41      | to the top of the list. But you do need to have the discipline to tell yourself, okay, I can think      |
| 44:47      | of this idea. I'll add it to my list of things I want to automate. I'm not going to stop right now      |
| 44:51      | and do that because then you're using automation to actually avoid your work, which isn't necessarily   |
| 44:56      | something we recommend here on the automators. Yes. That said, it can be, you know, if you're           |
| 45:02      | stuck on something, picking up an automation related to that task and making that can be an             |
| 45:08      | excellent way to get yourself unstuck because whilst you're noodling on a related problem,              |
| 45:13      | then you can often figure out other things. Similar to talking to a rubber duck, but more fun.          |
| 45:17      | Now you do some other stuff with review that I don't that I thought was really interesting in           |
| 45:21      | terms of like looking for next actions and actually even pulling completed tasks out for your daily     |
| 45:28      | log. Explain how that works. Okay, so OmniFocus recently added an action and people have been           |
| 45:34      | doing this with [[AppleScript]] for ages, but they added a shortcut action that allows you to query        |
| 45:40      | OmniFocus for things. So it could be anything. What I specifically do is I look for anything            |
| 45:46      | that's completed and I try and get all things that are completed today so that then I can look at       |
| 45:52      | those and go and so I run this at the end of the day to be clear. And I have a look at them and         |
| 45:57      | maybe I've checked off, you know, by content lens solution and then I go, oh yeah, I need to check,     |
| 46:02      | you know, when did I last replace my content lens case? Instead of actually doing that right now,       |
| 46:07      | I can, you know, I look at these and I add my extra ideas that are created thanks to reviewing          |
| 46:13      | my completed actions back into my OmniFocus and then I take my completed actions and anything           |
| 46:19      | that's not a routine task. So if it doesn't have a routine tag, then that gets put into [[Day One]] for     |
| 46:25      | me so that I can look back and go, hey, I did stuff today. Yeah, see that part doesn't appeal to me     |
| 46:30      | of like journalling everything I checked off today. Yeah, I don't journal everything. So I have,         |
| 46:37      | I have a fairly fine grain set of filters. So specifically, you know, like things that are              |
| 46:42      | related to different areas of my life do get filtered, but stuff that I do at work, well,               |
| 46:46      | you know, that's, that's all locked at work. They need to know that, but I don't need that in my        |
| 46:50      | [[Day One]]. Thank you very much. That's fine. No, I mean, I totally get, and I think it could be           |
| 46:54      | something, it's totally legitimate use of the data. And I think there's a lot of people like it.        |
| 46:58      | But for me, I just don't want to do that. But the, and I was thinking it was silly when you're          |
| 47:03      | telling me about, but then I got thinking, it's like so often, so I bill for my time as a lawyer.       |
| 47:09      | And it's not uncommon for me to get to the end of the day and realise that I forgot to                  |
| 47:15      | bill for something I did, you know, like sometimes I'll spend an hour working on a client, but then     |
| 47:19      | I get sidetracked and then I never record my time for it. That actually would be a good                 |
| 47:26      | shortcut automation to run for me, just to look at the end of the day to run off the things I           |
| 47:31      | completed versus the things I billed and say, oh, wait, I did that thing and I didn't bill for it       |
| 47:35      | because it costs me money, right? I mean, then you're working for free. So I actually, I'd              |
| 47:40      | probably need to implement this and put this in this part of my shutdown routine to run that            |
| 47:44      | automation. But that's a good one. And I hadn't really thought about it because I know that's a         |
| 47:47      | new tool. I just, I never really thought of a good use for it until just this moment as you were        |
| 47:52      | describing it. Yeah, I find it really, really handy just because, you know, then I can do it at work    |
| 47:59      | at the end of the week. So actually, as part of my work review, I have a look at the things that        |
| 48:03      | I've checked off in OmniFocus and just make sure, you know, have I handled those? Because if I haven't  |
| 48:10      | handled everything properly and maybe it happens every once in a while, you know, you check something   |
| 48:15      | off without meaning to or you think it's done and then actually you look at it afterwards and you're    |
| 48:19      | like, oh, no, that's actually not finished. Being able to have a look at these and figure out, oh,      |
| 48:24      | yeah, I should probably fix that. It's pretty handy. So I like doing that.                              |
| 48:30      | So the mechanism you're using is just writing the query for completed tasks in a specific               |
| 48:35      | time frame. And then you're giving it back to yourself as a text list or how are you reporting          |
| 48:40      | the data out of shortcuts? So what I'm doing at the moment is I repeat with each on all of these        |
| 48:48      | actions. And I just ask myself for input and then send that back to OmniFocus. And I'm still fine       |
| 48:53      | tuning exactly how I'm filtering that so that I can then send the right information to [[Day One]],         |
| 48:58      | because I would actually like to put different chunks of information into different [[Day One]]             |
| 49:03      | journals. But I definitely don't want a [[Day One]] entry for every single task that I've completed.        |
| 49:10      | That is the one thing I do not want it under any circumstances. It would be a great way to fill         |
| 49:16      | up [[Day One]]. And it would make me look like I'm a very prolific journaler, which I'm not. I wish I       |
| 49:21      | was, but it's one of those things where I'm there going, okay, yeah, so I need to figure this out.      |
| 49:26      | And I didn't want to be running the find actions or find items action multiple time. But I think        |
| 49:34      | I'm just going to stick with doing that for now, because it's not that complex to do so.                |
| 49:40      | And it works pretty nicely. And using the repeat with each command will allow forces you to see         |
| 49:45      | each one as it goes through. So then you can realise, oh, I'm not done with this or whatever,           |
| 49:49      | you know. Yeah, exactly. And at the moment, I don't have any mechanism for editing these tasks          |
| 49:55      | or going back to them or anything like that. I've not built any of that in. I believe,                  |
| 50:00      | and I'm just double checking as I speak, that you can go to the URL of an item. No,                     |
| 50:06      | you can't actually at the moment. But I know Omni Group are working on ways to edit actions              |
| 50:14      | via shortcuts so that then when you look at it, you can say, oh, yeah, I actually need to edit this     |
| 50:19      | and do something with it, like uncompleted or whatever. But that's not there yet.                       |
| 50:23      | And I really want to, I'm so curious once they really dial in the full automation                       |
| 50:32      | script support for OmniFocus that they've been working on. I just want to see,                          |
| 50:36      | because like we can create our own features in the application. It's like the Automator Dream.          |
| 50:40      | And, you know, that's kind of what you're doing with this review of completed tasks. So,                |
| 50:47      | and that's just like a taste. I feel like there's so much more that we're going to get once they        |
| 50:51      | finish that. Yes. Well, I've been playing with the Omni Automation as it's called,                      |
| 50:55      | which is a JavaScript scripting for OmniFocus. And I have to say, it's definitely a super               |
| 51:01      | parry user feature. You know, you're going to have to get really nerdy if you want to write             |
| 51:04      | these scripts the same way if you would, if you want to write nerdy scripts to automate [[Drafts]]         |
| 51:09      | or something. You know, only this is an entire task management application with all of the              |
| 51:14      | bells and whistles that go with it. So there's a lot of stuff in there. I was playing today with        |
| 51:18      | the duplicate task action. And that I'm going to have some fun with. But it's, it's, it can be          |
| 51:26      | complex, but I think we're going to have fun when we can actually do all of that.                       |
| 51:30      | But also that's all shareable. So like once we kind of, the nerds of us really figure it out,           |
| 51:35      | we can share these scripts and even typical users that are aware of them can run them. So,              |
| 51:41      | you know, you don't have to learn JavaScript to, to do these scripts. I mean, and honestly,             |
| 51:47      | once you go in, you can probably make small tweaks even that it's just like AppleScript and all        |
| 51:52      | these other scripting languages. One of the best ways to learn it is to take one that works and         |
| 51:56      | break it and then try and fix it, you know, and make it work for you. Definitely. Anyway, that's,       |
| 52:03      | that's some powerful review stuff that I'd never really considered as review, but you know, it          |
| 52:08      | absolutely is. Yeah, it's, it's one of those things where sometimes you just need to think              |
| 52:13      | a little bit outside the box, but it can be great fun once you've, once you've escaped the box and      |
| 52:17      | now I'm just running around and there is no more boxes, just chocolate wrappers everywhere.             |
| 52:21      | Yeah. And then you have to build in a system to, you know, to make sure you run those. Well, I mean,    |
| 52:27      | one of the things I do with OmniFocus is I have lists, like I have a morning list and I have a          |
| 52:33      | shutdown list and I have a weekly, monthly and quarterly lists, and they just show up, you              |
| 52:38      | know, they're, they're repeat lists that show up and like I include stuff like that. And like,          |
| 52:43      | if I decide to add, you know, review completed projects to my daily routine, I will add that            |
| 52:51      | into the afternoon or the shutdown list and then every day that'll show up for me. I can even,          |
| 52:57      | if I want, put a link in the task to, to run the script so I can just run it from, from OmniFocus.      |
| 53:03      | And, and I really think that's another type of automation to give your, you know, to put that           |
| 53:08      | stuff in front of your face every day. And there's all sorts of apps we've talked about,                |
| 53:12      | you know, some of these automation friendly apps to, to give you a notice at certain time of day        |
| 53:17      | or whatnot. But for me, I just know every day I hit those lists in the morning, the afternoon.          |
| 53:22      | And, and I just, as I want to add stuff like this to my life, I will include them                       |
| 53:28      | where appropriate and then I see them every day.                                                        |
| 53:30      | Yeah. I think that makes a lot of sense. And one thing that I have experimented with a little           |
| 53:35      | bit with these routine type lists, like the ones that you've got, I have shortcuts for me to look       |
| 53:40      | at these lists. And then when I tap on that, that link or that shortcut, that it marks it as            |
| 53:47      | completed in streaks and opens that list in OmniFocus, in my case, for me, because streaks can be       |
| 53:54      | automated. It has great shortcuts integration. And if you, you run that, if you run your,               |
| 53:59      | your shortcut, then it can, you can do whatever you like. And in my case, these are just marked         |
| 54:04      | tasks as complete. Mark, have it as completed in streaks and open this URL to a specific OmniFocus      |
| 54:10      | perspective. Yeah. I, the way I handle it is different. I just have calendar entries. Like              |
| 54:15      | every day I have a time allotted in the afternoon to shut down and time a lot in the morning to         |
| 54:21      | start up. And, and those lists get, it's just, you know, I don't need to, I don't need a prompt         |
| 54:26      | because it's on my calendar. It's an appointment in essence to go through that. Yeah. But it's          |
| 54:31      | interesting to play with those too, because, and the, the automation technology in Dyson OmniFocus      |
| 54:38      | where this is, the project is called lists, but there's sub pro, there's sub tasks under there          |
| 54:45      | that have their own sub tasks, but it's, you know, the, the only ones that are set on a repeat formula  |
| 54:51      | are the title tasks, like when it'll be called the morning list, when it'll be called the shut          |
| 54:55      | down list, and then there's monthly quarterly, et cetera. Those, the master, the one called             |
| 55:02      | shut down list is a repeating task every day at four p.m. So OmniFocus knows once I click that          |
| 55:10      | everything underneath it gets marked as done, and then it sets it up to show up again tomorrow at four. |
| 55:16      | The mistake people make is they put the repeat formula on the sub tasks underneath it, like,            |
| 55:21      | you know, run my OmniFocus script to see my completed tasks, you know, do an email audit,               |
| 55:26      | you know, journal the day. And then you, that's the road to madness because suddenly you've got all     |
| 55:31      | these sub tasks that are repeating every day and they, they duplicate each other. It just turns         |
| 55:35      | into a mess. All the only thing you repeat is they actually, the master task. And there are days        |
| 55:41      | when I'll, I'll get through it and I'll check off a bunch. Some of the things I put in there,           |
| 55:45      | and we had Kurosh Dini recently unfocused to talk about the use of the word consider in a task,         |
| 55:50      | like one of the ones I have is consider gardening. Every morning it says consider gardening. I don't    |
| 55:55      | go out and garden every day, but every day I consider it, you know, but maybe I didn't check            |
| 56:01      | that off. But once I check off the morning routine task, all that stuff just disappears                 |
| 56:06      | from my list from the day. And anyway, maybe that was more than you wanted to hear. Sorry.              |
| 56:12      | Well, I find that that's, that's pretty useful. And I, the other thing that I specifically do           |
| 56:17      | with these kinds of lists, these routine lists is I use deferred dates and I don't use due dates.       |
| 56:22      | So that means that if I didn't do it yesterday, then okay, my night routine will show up in the         |
| 56:26      | morning in, in, in my OmniFocus, but that's okay. I'm okay with that. And I actually use projects       |
| 56:33      | for each of these. And I have them all in a folder, but you could do it whatever way you like.          |
| 56:40      | And I find that's pretty handy. And another tip, if you are using OmniFocus is you can have the         |
| 56:45      | project or task automatically complete when all of the actions inside of it are completed.              |
| 56:52      | So if you're going through checking things off and, you know, they're in a different perspective        |
| 56:55      | and you maybe don't necessarily see the project, then the project can, or the tasks,                    |
| 56:59      | parent tasks can automatically be marked as completed when you've done all of the,                      |
| 57:03      | the ones inside of it. But that's a lot of talk about review automation.                                |
| 57:09      | Yeah, there's a lot that you can automate and review. Now, all I need, as I said before,                |
| 57:13      | I need to feed my brain into an AI and that can automatically, you know, generate tasks                 |
| 57:17      | related to things in review and check things off because it knows what I've completed, right?           |
| 57:21      | That, that's how it works next.                                                                         |
| 57:23      | Just let the sub routine run at infinity.                                                               |
| 57:25      | Exactly. Yeah, exactly.                                                                                 |
| 57:27      | All right, but we've got more right after this.                                                         |

| 58:39      | So, Rose, let's talk about some stuff we've been automating lately. I wanted to do a check-in           |
| 58:45      | on my iPhone home screen. Well, my iPhone home screen is currently a bit of a mess,                     |
| 58:50      | so I'm very curious to see what is happening with yours. I sent you some pictures a while ago.          |
| 58:57      | This was before the Mandalorian came out just to be clear, but I've always liked Yoda and I had         |
| 59:02      | this cute little cartoon image of Yoda. And so I went ahead and decided that was going to be my         |
| 59:10      | home screen for a while. And then I wanted to make a shortcuts-based home screen that kind of           |
| 59:15      | followed that theme. And our friend [[Federico Viticci]] released a bunch of cool custom icons,            |
| 59:21      | and then Apple also has a really nice set of icons that now they ship with iOS 13 that you can          |
| 59:26      | access. So I built an entirely shortcuts-based home screen. And what I did was I pulled a colour         |
| 59:36      | green out of the Yoda image and used that as the background. So for each shortcut I make,               |
| 59:42      | I put that icon on top of the exact same colour green, and then I used that same colour for the           |
| 59:47      | background of my home screen. And I get a really kind of interesting looking home screen. And I'm       |
| 59:53      | going to, before this show publishes, I'm making a pledge right now. I'm going to make a YouTube video  |
| 59:59      | and put up how it works and how it looks so you can see it. So you can look at the video on the         |
| 01:00:03   | show notes. But it's just totally interesting. And everybody that sees my home screen either            |
| 01:00:09   | loves it or hates it. But it's, I thought, well, I'll just try it and see how long I can use it         |
| 01:00:16   | before I can't stand it anymore. And I've been using it now like four months, I think since about       |
| 01:00:22   | August. So it's really working out for me. That's good. I'm glad to hear that. I have a few shortcuts   |
| 01:00:33   | on my home screen. And they're primarily of the launcher variety, where it pops up with a menu          |
| 01:00:39   | of different shortcuts that I can run. But what I have been doing is I have gone back to lots and       |
| 01:00:45   | lots of folders on my home screen, and I'm using the widget. And one of the things that I'm really      |
| 01:00:51   | liking, LaunchCuts, which we mentioned earlier, has an action that you can add to your shortcuts.       |
| 01:00:58   | Or it's a shortcut that you can add to your shortcuts. But then it runs, essentially,                   |
| 01:01:04   | LaunchCuts inside of the shortcuts widget. Sounds crazy. But it means that what I can do is I can       |
| 01:01:10   | tap on this and it has all of the same folders that I have inside of LaunchCuts. And I'm really         |
| 01:01:16   | liking this because I'm going through and rearranging all of these things into these folders.           |
| 01:01:22   | And it means that I, you know, everything's there, and especially the smart folders,                    |
| 01:01:26   | really, really useful. And so that just automatically works. I'm very happy with that.                  |
| 01:01:33   | Yeah, Adam is a magician. I mean, that's all. And I really hope that he's able to continue to           |
| 01:01:39   | develop that app into the future. So I sent you a picture. I'm looking at it. And I can see why         |
| 01:01:46   | some people would hate it, because you can only just about if you kind of squint, see like the          |
| 01:01:52   | outline of the icons in the background. And then you've just got the white icon,                        |
| 01:01:56   | essentially, on the green background. Yeah, it's pretty cool. And then so each one is a shortcut.       |
| 01:02:02   | And, you know, I've always loved the idea of contextual based home screen. And like MacSparky           |
| 01:02:07   | is a lightning bolt. And if I tap on that, inside of it, I get a ton of options. I mean,                |
| 01:02:13   | we're talking earlier in the show about how I have a shortcut to create a new task for a blog post.     |
| 01:02:19   | Well, that shows up if I tap on that menu. But I also can go to the inbox in my MacSparky email        |
| 01:02:27   | with that, I can go to my RSS reader, I can, you know, go to Mac power users show preparation           |
| 01:02:33   | or the schedule, which is, you know, some of the stuff we store in Google. And so I've got all          |
| 01:02:38   | these weird things like I can go to specific air tables. And I just thought, well, everything I do      |
| 01:02:44   | on my phone related to MacSparky, what if I put it all under that button. And some of these things,    |
| 01:02:50   | if I just had an app on my screen to be easier to just tap the app, but they do more than that,         |
| 01:02:54   | like if I had the mail app on my home screen, it would open mail, but it wouldn't open mail             |
| 01:02:59   | to my MacSparky inbox. Instead, it would open to my everything else box. And I would see a bunch       |
| 01:03:04   | of stuff I don't want to look at and it would be distracting. So this is a way to kind of like          |
| 01:03:08   | zero in on exactly what you want. Next to it is a one, you know, the justice scales one. I think        |
| 01:03:14   | I got that one from [[Federico Viticci\|Federico's]] set. And I think that was actually a specific request I made of him      |
| 01:03:20   | when he was making it. I said, please give me some scales. So under that's all the legal stuff.         |
| 01:03:24   | And the same thing I can go to just the inbox and the legal thing, but I can also go into               |
| 01:03:29   | base camp or I can go into my billing program or a thing I use as a lawyer all the time is a date       |
| 01:03:35   | calculator, which is a shortcut I wrote that calculates dates. And so all that stuff is just            |
| 01:03:40   | under that button. And, you know, you always think about this in terms of efficiency, of course,        |
| 01:03:45   | automation, you know, how many taps does it take to get things. Quite often I get to things faster      |
| 01:03:52   | using this method. Occasionally, I get to things slower. But I really like the discipline of having     |
| 01:03:59   | different areas of my life contained within these icons. And I don't have any words on them.            |
| 01:04:05   | One of the nice things with the iOS 13 shortcuts is you can save a shortcut as an icon and you can      |
| 01:04:11   | remove the text just by hitting the little X next to it. You used to have to                            |
| 01:04:14   | put in an invisible string of text and it was super goofy. But now you can just remove the text         |
| 01:04:19   | when you create the icon. But I know what they are like, you know, the, like I said, the lightning      |
| 01:04:24   | bolt is max sparky, the icon of the camera gets me to not only my camera and photos app, but it         |
| 01:04:29   | also gets me to all my shortcuts photo based automation. And it's just an interesting way to            |
| 01:04:36   | run an iPhone. It's completely different than the usual app model. And like I said, I thought that I    |
| 01:04:44   | would probably get to a point where I couldn't take it anymore, or I wanted like a mix of apps and      |
| 01:04:49   | shortcuts. But after using this now for many months, I think this is going to stick for me.             |
| 01:04:55   | Well, I'm pleased to hear it because this is pretty good. And I've had an idea for mine. And I think    |
| 01:05:01   | I'm going to add some more shortcuts back to my home screen. What I don't like about this approach      |
| 01:05:06   | is there are no badges. And especially with some of the things in my life, I need to know that          |
| 01:05:12   | there's a badge. And for that, I'm pretty much using folders. And I travel the things related to        |
| 01:05:19   | that area in a folder. And then I can just tap and hold on that folder icon. And then I can see         |
| 01:05:24   | the different apps that are actually batched, which is pretty useful, because I can see, for            |
| 01:05:30   | example, that my email app for work has a badge, but it's all it's all in the work folder. And so       |
| 01:05:35   | I'm going to ignore that until 9am tomorrow. And if I tap and hold, then then I see specifically        |
| 01:05:41   | there's the email app that has the badge. But otherwise, I just know something related to               |
| 01:05:45   | work needs my attention. And then I can ignore things related to whether I need to.                     |
| 01:05:50   | So what I did with this is that I also have always had these four folders, you know, I call them        |
| 01:05:56   | create, was it create, learn, fix and play. And, and so all apps fit into one of those four             |
| 01:06:05   | categories for me. And then I put those on the second page. And they're at the top. And it's            |
| 01:06:08   | the same thing. I can swipe over and if I see badges off those folders, I can get to them the           |
| 01:06:12   | same way. The other thing I do is I'm testing apps constantly, you know, people tell me about an app    |
| 01:06:17   | I should try or something I may want to write about. And those apps are on the second screen            |
| 01:06:22   | below the folders, just so I'm reminded to try them. And I see them there. But largely, I just          |
| 01:06:27   | work off the screen. The other thing that's super important is the today view for this method,          |
| 01:06:33   | like, because I go over to the today view, it gets me to like my fantastic al data and my               |
| 01:06:38   | OmniFocus data and things like that. So it's important to me to be able to get to that data.           |
| 01:06:43   | But with the today view, you're just fine. The thing I don't like about this is occasionally            |
| 01:06:49   | shortcuts crashes on me, like I'll tap the button. And, and almost each one of these buttons is         |
| 01:06:56   | linked to a launcher type shortcut, you know, where it'll have, you know, choose from, from menu,       |
| 01:07:02   | and it'll be some of them will launch an app and some will be running a shortcut and                    |
| 01:07:06   | do all sorts of weird stuff. But occasionally just doesn't run, you tap it and nothing happens.         |
| 01:07:11   | And that happens to me like once a week. And then I go in, I force quit shortcuts,                      |
| 01:07:17   | and then I run it again, and it works. And I don't like that. Obviously, if you create this,            |
| 01:07:21   | and it doesn't work when you tap on it once a week, that may be enough to chase some people away.       |
| 01:07:26   | But it's, but it's just so delightful when it works. I seem to be sticking with it.                     |
| 01:07:33   | But it's been a fun automation exercise. And, and I continue to refine it, you know, every time I go,   |
| 01:07:39   | find myself going to dig out an app to do something, I just create a shortcut for that task             |
| 01:07:44   | and put it in contextually wherever it belongs in my life. And, and I'm finding this just to be         |
| 01:07:50   | a really nice way to use the phone. Now, if I decide I want to get off the Yoda screen and              |
| 01:07:57   | switch to something else, right, maybe I want to use the automators logo. The downside of this          |
| 01:08:02   | is I have to recreate the icons with whatever background colour I'm going to use for the next one.       |
| 01:08:07   | And so that's going to be something I don't do as often as I used to do. And, but I will do it at       |
| 01:08:13   | some point. And I am saving in the photos app galleries or, or collection albums on each set,           |
| 01:08:20   | so I can easily put it back if I want. Yeah, that makes sense. And I'm pretty certain because           |
| 01:08:27   | especially so you have some of the icons are from the Mac story set, right? And some of them are        |
| 01:08:31   | the San Francisco symbols, I guess. I'm pretty certain that you could set up some kind of automation    |
| 01:08:37   | because Toolbox Pro has that action to create a background or what was it? I'm forgetting the           |
| 01:08:45   | word. I used this in the [[Instagram]] shortcut that I linked in that last episode where it can create      |
| 01:08:50   | this colour block. Yeah. And, and so you could probably automate that relatively easily. Yeah,           |
| 01:08:58   | these icons are transparent. I should absolutely automate the process of going through. And then        |
| 01:09:03   | you can just input a colour at the start of your automation and have it create your entire icon          |
| 01:09:08   | set for you. Yeah, I think that's going to go on my little Apple note. That's going to happen. Yeah.    |
| 01:09:14   | And then the next time that you want to change your background, you can, you can set up that            |
| 01:09:17   | automation. And you're still going to have to go through and, you know, add the shortcuts to your       |
| 01:09:22   | home screen with the new colours. But, you know, it's one step less. Yeah. Or a couple of steps          |
| 01:09:28   | less, actually, because those icons are probably not the most fun to create. Yeah, no, I agree. But     |
| 01:09:34   | it is an interesting way to use an iPhone. And if you like automation and you built stuff in            |
| 01:09:39   | shortcuts, it gets you using your shortcuts more often. Oh, yeah. I'm probably going to go and          |
| 01:09:44   | add some more background. I'm probably not going to bother doing the matching background. My iPhone     |
| 01:09:48   | home screen actually at the moment is a black background with a rainbow border. And I really            |
| 01:09:52   | like that because when you, when you unlock your phone, you start with a completely back                |
| 01:09:56   | background and then this rainbow sort of like flushes in from the edges. It's really fun.               |
| 01:10:00   | Now on the iPad, I've done something different because of the iPad, you can show the today view         |
| 01:10:05   | all the time. I just use the shortcuts widget because it runs, does the same thing in the               |
| 01:10:11   | sidebar and that never crashes. It always works. And it's the same set of shortcuts.                    |
| 01:10:17   | They just combine them so that you all show up at the top. And I can still run them from                |
| 01:10:21   | the screen, but I don't install them as home screen icons. Fair enough. If you're like me,              |
| 01:10:28   | then you use your iPad very differently to the way you use your iPhone anyway. So it makes sense.       |
| 01:10:33   | Anyway, that's been fun and something I'm a continuing automation project for me.                       |
| 01:10:38   | Now I'm writing down an OmniFocus that to make this video. So I'll have it done by the time the         |
| 01:10:43   | show launches. Well, let's cross our fingers. One of the things that I have been experimenting with     |
| 01:10:49   | is back on the good old time tracking bandwagon and automating time tracking.                           |
| 01:10:55   | I recently upgraded my toggle plan to the starter plan so that I can have tasks inside                  |
| 01:11:00   | of projects because I realised that there's a whole bunch of things that I'm doing which are            |
| 01:11:05   | essentially like sub projects. And I was doing this with, you know, colons and project names            |
| 01:11:10   | and things like that. And it really didn't make a lot of sense. And I realised, you know, I can pay     |
| 01:11:16   | toggle. I'm, you know, getting a lot of value for money out of toggle. So I decided that I would        |
| 01:11:20   | upgrade to the starter plan and they have template projects. And this has been fun because then I've    |
| 01:11:26   | created, so for example, Screen Castle 9 has a template for every single show I do because every        |
| 01:11:32   | single show is a project and then there are different elements. So I have to do the preparation,        |
| 01:11:36   | the actual recording, the editing, you know, the other associated information that goes                 |
| 01:11:41   | with every show. And those four tasks happen for every single show. So when I create a show,            |
| 01:11:46   | I use a template now. And that's really nice. And then I've been playing some with Timery               |
| 01:11:53   | some more and creating some automations. So I've got one that finds all of the projects where           |
| 01:11:59   | Screen Castle Online is marked as my client. And that shows them to me as a list that I can choose      |
| 01:12:04   | from that when I'm when I'm working on things. So that I can say, yeah, I'm doing some Screen           |
| 01:12:09   | Castle Online work now and I have an NFC tag that runs this shortcut. And then it's like, okay,         |
| 01:12:13   | so which show are you doing? Great. Now, what are you doing for this show? Okay, good. Now,             |
| 01:12:18   | go do it. Here's your, here's your OmniFocus list of things related to that that you need to go and do. |
| 01:12:23   | That's been good fun. That was a bit of a challenge to get set up to start with,                        |
| 01:12:27   | but it's working now and it's working really nicely. And I'm tracking my time much more accurately.     |
| 01:12:32   | So what were the challenges and how did you overcome them?                                              |
| 01:12:35   | Well, the primary challenge was actually finding the time to sit down and do this                       |
| 01:12:39   | and figuring out, you know, what my template is going to be like. And then I had to play with           |
| 01:12:46   | Timery. And so my biggest problem was that my shortcuts were still not syncing properly between         |
| 01:12:52   | all of my devices. So I did the only logical thing, which was I uninstalled shortcuts on                |
| 01:12:58   | every single one of my devices and I reinstalled it. I did lose some shortcuts and I lost changes       |
| 01:13:03   | to some shortcuts and fairly significant changes in a couple of cases, but I did back everything        |
| 01:13:07   | up first. So as I'm finding things are missing, I've been able to fix that. And now that means          |
| 01:13:13   | that they actually work on all of my devices properly. So it doesn't matter how I run it.               |
| 01:13:18   | But for example, I had to play with the get tags action from Timery to figure out,                      |
| 01:13:25   | okay, so what does this give me back? And then I wanted to just find tags where I had SEO in            |
| 01:13:30   | the tag name. And it turns out the filter files action in shortcuts is really powerful. So this         |
| 01:13:36   | can do things like filter a list of text items, and it can sort things even randomly and so on.         |
| 01:13:42   | But you can also filter Timery tags or toggle tags that come from Timery and all sorts of things.       |
| 01:13:49   | So I was filtering from them and then you have to choose from list and pass it around.                  |
| 01:13:53   | But it's working pretty well now. It was just a bit of playing to get things done. And actually         |
| 01:13:58   | my end shortcut for this is pretty short. I'm very happy with it. I just needed to get everything       |
| 01:14:03   | set up the way needed to be set up. I had to smile when I saw that you did this because                 |
| 01:14:09   | I about every four or five months I go through and track my time for a couple of weeks just to          |
| 01:14:13   | kind of see as a checking. And so I'm, you know, my army focus told me to do that this week. So         |
| 01:14:19   | I started doing it again. But in the meantime, I had built this whole new home screen and I had         |
| 01:14:25   | removed all the Timery toggles because Timery has a great automation feature where you can turn a       |
| 01:14:32   | timer on or off as a shortcut action. So for instance, if I have a shortcut, this takes me to my        |
| 01:14:38   | MacSparky inbox, it could trigger the MacSparky email timer when I run that and then take me to       |
| 01:14:45   | the inbox and then that would automate the process. But I had taken them out because I wasn't really    |
| 01:14:50   | running Timery. And now I'm like weighing the, do I go back and re add that stuff into all my           |
| 01:14:56   | automation or do it because the Timery, like I sent Rose my home screen, I've got Timery on my,         |
| 01:15:01   | on my dock now, because I just been going in manually throwing the switches through the process         |
| 01:15:06   | for the day. And as an automator, you know, how can I do that? Right. So do I go back and add them      |
| 01:15:11   | in? I think I probably will and just leave them in there and just realise they're sometimes when        |
| 01:15:17   | I'm more careful about the data than others. Yeah. Well, one of the things I've been experimenting      |
| 01:15:22   | with, there's a great app by [[Simon Støvring]], the creator of Scriptable and JSON. It's called Data      |
| 01:15:28   | Jar. It's only in beta at the moment, but the idea is it's a database that you have on your device,     |
| 01:15:32   | and you can save variables and stuff to it. So it's kind of like the global variables in                |
| 01:15:37   | Toolbox Pro. But one of the things I've been experimenting with is shortcuts variables,                 |
| 01:15:43   | specifically like meta variables. So should I run the, I've got a complex work time tracking            |
| 01:15:51   | shortcut, which pulls data from weird files at work and stuff like that to present me with options.     |
| 01:15:58   | And I have options in there to, to ask, to determine whether or not these should be run. So             |
| 01:16:05   | like for example, your time tracking, should your time tracking be run or not run? And so,              |
| 01:16:10   | well, it would be a little bit more work to set up in the first place. You could theoretically get      |
| 01:16:15   | maybe a global variable from Toolbox Pro or get data out of [[Data Jar]]. And it should say, hey,           |
| 01:16:20   | should I run time tracking? If yes, then run the time reaction. And then just delete your otherwise.    |
| 01:16:27   | And then you can turn time tracking on and off globally and have it in all of your                      |
| 01:16:33   | shortcuts or none of your shortcuts, but you don't have to edit your shortcut every single time.        |
| 01:16:37   | Or I could just, you know, run it all the time. Those are both options. This started with,              |
| 01:16:44   | because I was, I was finding that I was running into this, what happens when you run developer          |
| 01:16:49   | pages, you know, immediately after they've been released, and it's a brand new operating system,        |
| 01:16:54   | where the turn Wi-Fi off and turn Wi-Fi on actions were crashing shortcuts.                             |
| 01:16:59   | And one of the things, when I leave work and I clock in and clock out,                                  |
| 01:17:04   | the place where I do that, the Wi-Fi is a little bit iffy. So it's strong enough that my phone's        |
| 01:17:11   | there and it's going, yeah, I've got Wi-Fi, but it's poor enough that actually connecting to our        |
| 01:17:16   | clock in and clock out does not work. And so I usually toggle the Wi-Fi off and then turn it            |
| 01:17:22   | back on at the end of my shortcut. And this is also helpful if we've had a network outage               |
| 01:17:25   | during the day, and I've done the swipe down from the control centre and toggle Wi-Fi off               |
| 01:17:29   | until the end of the day. Then when I go home, I will, because it turns Wi-Fi off, off,                 |
| 01:17:34   | and then turns it on, on instead of just saying, don't connect to anything for the next                 |
| 01:17:39   | x period of time. Then it actually, it means that I'll be connected to my home network                  |
| 01:17:43   | properly when I get home, which is really nice. I have to give that a 10 out of 10,                     |
| 01:17:47   | but that was crashing shortcuts. And that was problematic to say the least,                             |
| 01:17:52   | because it meant I couldn't clock in and clock out because I'd start running the shortcut and it        |
| 01:17:56   | would crash. And so I started wrapping these things and I realised that, okay, so I'm checking          |
| 01:18:01   | whether or not I should be turning the Wi-Fi on and off, and then something else was                    |
| 01:18:05   | not working, the time tracking at work, our servers changed and various things happened.                |
| 01:18:10   | So I didn't want to be running that for the time being. So that was another variable,                   |
| 01:18:14   | and I had them all stored at the top of the shortcut, but then I had other shortcuts that I             |
| 01:18:17   | needed to access these same things in. And that's when I started using [[Data Jar]] to store these meta       |
| 01:18:23   | variables for whether or not sections of my shortcuts should run, especially sections that              |
| 01:18:29   | are in multiple shortcuts. Yeah, that's a great idea, that app. But time, I guess the short             |
| 01:18:35   | version of this is, if you want to do time tracking with Toggle, get Timery and just pay for the        |
| 01:18:39   | subscription, because the way to automate this used to require very complicated URL actions,            |
| 01:18:46   | and now it's a one-step shortcut, and it's actively developed. And it's a good app, and the             |
| 01:18:53   | developer was at our meet up last year at WWCA, super nice guy, and he solved the problem for a          |
| 01:18:59   | lot of us with this app. Definitely. And I have to say, this is something I noticed when I signed       |
| 01:19:05   | up for the Toggle start-up plan. So Toggle has the free plan, which most people I'm sure use,           |
| 01:19:11   | and the start-up plan and a professional plan. Once I signed up to the start-up plan, I realised        |
| 01:19:15   | that Timery donated a bunch more actions to shortcuts, because there are a bunch of things              |
| 01:19:20   | that are available to me that weren't available before. So, for example, tasks is something             |
| 01:19:24   | that is available for people who are on the paid Toggle plans, but isn't available on the free plan.    |
| 01:19:30   | Well, I now have that, and that's really useful. Nice. All right, Rose. Well, we covered the beginning  |
| 01:19:39   | and ending of task management today, capture and review, and we both had some interesting               |
| 01:19:44   | problems resolved. Yeah, we had that. I'd call it a pretty good episode of The Automators.              |
| 01:19:49   | I think so too. We are The Automators. You can find us over at relay.fm/automators. You           |
| 01:19:55   | can also find the forum over at talk.automators.fm, very active community there. One of the things      |
| 01:20:01   | Rose has done with that that I love is she's invited a bunch of these automation-themed                 |
| 01:20:06   | developers and to put their forums on our forum. And so it's kind of a central hub,                     |
| 01:20:12   | and we're getting lots of people showing up for that stuff, and it's just become a great                |
| 01:20:16   | resource on the internet. And Rose gets all the credit. She did all the work on that, so I'm so         |
| 01:20:22   | happy. Well, I have to say, I do kind of feel like the developers themselves did most of the work,      |
| 01:20:27   | [[Adam Tow]], making [[LaunchCuts]], and [[Simon Støvring]] making [[Scriptable]], and [[Alex Hay]] making                |
| 01:20:33   | [[Toolbox Pro]]. They did all the work behind this, and they just get the benefit of having a little        |
| 01:20:37   | area of our forum. So if you want to talk about [[Pushcut]] by [[Simon Leeb\|Simon]] or any of these, then you can         |
| 01:20:45   | jump into our forums and jump straight into those sections. And it's just such a great                  |
| 01:20:49   | community because on the podcast, it's really hard to, and we try to slow down and talk through         |
| 01:20:55   | the challenging parts or the steps we take on some of these automations, but on the forum,              |
| 01:20:59   | people can actually post the scripts and you can see them. So just if you like the show,                |
| 01:21:03   | go sign up for the forum and check it out. Yes. Also, thanks to our sponsors,                           |
| 01:21:08   | Pingdom ExpressVPN and Kensington, and we'll see you in a few weeks.                                   |
