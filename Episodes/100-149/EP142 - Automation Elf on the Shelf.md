| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Welcome to the Automators, a podcast where we teach you how to turn your computers and              |
| 00:07      | technology into automation machines that work for you.                                              |
| 00:10      | Don't we all want robots?                                                                           |
| 00:12      | I do.                                                                                               |
| 00:13      | I'm David Sparks and I'm joined by Rosemary Orchard.                                                |
| 00:15      | How are you today, Rosemary?                                                                        |
| 00:17      | I'm excited, David.                                                                                 |
| 00:19      | It's that time of year.                                                                             |
| 00:20      | I'm getting comfy and cozy with blankets and all of those lovely LED candles and stuff              |
| 00:26      | because I will forget real candles and LED candles are safe.                                        |
| 00:29      | But yeah, and I figured it might be fun to talk about some of that stuff today.                     |
| 00:34      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 00:35      | I mean, well, they're not really the same though, right?                                            |
| 00:37      | They don't have the smell.                                                                          |
| 00:38      | No, but I kind of figured that's a good thing because, yeah, I mean, I guess I can start            |
| 00:45      | straight out with one little automation that I've got running.                                      |
| 00:48      | So I don't use candles or wax burners or anything because I live in a fairly small flat.            |
| 00:53      | So I do have to be careful about making sure that there's enough oxygen around, like opening        |
| 00:58      | windows on a regular basis so that I get rid of carbon dioxide and get the oxygen in.               |
| 01:05      | But one of the...                                                                                   |
| 01:06      | So I don't use candles.                                                                             |
| 01:07      | I don't use wax burners, but I do like having a little bit of scent from something like             |
| 01:12      | an air freshener.                                                                                   |
| 01:13      | However, those plug-in air fresheners stay plugged in all the time.                                 |
| 01:17      | I find if they stay plugged in forever, they give me a bit of a migraine, which is not              |
| 01:21      | great.                                                                                              |
| 01:22      | It's just some of the scents and it's not always...                                                 |
| 01:24      | It's not a guaranteed trigger, but that's problematic.                                              |
| 01:29      | And also it becomes overwhelming and you become blind to it.                                        |
| 01:32      | So what I've done is very simple and it's going to kind of lead into another holiday                |
| 01:39      | automation.                                                                                         |
| 01:40      | I have things like a plug-in air freshener on a smart plug.                                         |
| 01:44      | And what happens is they turn on for about five minutes when I get home and then five               |
| 01:48      | minutes a couple of times a day while somebody's at home.                                           |
| 01:51      | So you get a nice little bit of scent of cinnamon things or something like that without             |
| 01:57      | it being overwhelming on your house when somebody steps into it being like, I got breathed because  |
| 02:02      | I know whenever I go to visit my grandmothers, I get stuffy, my dad gets stuffy, my mom gets        |
| 02:07      | stuffy and all of us feel like we have a slightly scratchy throat and it's because she's got        |
| 02:11      | three or four of those plug-in air fresheners in one room, which is just way too much.              |
| 02:16      | But yeah, so I have some of those nicer plug-in air fresheners on a smart plug.                     |
| 02:21      | And as a bonus, they last longer because they're not plugged in all the time.                       |
| 02:24      | So yeah, so nice little tip for folks there.                                                        |
| 02:29      | I think one of the things people have forgotten is that smart plugs now are ridiculously cheap      |
| 02:36      | and [[Matter]], [[HomeKit]], whatever you want, you can get them for very little money.                    |
| 02:42      | And that does open a lot of options, right?                                                         |
| 02:45      | To do something like this, or like if you just want to kick the router once in a while              |
| 02:49      | and turn it off and on without having to reach under and plug it, all those things now are          |
| 02:53      | accessible with a reasonably priced smart plug.                                                     |
| 02:57      | Yes.                                                                                                |
| 02:58      | Though I will say if you are going to put your router or modem on a smart plug, you're              |
| 03:03      | going to need to use a network that is not Wi-Fi based because if you use a Wi-Fi based             |
| 03:08      | network to turn off the smart plug that your router is plugged into, how are you going              |
| 03:13      | to turn it back on?                                                                                 |
| 03:16      | This question that I'll let you all answer at home, connect the dots.                               |
| 03:21      | I see some of you are going, uh-huh, uh-huh, I got it, I got it, I got it.                          |
| 03:25      | So yeah, use, if you're going to do that, a Zigbee one or something that can remember               |
| 03:29      | the time and power itself back on after like a minute or something like that.                       |
| 03:34      | Personally I don't do that, I don't have those on a smart plug.                                     |
| 03:37      | I have them on a UPS, actually the UPS is connected to a smart plug, but that's only                |
| 03:41      | because I'm measuring how much energy it uses because I have some energy monitoring smart           |
| 03:46      | plugs and those are the ones that are programmed where if they ever get turned off, turn them       |
| 03:51      | back on immediately.                                                                                |
| 03:53      | Well either way, kitchen appliances, whatever, things that you want to be able to turn off          |
| 03:58      | and on remotely, it's a lot easier to do than it used to be and that stuff is really reliable.      |
| 04:05      | So that's a nice way to start autonomy.                                                             |
| 04:08      | I didn't think we'd get into it that fast, but hey, there we go.                                    |
| 04:12      | Yeah, I mean, it's one of those things where we end up, I just end up having these little           |
| 04:17      | ideas based on something you say and off we go.                                                     |
| 04:20      | That's the show, baby, that's the show.                                                             |
| 04:23      | Anyway, as we said, we are the automators and it's that time of year, we thought it would           |
| 04:27      | be fun to talk about a holiday automation.                                                          |
| 04:32      | We've done it before, but we evolve, there's new technology, there's new stuff out there,           |
| 04:36      | so we've got a bunch of stuff to talk to.                                                           |
| 04:38      | And then we've also got a show called Automators Max and for Automators Max subscribers, you        |
| 04:43      | get this show ad free with some extended content and for Automators Max, we're going to extend      |
| 04:48      | the holiday love with a 3D printed holiday.                                                         |
| 04:52      | We're going to be talking about 3D printers and holidays because that is something that             |
| 04:55      | both Rose and I are very interested in these days.                                                  |
| 04:58      | So where do we start, Rose, talking about the holidays?                                             |
| 05:02      | Well, I think we should probably continue where I sort of dragged us in at the beginning            |
| 05:07      | of the show with some smart plugs because smart plugs are fabulous for a whole bunch                |
| 05:12      | of holiday automation things.                                                                       |
| 05:15      | And I'm specifically talking like home things.                                                      |
| 05:18      | So obviously I mentioned the air fresheners before, but this is the sort of time of year            |
| 05:23      | where over here in the UK, we tend to have a humidity problem in our homes where it gets            |
| 05:26      | too humid.                                                                                          |
| 05:27      | Where I previously lived in Vienna, we had the opposite problem, it was very, very dry              |
| 05:32      | inside where the humidity was low enough that we had to run humidifiers.                            |
| 05:37      | Here in the UK, I run a dehumidifier, but a dehumidifier or humidifier is great, but                |
| 05:43      | it can be kind of noisy and you don't necessarily need it running all the time.                     |
| 05:49      | So if you've got one of those or you're looking to get one of those, I recommend looking for        |
| 05:54      | a really dumb one.                                                                                  |
| 05:55      | Like the dumbest box of bricks version of the humidifier or a dehumidifier that you                 |
| 05:59      | can get with like a physical on off switch on it.                                                   |
| 06:03      | Not one of those where you press a button and it turns on and you select a mode, just               |
| 06:07      | like a physical clicking on off the one zero switch, because then you can just leave it             |
| 06:12      | on and throw it on a smart plug and have it turn on and off automatically.                          |
| 06:15      | So you know, when you start a meeting and you hit your meeting button on your computer,             |
| 06:20      | like the dehumidifier or the humidifier in your office or fan heater or something like              |
| 06:24      | that can just turn off.                                                                             |
| 06:26      | And so that you don't have that sound going, but you can turn it back on if you need to.            |
| 06:31      | And so that's another way I'd use a smart plug this holiday season or this wintery season           |
| 06:37      | or summery season, if you're in Australia, this may not be so relevant in Australia,                |
| 06:41      | but you know, save it for the summer or winter in your case.                                        |
| 06:45      | It is interesting that you hadn't, when you think about it, using the smart plugs that              |
| 06:49      | are not expensive, you can take a dumb thing and make it smart.                                     |
| 06:54      | In fact, sometimes the dumber the better, like I was thinking some of our like heating              |
| 06:59      | blankets in our house, like they require you to physically turn them on, they automatically         |
| 07:02      | turn off.                                                                                           |
| 07:03      | There's logic in there.                                                                             |
| 07:05      | If you just plug it in, it's actually not going to turn on.                                         |
| 07:07      | You've got to go over and push the button on it.                                                    |
| 07:11      | And in this case, one that would just work when you plug it in connected with a smart               |
| 07:15      | plug is actually a lot more useful.                                                                 |
| 07:19      | So speaking of like heating blankets or heating pads or something, I have a couple of those         |
| 07:23      | because they're a really great low cost way of keeping one person warm.                             |
| 07:27      | Instead of having to heat like a whole big room or a whole big house, you know, it makes            |
| 07:31      | a low sense to just heat one person, especially if you're sitting at home working.                  |
| 07:36      | You don't need the room to be, you know, incredibly toasty warm, you need yourself to be warm       |
| 07:40      | and comfortable and the room to be an acceptable temperature to work in.                            |
| 07:44      | And so I use heating pads and I have some of those ones with the physical clicking sliders          |
| 07:49      | on them.                                                                                            |
| 07:50      | So, you know, they rush it up, they rush it down, etc.                                              |
| 07:54      | And those are great because I can have them on a smart plug and when I turn the smart               |
| 07:57      | plug on, they turn on.                                                                              |
| 07:59      | But the real reason why I've got them on a smart plug is because I can check when the               |
| 08:03      | room is not occupied and turn off the plug.                                                         |
| 08:06      | When I leave the house, I turn off the plug.                                                        |
| 08:08      | When I hit the button by my bed that says I'm going to sleep, it turns off the plug.                |
| 08:12      | So I know that those are definitely going to be turned off automatically.                           |
| 08:16      | They also do have the automatic safety cutoff in them.                                              |
| 08:19      | So when they've been on about 40 minutes, they'll turn off.                                         |
| 08:22      | And yeah, I find that, you know, having smart plugs on the end of things, especially I know         |
| 08:28      | some folks run, you know, like a plug-in heater of some kind because that way it's, you know,       |
| 08:34      | they can just heat the one room instead of having to turn on the heating for the whole              |
| 08:37      | house, which is a great idea, but making sure that it's definitely turned off is something          |
| 08:42      | that you're going to want to do.                                                                    |
| 08:44      | So I personally am all in favor of throw it on a smart plug.                                        |
| 08:49      | And then when you leave the house, just turn off all the things like that and you should            |
| 08:52      | be good to go.                                                                                      |
| 08:54      | Agreed.                                                                                             |
| 08:55      | Agreed.                                                                                             |
| 08:56      | And that's part of winter, I guess, in the Northern Hemisphere, at least, holiday automation.       |
| 09:01      | Always feels like it involves winter because, you know, we both grew up here.                       |
| 09:05      | I mean, if you're in Australia, turn off the fans when you leave the house, you know, save          |
| 09:09      | the environment, things like that, you know, if you have Aircon, then yeah, you can turn            |
| 09:14      | off the Aircon.                                                                                     |
| 09:15      | It might even be worth looking into, you know, a lot of folks have got Aircon with like a           |
| 09:20      | remote control that you can control via an IR blaster.                                              |
| 09:25      | So something that doesn't have home kit support, I'm going to completely forget the name of         |
| 09:30      | it now.                                                                                             |
| 09:31      | But it does have an app and it can learn.                                                           |
| 09:35      | I'm not thinking of the Logitech Harmony.                                                           |
| 09:37      | That was a great one.                                                                               |
| 09:40      | I have to pour one out.                                                                             |
| 09:41      | I'm going to miss that.                                                                             |
| 09:42      | That was a great device.                                                                            |
| 09:43      | I mean, I still have mine.                                                                          |
| 09:45      | It still works.                                                                                     |
| 09:46      | Logitech say they're going to keep it going.                                                        |
| 09:48      | So you know, that's great.                                                                          |
| 09:50      | But yeah, I don't know how long that's actually going to keep going.                                |
| 09:55      | But there is an alternative one.                                                                    |
| 09:58      | I've got one in my kitchen.                                                                         |
| 09:59      | I can't think of the name of it right now, so I'll find the name and I'll stick a link              |
| 10:06      | in the show notes.                                                                                  |
| 10:07      | But it is like it's a small black box and you can point your remote control at it and               |
| 10:11      | teach it commands and then it will re-broadcast those commands.                                     |
| 10:14      | But it can do it over Wi-Fi.                                                                        |
| 10:16      | It'll actually just make whatever it is into a Wi-Fi control device.                                |
| 10:20      | So my kitchen TV, which is as dumb as a box of rocks, except it's actually dumber because           |
| 10:24      | it thinks it's slightly larger than it is, so stuff is constantly slightly off the edges            |
| 10:28      | of the screen.                                                                                      |
| 10:29      | Yeah, I can control that via this little smart device.                                              |
| 10:33      | So I've got it linked into my Chromecast now, which is really cool.                                 |
| 10:37      | So when I turn my Chromecast on, the TV turns on, et cetera.                                        |
| 10:40      | So I've just managed to double check and it is the broad link IR blaster.                           |
| 10:44      | And yeah, so they don't work with [[HomeKit]], unfortunately, or at least not yet.                      |
| 10:48      | Maybe at some point they'll add master support and then we can use them in [[HomeKit]].                 |
| 10:54      | But as it is, it's great for learning, like I've got this fan heater that's got a remote            |
| 11:01      | control for it or an aircon unit or a whole home heating unit that's got one of those               |
| 11:07      | remote controls that sends out an IR blast of some kind.                                            |
| 11:11      | And it will work with that over Wi-Fi.                                                              |
| 11:14      | It doesn't work with [[HomeKit]], so you'll have to use its app or something like [[Home Assistant]]        |
| 11:18      | or similar, which I'm using it with, but it works really well.                                      |
| 11:23      | Yeah, you know, this is a really good idea.                                                         |
| 11:25      | And I wish that it did support [[HomeKit]] because it just feels to me like an obvious, you know,       |
| 11:33      | kind of thing that we would like for easy [[HomeKit]] automation.                                       |
| 11:36      | And there's nothing there yet.                                                                      |
| 11:38      | Well, I get why it doesn't because it can be very difficult.                                        |
| 11:42      | [[HomeKit\|HomeKit's]] quite picky about things like adding a TV or adding a fan or something.                   |
| 11:47      | And if something declares itself as a hub and then it adds like a TV and a fan and so               |
| 11:52      | on, it needs to have like the full specifications of all of those things like saved so it can       |
| 11:57      | add that to [[HomeKit]] and that can be kind of tricky.                                                 |
| 12:01      | So I get why it doesn't, but yeah, there's the broad link.                                          |
| 12:05      | I've got the mini version that works just great on my kitchen TV.                                   |
| 12:10      | So yeah, and it's worked great on some fans and other things I've tried it out with too.            |
| 12:16      | Is the app any good?                                                                                |
| 12:17      | It's fine.                                                                                          |
| 12:18      | It's not the nicest app in the world.                                                               |
| 12:20      | It's not the worst app in the world.                                                                |
| 12:21      | It works, which is basically all I can ever ask from these things, you know, it's one               |
| 12:27      | of those where they've definitely written it.                                                       |
| 12:29      | So it's an Android app that happens to work on iPhone rather than it being a dedicated              |
| 12:34      | iPhone first app.                                                                                   |
| 12:35      | Sure.                                                                                               |
| 12:36      | It's fine.                                                                                          |
| 12:37      | And yeah, it controls my kitchen TV and I personally barely interact with the app anyway now.       |
| 12:43      | So that's a bonus for me.                                                                           |
| 12:44      | I wonder if I could get one of these and program my ceiling fan radio commands into it, you         |
| 12:49      | know, because my ceiling fan has a remote and that would be kind of fun.                            |
| 12:54      | It's worth giving it a try.                                                                         |
| 12:55      | They're like $16 on Amazon on Black Friday sale right now.                                          |
| 12:59      | So hopefully there will still be some of those sales going on when this episode releases            |
| 13:03      | and folks can take advantage of that.                                                               |
| 13:06      | And they have a couple of different ones too.                                                       |
| 13:08      | So they have the Broadcom RM4 Pro, which is much more expensive.                                    |
| 13:13      | It's like $40.                                                                                      |
| 13:16      | And then they have the standard one.                                                                |
| 13:17      | What's the difference?                                                                              |
| 13:18      | And did you look into it?                                                                           |
| 13:21      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 13:22      | So there, I can't remember precisely exactly what the differences are, but I think the              |
| 13:28      | pro one does IR as well as RF and the mini ones just do like RF commands instead.                   |
| 13:38      | And obviously the mini ones are smaller.                                                            |
| 13:40      | This thing is truly absolutely tiny.                                                                |
| 13:43      | Like I've just stuck it.                                                                            |
| 13:44      | I found actually the best place to stick it ironically, because my TV in the kitchen,               |
| 13:47      | it's built into the front of all the cabinets.                                                      |
| 13:49      | So I've lost a couple of inches of depth out of one of those cabinets, which is really              |
| 13:53      | annoying.                                                                                           |
| 13:54      | And I honestly, I don't really need a TV in my kitchen, but it is nice to turn on when              |
| 13:58      | I'm doing a bunch of cooking or something.                                                          |
| 14:01      | And so I found the best place to stick it is actually directly underneath the TV.                   |
| 14:06      | And then it works perfectly to control that.                                                        |
| 14:09      | But it's maybe an inch and a half tall or something.                                                |
| 14:14      | It's teeny, teeny tiny, which is truly great.                                                       |
| 14:16      | What kind of range do you get on it?                                                                |
| 14:19      | So I found it didn't work great from the opposite side of my kitchen.                               |
| 14:22      | And my kitchen is very narrow, but I'm blaming that 100 percent.                                    |
| 14:27      | And I do mean 100 percent on the TV, not the actual device, because that TV is weird in             |
| 14:36      | so many ways.                                                                                       |
| 14:38      | You know, I've got a reasonably sized bedroom and I had it set up in there for a while to           |
| 14:43      | control my bedroom fan.                                                                             |
| 14:45      | And so it was a good three meters away from it and a meter and a half higher than the               |
| 14:53      | receiving point on the fan.                                                                         |
| 14:56      | And so a meter is three foot, so I was 10 feet away, plus five feet up in the air, I                |
| 15:06      | guess.                                                                                              |
| 15:07      | I don't know.                                                                                       |
| 15:08      | I'm not very good at translating these things, but I'm guesstimating, but I was approximately       |
| 15:11      | that far away and it worked absolutely great 100 percent of the time on this fan.                   |
| 15:15      | So yeah, definitely worth looking into.                                                             |
| 15:19      | My questions were not purely academic for the listeners.                                            |
| 15:21      | I have now got one of my cart, but because I'm doing a podcast with the Rosemary Orchard,           |
| 15:25      | I'm not going to check out just yet because I feel like you never know, right?                      |
| 15:30      | You just never know what she's going to lean you down.                                              |
| 15:32      | But yeah, this will be cool.                                                                        |
| 15:34      | I thought it would be fun just to be able to do that.                                               |
| 15:37      | It's too bad.                                                                                       |
| 15:38      | I can't automate it through shortcuts, but let me take a look at it.                                |
| 15:43      | Maybe I can get this thing hooked up to [[Home Assistant]] and then I could work through that.          |
| 15:46      | I'll check it out.                                                                                  |
| 15:48      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 15:49      | Well, I mean, I feel like we should give some folks some recommendations for smart plugs,           |
| 15:52      | things we've just talked about, a bunch of smart plug stuff as well.                                |
| 15:55      | And so, you know, I'm obviously going to suggest huge smart plugs if you've already got a huge      |
| 16:01      | hub.                                                                                                |
| 16:02      | So, plugs are more expensive, but they are great and they are reliable and they work.               |
| 16:10      | IKEA Trad Free is another great option, which is very affordable.                                   |
| 16:13      | They're a bit larger physically, but they are fabulous for things like this.                        |
| 16:18      | And then if you don't have a hub at all and you just want to buy like one smart plug to             |
| 16:23      | try this thing out, then I'd recommend Merrill's M-E-R-O-S.                                         |
| 16:28      | You can get those on Amazon.                                                                        |
| 16:30      | Make sure to get the ones that work with [[HomeKit]] or [[Matter]], not the ones that don't work with       |
| 16:34      | [[HomeKit]] or Matter.                                                                                  |
| 16:35      | And those are the work of a Wi-Fi.                                                                  |
| 16:38      | I don't love Wi-Fi devices, but if you need something like a four-gang extension or, you            |
| 16:45      | know, you just want to try one smart plug, then those are very affordable to give it                |
| 16:50      | a go.                                                                                               |
| 16:51      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 16:52      | I have been buying the Aqara stuff.                                                                 |
| 16:53      | I'm so in the bag for them at this point and their smart plugs are good.                            |
| 16:58      | Another thing I would recommend, since we're kind of in that neighbourhood and we're talking         |
| 17:02      | about the holidays, is on your advice, about three or four years ago, I bought a [[HomeKit]]            |
| 17:09      | enabled smart power strip where you can address each of the plugs on it.                            |
| 17:15      | And we use that every holiday.                                                                      |
| 17:18      | It's so useful because we're a typical Christmas nut family.                                        |
| 17:24      | We've got the village.                                                                              |
| 17:25      | We've got the tree.                                                                                 |
| 17:26      | My wife has an additional tree.                                                                     |
| 17:28      | So it's like, I like to be able to address power to each individual unit.                           |
| 17:33      | I don't even remember what brand I bought it from.                                                  |
| 17:35      | I don't have it in front of me, but there's a lot of rep, you know, get one of the reputable        |
| 17:39      | [[HomeKit]] brands, but the power strip is actually quite useful.                                       |
| 17:43      | The one I got also has USB ports on the end, which are also addressable.                            |
| 17:48      | So you can turn each off and on through [[HomeKit]] if you just want to stay with [[HomeKit]].              |
| 17:53      | It's also, of course, available on Home.                                                            |
| 17:55      | This isn't anything that works in [[HomeKit]] works everywhere else because [[HomeKit]] is                  |
| 17:58      | the hardest, you know, the highest hurdle, but a power strip with plugs is really good.             |
| 18:03      | Are you getting any recommendations for that?                                                       |
| 18:06      | I mean, I have Meross ones or rather I gave my Meross one to my parents because I managed             |
| 18:13      | to get a hold of a TP-Link one, but I am not actually going to recommend the TP-Link                |
| 18:17      | ones because TP-Link changed how they're doing things and if you buy one now or you                 |
| 18:23      | update yours, then it doesn't have local control anymore, which absolutely sucks.                   |
| 18:29      | So yeah, I've gone with the old TP-Link, which is not updated and I blocked their update            |
| 18:36      | server, so it's not allowed to talk to the update servers anymore, but yeah, Meross is               |
| 18:42      | the one that I had originally and my parents now have it and it's working absolutely fabulously     |
| 18:47      | for them.                                                                                           |
| 18:48      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 18:49      | I'm looking at my purchase history.                                                                 |
| 18:50      | Meross is the one I bought as well and just great, just great, you know, and if you do               |
| 18:55      | a lot of holiday decorations, being able to like turn on one set of lights but not the              |
| 19:00      | other via [[HomeKit]] is super useful and even if I don't use it all year, I feel like I                |
| 19:06      | get my money's worth out of it.                                                                     |
| 19:08      | Yeah, and the USB ports on the end are a really nice addition.                                      |
| 19:12      | I have, in my office, I have set up some various holiday lighting things.                           |
| 19:20      | So I have a mini little Christmas tree and I have some snowflakes which plug in via USB             |
| 19:27      | and so I have those, those are actually just plugged into one of those USB multi-chargers,          |
| 19:33      | which is all smart plug, but I am looking at moving those over to either an extension               |
| 19:39      | cable with smart USB ports on the end or something else, which I'm still investigating, but Sonoff  |
| 19:47      | do smart USB controllers, like it plugs in between the USB, like you plug the device                |
| 19:54      | into that and then you plug that into USB port and then it's got Wi-Fi to turn things               |
| 19:58      | on and off, which is pretty cool.                                                                   |
| 20:00      | Yeah, and I guess since we're covering power now, I want to talk about one more and that            |
| 20:06      | is outdoor [[HomeKit]] enabled powers and these were terrible for the longest time.                     |
| 20:14      | I bought and returned several of these over the years and I had really bad experiences              |
| 20:21      | with them, frankly, but I got a Merosss one a couple years ago and I have beat the hell               |
| 20:27      | out of this thing.                                                                                  |
| 20:28      | I leave it outside too often, I'm just terrible to it and it works and it works reliably and        |
| 20:35      | if you're putting outdoor lighting up, having an outdoor [[HomeKit]] switch is really cool.             |

| 22:09      | You're listening to the Automator's podcast.                                                        |
| 22:10      | There's a good chance that you could do a lot of your own IT work.                                  |
| 22:15      | But that's not the question you should be asking yourself.                                          |
| 22:17      | The question should be, should you be doing your own IT work?                                       |
| 22:20      | And the answer of your running a business is absolutely not.                                        |
| 22:24      | There are too many more important things to do.                                                     |

| 23:02      | So David, I know that you have a fabulous Christmas playlist that you curate and you                |
| 23:10      | share with everybody via [[Apple Music]], but what are you doing with the automation around             |
| 23:15      | this playlist?                                                                                      |
| 23:16      | Yeah, I like automating holiday music.                                                              |
| 23:18      | It's just fun, right?                                                                               |
| 23:20      | If you want to play holiday music, get yourself in the mood.                                        |
| 23:24      | My playlist, it just depends on your taste.                                                         |
| 23:26      | It's very heavily jazz-influenced, so some people like that, some people don't.                     |
| 23:32      | My wife, the other night, I was playing it, and she's like, oh, this sounds like one of             |
| 23:36      | the songs on the Hallmark channel.                                                                  |
| 23:38      | And it was George Shearing, and I was incredibly offended, you know, so I guess it just depends     |
| 23:43      | on your taste.                                                                                      |
| 23:44      | But yeah, so I have a Yule playlist.                                                                |
| 23:46      | I'll put a link in the show notes if you want to check it out.                                      |
| 23:48      | But every year I add a few, take a few off, and it's just, you know, it's my holiday playlist.      |
| 23:54      | I call it Yule, you know, because that's cool.                                                      |
| 23:56      | Yule.                                                                                               |
| 23:57      | But I do like to automate it, and there's a couple of ways you can do it.                           |
| 24:02      | I'm trying to keep it simple, and this is one that absolutely lends itself to [[HomeKit]].              |
| 24:08      | You don't have to have any fancy home assistant or any other technology to make it work.            |
| 24:12      | If you've got Apple Tech and you've got Apple Music, you can run this holiday playlist via          |
| 24:19      | a shortcut.                                                                                         |
| 24:21      | And it's not that hard, really.                                                                     |
| 24:23      | You just have a shortcut that plays a specific playlist on a specific device.                       |
| 24:29      | The problem is that Apple's not consistent.                                                         |
| 24:35      | You can address a specific sound device on the iPhone, but not on the Mac.                          |
| 24:41      | So every time I talk about this, people write me, like, I spent an hour, and I can't figure         |
| 24:45      | out how to find my home bot.                                                                        |
| 24:46      | I'm like, are you doing it on a Mac?                                                                |
| 24:48      | And they're like, yeah.                                                                             |
| 24:49      | I'm like, well, that's why.                                                                         |
| 24:50      | Because for whatever reason, this is one of those weird ones where you've got different             |
| 24:56      | actions available on different platforms.                                                           |
| 24:59      | And do you have any idea why, Rose?                                                                 |
| 25:02      | I have no idea why this one would be different on a Mac.                                            |
| 25:06      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 25:07      | So I kind of know why.                                                                              |
| 25:10      | And that is basically to do with the fact that [[HomeKit]] control on a Mac is interesting.             |
| 25:20      | To say the least.                                                                                   |
| 25:21      | So in order to control [[HomeKit]] stuff on a Mac, which a HomePod to be clear is part                 |
| 25:25      | of [[HomeKit]], you need to embed a whole catalyst application for that inside your app, unless         |
| 25:35      | your app is already a catalyst application.                                                         |
| 25:38      | And I suspect that they, the shortcut team didn't want to do that.                                  |
| 25:44      | But I do have a suggestion for people if they would like to control playback for things             |
| 25:50      | on a Mac, which is actually, or not control playback, but start like a music place on               |
| 25:55      | a HomePod on a Mac.                                                                                |
| 25:56      | And that is create a [[HomeKit]] scene that does that and then just run the [[HomeKit]] scene from          |
| 26:00      | your Mac.                                                                                           |
| 26:01      | Because [[HomeKit]] scenes, you can run a Mac OS, but you can't run a HomePod thing.                    |
| 26:08      | And I think that's because the [[HomeKit]] scene is handing off to the Home app, which does             |
| 26:12      | have the catalyst stuff in there.                                                                   |
| 26:14      | But the playback destination action can't do that.                                                  |
| 26:18      | So it doesn't exist on Mac or whatever.                                                             |
| 26:20      | Well, the shortcut itself, though, let's just go back to iPhone and iPad is really simple.          |
| 26:27      | You just, the simplest version is you can have, there is a get songs from playlist action,          |
| 26:34      | and then you select the holiday playlist, and you just make that the designated playlist.           |
| 26:40      | And then if you just let it go on its own, then you play it, you know, that's another               |
| 26:45      | action, just play the playlist.                                                                     |
| 26:48      | But the other thing you can do is you can set the destination on the mobile devices.                |
| 26:53      | So if you say set it for the HomePod in the family room or the kitchen or whatever.                 |
| 26:58      | And if you always want it to work the same way, then that's really easy.                            |
| 27:04      | There's no variables.                                                                               |
| 27:05      | There's no questions.                                                                               |
| 27:06      | You just push the button and the music starts up and that works really reliably.                    |
| 27:12      | If you want to do something like that, I have one and I put a audio trigger to it and says          |
| 27:17      | bring the Yule, you know, because I'm being clever.                                                 |
| 27:20      | And then it plays my holiday music in indoor studios, which is where I spend most of my             |
| 27:25      | time.                                                                                               |
| 27:26      | So like if I want holiday music while I'm working, I just say bring the Yule and off                |
| 27:30      | it goes, you know, and that's great, you know.                                                      |
| 27:33      | But if you're like, if you've got a big family, if you've got multiple HomePods, you can add        |
| 27:39      | a choose from menu list or choose from list, there's a couple of different ways you could           |
| 27:45      | go about doing it.                                                                                  |
| 27:46      | Or you could even just say, select HomePods and have it ask at the time you run.                    |
| 27:50      | And you could pick which HomePods it goes to.                                                       |
| 27:53      | So every time you trigger it, it says, OK, are you going to play it in the kitchen or               |
| 27:57      | the studio or the family room or whatever?                                                          |
| 27:59      | And then you can pick where you play it.                                                            |
| 28:02      | That works.                                                                                         |
| 28:04      | You could also just start it up and then set them manually in the music app afterwards.             |
| 28:08      | But who wants to do that?                                                                           |
| 28:09      | We're automators.                                                                                   |
| 28:11      | And then another wrinkle on this one that you could have is if you're like me and you're            |
| 28:16      | your wife thinks George Shearing is hallmark channel music, you could have a couple different       |
| 28:20      | holiday playlists and you could have the one that she likes better and you could have it.           |
| 28:25      | You could choose which holiday playlist when it runs.                                               |
| 28:29      | So you can make this as complicated as you want it.                                                 |
| 28:32      | But I do think a shortcut to trigger this stuff is always faster than going in the music            |
| 28:38      | app and kind of fiddling around with the dials.                                                     |
| 28:41      | Yeah, it almost certainly is.                                                                       |
| 28:44      | And if you have Sonos speakers, obviously you've got the [[HomeKit]] support on those, at               |
| 28:51      | least on the more modern ones.                                                                      |
| 28:53      | But I do want to give a great shout out to a little app called SORO.                                |
| 28:59      | And this adds a whole bunch of shortcuts actions for Sonos speakers to make them more [[HomeKit]]-like. |
| 29:08      | The bonus with these is SORO is available on macOS, which means that you can have your              |
| 29:15      | Mac placed up to specific speakers through SORO, which is great.                                    |
| 29:22      | And it can clear queues and get the volume and group rooms and ungroup rooms and all                |
| 29:27      | of that.                                                                                            |
| 29:28      | It can even tell it to use line in and wake a speaker and set TV autoplay and stuff like            |
| 29:33      | that.                                                                                               |
| 29:34      | So, yeah, if you have Sonos speakers, or if like me, you don't have Sonos speakers, you             |
| 29:39      | have IKEA Symphonisk speakers, which, oh, those are Sonos under the hood.                           |
| 29:44      | They work with the Sonos app.                                                                       |
| 29:45      | They work with [[HomeKit]].                                                                             |
| 29:46      | But they then have the option of being controlled through SORO, which can be a nice workaround      |
| 29:55      | for doing things on your Mac, if you would like.                                                    |
| 29:57      | Well, it's a nice automating the music and sharing it with your family, frankly.                    |
| 30:03      | And the other nice thing about that being a shortcut is once you've made a shortcut                 |
| 30:07      | out of it, then you can trigger it as part of more actions.                                         |
| 30:10      | Like you could say, bring on the Yule, not only starts the music, but turns on the tree             |
| 30:15      | lights.                                                                                             |
| 30:16      | Do you have a philosophy about tree lighting, Rose?                                                 |
| 30:20      | Like does it go on when you want it?                                                                |
| 30:22      | When I wake up?                                                                                     |
| 30:23      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 30:24      | As your way ahead of me.                                                                            |
| 30:25      | Or do you just go on like sunrise or yeah, you just run them all day.                               |
| 30:29      | So when my alarm goes off in the morning, then the lights turn on.                                  |
| 30:35      | It's very simple.                                                                                   |
| 30:37      | And then when I go to bed at night, they turn off.                                                  |
| 30:40      | And when I'm not at home, I tend to leave the Christmas tree lights on.                             |
| 30:46      | They're incredibly low power.                                                                       |
| 30:48      | But that's all I leave on.                                                                          |
| 30:51      | And then yeah, when I'm in my office or I mean, generally if I'm at home, then I have               |
| 30:57      | other lights on.                                                                                    |
| 30:59      | But yeah, especially while I'm working or podcasting or similar, then I make the point              |
| 31:04      | of having the lights behind me on because it's just a nice effect and it feels nice                 |
| 31:13      | and warm and cosy despite the fact that I'm spending all day sitting in a room working.             |
| 31:18      | Yeah, then I get the nice cheer of the season.                                                      |
| 31:22      | And especially at this time of year, I found it's nice to add a little bit of extra lighting        |
| 31:27      | in.                                                                                                 |
| 31:28      | I work pretty early for us up here in the Northern Hemisphere.                                      |
| 31:31      | One of the things I recently added to my list of improved devices, and it's not smart apart         |
| 31:39      | from the fact that I have stuck it on one of those smart USB plugs that I'm testing                 |
| 31:42      | out, is I added a streamer light.                                                                   |
| 31:47      | Now I don't really stream.                                                                          |
| 31:48      | I do obviously record iOS today every week, which has the video component that goes out.            |
| 31:53      | But I grabbed a new year, that's new EER, vlogging, I guess, or streaming light.                    |
| 32:03      | I'm not really sure if it's a vlogging light or streaming light, I don't really know.               |
| 32:07      | But it sits on my monitor, it just perches there.                                                   |
| 32:09      | It doesn't take a lot of space, it's powered by USB, but it has the different colour correction      |
| 32:14      | on it.                                                                                              |
| 32:15      | So you can get a blue light or a warm light, and you can have a bright light or a dim light         |
| 32:20      | as you would like.                                                                                  |
| 32:22      | And I have to say, I'm really enjoying this as just an option to have as extra lighting,            |
| 32:30      | because it does help wake me up a little bit during the day, obviously.                             |
| 32:34      | If anybody's got seasonal affective disorder, then one of those lights specifically designed        |
| 32:38      | for that is probably the right thing to get.                                                        |
| 32:41      | But I'm finding this one seems to be just helping me wake up and feel more awake generally.         |
| 32:47      | And also as a bonus, it makes me not look like a ghost on the camera.                               |
| 32:51      | Well, I like the tree lights going on at sunrise.                                                   |
| 32:56      | We've got a lot of people in my house that get up early and go to work or whatever, and             |
| 33:00      | I want the tree lights to be on when you come down the stairs, and I just kind of find that         |
| 33:05      | nice.                                                                                               |
| 33:06      | In fact, that kind of moving from music to lighting, that's the easiest kind of holiday             |
| 33:11      | automation, right?                                                                                  |
| 33:12      | You have it turn on at a certain time and turn off at a certain time, kind of the, what             |
| 33:18      | was it, the home alone lighting, where the crooks sit on the corner and they can look               |
| 33:22      | at each house.                                                                                      |
| 33:24      | That gets a little more subtle now that you can do it based on sunrise and sunset.                  |
| 33:28      | It's not going to be just as automatic, but with the trees, I actually have them turn               |
| 33:33      | on at sunrise and turn off at 11 p.m. every night, and we never touch the switch after              |
| 33:38      | that.                                                                                               |
| 33:39      | And that makes it really easy.                                                                      |
| 33:41      | That's part of that multiple power strip that I have, where it does that for me.                    |
| 33:45      | Yeah, and honestly, having your lights come on and off at specific times instead of based           |
| 33:50      | on whether or not you're at home is probably just generally a smart thing to do.                    |
| 33:56      | Home alone, there's a lot about that film, which is great, a lot about that film that's             |
| 34:01      | more than slightly terrifying, but people at this time of year, especially, do get unfortunately    |
| 34:08      | a little desperate, and so you probably don't actually want to automate your lights based           |
| 34:14      | on whether or not you're at home.                                                                   |
| 34:16      | You should probably just automate your lights, at least the ones that are visible to other          |
| 34:19      | folks based on time.                                                                                |
| 34:22      | And then they just come on and they go off, and people don't know whether or not you're             |
| 34:27      | at home, because yeah, the lights are always on and off.                                            |
| 34:31      | You know, when you think about it, Kevin McAllister was one of the original automators.             |
| 34:35      | Oh yeah, yeah, we should try and get him on the show.                                               |
| 34:39      | He figured out how to hit a crook in the forehead with an iron, I mean, there's some                |
| 34:45      | automation there.                                                                                   |
| 34:47      | Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's definitely some automation.                                               |
| 34:50      | Don't try that one at home, folks, that seems like a not particularly friendly way of doing         |
| 34:55      | things, and especially if you're in the United States, I hear that people that break into           |
| 34:59      | your home can sue you if they get hurt, so be careful out there as it is.                           |
| 35:06      | That's the thing, let me just say as a former lawyer, you always hear about those lawsuits,         |
| 35:09      | like the guy tripped on the sprinkler when he was stealing and he files the lawsuit.                |
| 35:13      | You always hear about those lawsuits getting filed, you never hear about them actually              |
| 35:16      | getting anything.                                                                                   |
| 35:17      | Well, I'm more thinking of like, if you do set up like a trip hazard like right inside              |
| 35:22      | your door to like, you know, trip people up when they come in and somebody like opens               |
| 35:31      | the door and comes in and then they trip over a thing, I feel like that's something that's          |
| 35:35      | more plausible than somebody tripping over a sprinkler or something, but either way,                |
| 35:41      | I still feel like it's probably a good idea to just, you know, have the outdoor lighting            |
| 35:46      | turn on and off automatically at certain times, regardless of whether or not you're at home.        |
| 35:50      | It keeps your automation simpler, makes it a lot easier to debug because there'll be                |
| 35:53      | less debugging.                                                                                     |
| 35:54      | It'll be very simple.                                                                               |
| 35:55      | It's the time this time.                                                                            |
| 35:56      | Yes, they should turn on.                                                                           |
| 35:57      | Oh, look, they turned on.                                                                           |
| 35:58      | Perfect, it worked.                                                                                 |
| 36:00      | And then, you know, you can you can spend the rest of your holiday season automating                |
| 36:04      | other things.                                                                                       |
| 36:06      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 36:07      | And just one last point on home alone, I'm pretty sure those guys should have been dead             |
| 36:10      | like six or seven times with the stuff you didn't like drop a brick on their head from              |
| 36:14      | like the second floor.                                                                              |
| 36:16      | Yeah, I feel like there would have been a good amount of brain damage involved there.               |
| 36:19      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 36:20      | But, you know, all right, it's fine.                                                                |
| 36:25      | Let's make it more complicated with holiday decorations and lighting going beyond simple            |
| 36:30      | timers, I think occupancy, you know, as Rose was saying, sometimes that makes it more complicated.  |
| 36:37      | Maybe that's not the way to do it.                                                                  |
| 36:38      | But you could do it with occupancy.                                                                 |
| 36:40      | One of the things that kind of showed up this year was occupancy or [[Human Presence Sensor\|human presence sensors]].         |
| 36:47      | I'm thinking about the ones a car is making, but I'm sure there are others in the pipeline          |
| 36:51      | too.                                                                                                |
| 36:52      | And as that's becoming more of a common thing, you could have your decorations and music            |
| 36:58      | triggered by your presence in the home or the room.                                                 |
| 37:01      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 37:03      | And honestly, it's one of those things where I have done this and I do do this to an extent.        |
| 37:10      | So my office lighting, so the seasonal lighting in my office specifically, it turns on based        |
| 37:18      | on whether or not it is a workday and whether or not I'm at home.                                   |
| 37:25      | And also on top of that, whether or not I'm in my office.                                           |
| 37:32      | But if it's a workday and it's like nine to five Monday to Friday, I have the lights                |
| 37:36      | on and they just come on this day on.                                                               |
| 37:38      | So if I pop out for a couple of minutes to go to the kitchen and grab another glass of              |
| 37:42      | water and a snack, they're not going to turn off in that time because it's kind of sad              |
| 37:46      | coming back to an office and seeing everything be all dark and your pretty lights are turned        |
| 37:51      | off and so on.                                                                                      |
| 37:53      | And then everything turns on.                                                                       |
| 37:54      | It's like, oh, yay, but you have that moment of it's not turned on and it should be.                |
| 37:59      | And so yeah.                                                                                        |
| 38:00      | Well, Monday to Friday, nine to five during my working time, while my work focus mode               |
| 38:04      | is enabled, those lights are on and they just stay on and that's it.                                |
| 38:10      | And other than that, I try not to go overboard with the Christmas decorations because I live        |
| 38:16      | in quite a small flat and it would be Christmas City in here if I weren't careful about it.         |
| 38:24      | But I tend to do the other things based on whether or not I'm around.                               |
| 38:33      | So I have been experimenting a little bit with having music play automatically when I get           |
| 38:41      | home and things like that as well.                                                                  |
| 38:43      | So when I arrive home, start playing music on my living room speakers and so on.                    |
| 38:47      | And based on the time of year, I'm selecting a different playlist.                                  |
| 38:51      | So I'm formatting the date, getting just the month and saying, hey, if the month is December,       |
| 38:58      | play this playlist on my home, on my living room HomePods, otherwise play that playlist.           |
| 39:04      | And yeah, that that seems to be working pretty well for me.                                         |
| 39:06      | I'm enjoying it, but I feel like I'm probably going to be enhancing that a little bit more.         |
| 39:11      | But I don't tend to entirely automatically play music the rest of the time, not because             |
| 39:17      | I don't want to.                                                                                    |
| 39:18      | But because it would be very awkward if I were sat in a meeting and suddenly my home                |
| 39:22      | pod starts belting out Mariah Carey.                                                                |
| 39:24      | That feels like that's only going to happen when I'm in a really important meeting at               |
| 39:29      | some point.                                                                                         |
| 39:30      | And I don't have those very often, but you can absolutely 100% guarantee that I'm going             |
| 39:34      | to have one of those when that happens.                                                             |
| 39:37      | So yeah, I'm being careful with my office home automation.                                          |
| 39:42      | I think a lot of times people get experimental with automation around the holidays.                 |
| 39:46      | That's why we like doing these shows.                                                               |
| 39:48      | You may be not using automation too often, but you're like, Hey, why not?                           |
| 39:53      | It's the holidays.                                                                                  |
| 39:54      | I want to automate my lights.                                                                       |
| 39:56      | There's a couple of ways to trigger these automations on Apple platforms.                           |
| 39:59      | You can do it in the home app where it has an automations button, where you can set                 |
| 40:03      | up an automation.                                                                                   |
| 40:05      | You can also do them through a more advanced shortcut.                                              |
| 40:08      | Rose, where is that trigger point?                                                                  |
| 40:10      | Where's the tipping point for you when you create an automation in the home app versus              |
| 40:15      | the shortcuts app?                                                                                  |
| 40:17      | So if I'm only ever going to want to run this as like a home kit scene, then, or rather,            |
| 40:25      | for me, there's a very clear delineation.                                                           |
| 40:27      | If I can do it in the home app, whether that's why I convert shortcut or not, then I definitely     |
| 40:32      | do it in the home app.                                                                              |
| 40:34      | If I can do it in the home app, but I have to convert to a shortcut, then I will consider           |
| 40:39      | at that point if I should really be doing it in the home app, or if it should be a shortcut         |
| 40:43      | because often when I start converging things to a shortcut, it's because, oh, I actually            |
| 40:49      | know I wanted to use this app to do a thing, and that app doesn't have actions available            |
| 40:55      | inside of the home kit stuff because it's an app, not native stuff.                                 |
| 41:03      | So yeah, generally, if it's just like, hey, turn on this light or something, I mean, I              |
| 41:09      | actually do it with [[Home Assistant]], but same principle, you can do it with Home Kit as well.        |
| 41:16      | So yeah, that's definitely something to consider for this sort of thing.                            |
| 41:24      | If it's a very simple automation, just keep it in the automation place for that device,             |
| 41:32      | and then yeah, other than that, because I can run home kit scenes and [[Home Assistant]]                |
| 41:37      | scenes, et cetera, through shortcuts, I don't have a problem with them being over there.            |
| 41:44      | But as it is, it's quite, I have moved a lot of things I previously had as a shortcut               |
| 41:51      | back into [[Home Assistant]] or Home Kit so that I don't have to do so many things through              |
| 41:56      | shortcuts.                                                                                          |
| 41:57      | Yeah, I'm the same way.                                                                             |
| 41:58      | I try to start in the home app.                                                                     |
| 42:00      | I mean, if you're asking me, see if you can make it work there.                                     |
| 42:05      | Sometimes you're doing one that's advanced enough that you know it's not going to work.             |
| 42:09      | You're going to need to take it up a level to two shortcuts, but quite often for holiday            |
| 42:15      | related stuff, the home app is just fine.                                                           |
| 42:17      | And then I turn them off at the end of the holidays, and then next year I come back and             |
| 42:22      | turn them back on.                                                                                  |
| 42:23      | I don't even really need to do a lot of work each year in terms of programming the automation       |
| 42:28      | once I have things kind of settled.                                                                 |
| 42:31      | And I would also recommend, if this is new to you, just start in the home app, because              |
| 42:34      | quite often that's going to be everything you need, and they have done a good job of                |
| 42:39      | giving the basics.                                                                                  |
| 42:40      | Like earlier, I talked about turning the tree lights on at sunrise.                                 |
| 42:44      | That's just an option in there.                                                                     |
| 42:45      | You push the button, it figures out when sunrise is wherever you live, and it turns the lights      |
| 42:50      | on when the sun comes up.                                                                           |
| 42:51      | So that's all you need, and keep it simple.                                                         |
| 42:56      | Speaking of keeping it simple, one other thing about holiday decorations and lighting, I'd          |
| 42:59      | say, and this is really simple, is that LED lights are very low power and can absolutely            |
| 43:06      | be run on solar-based batteries at this point, and there are a lot of products on the market        |
| 43:12      | for that.                                                                                           |
| 43:13      | Like we used to run lights into some of the trees and the bushes around the house on the            |
| 43:18      | outside, and I have moved all of those over the last few years to these little battery-backed       |
| 43:23      | LED light sensor lights, and you get a string of them.                                              |
| 43:27      | It's got a little solar charger on that you put the base of the plant or the tree or whatever,      |
| 43:33      | and the lights turn on when it gets dark and they turn off, and you don't have complete             |
| 43:37      | control over them like you would in [[HomeKit]] or any home automation system.                          |
| 43:43      | But they work, and I feel like that's something that I think automators need to consider is         |
| 43:48      | sometimes the easiest tool these days is just a string of LED lights with a solar charger.          |
| 43:52      | Yeah, definitely, and honestly, you can get a lot of great little USB-powered ones as               |
| 44:00      | well, which especially if you've got children or you have an inner child like me, and you           |
| 44:07      | want pretty lights and you want lots of them, but you do not want a giant energy bill.              |
| 44:11      | A string of USB-powered lights is great, and yeah, I personally have quite a few of those           |
| 44:20      | running around, and it's lovely because I can have a little bit of Christmas decor in               |
| 44:24      | my bedroom with some USB-powered lights, but I don't have a huge amount.                            |
| 44:29      | It's not using a ton of power, and I only needed to find a USB port to plug this stuff              |
| 44:33      | into rather than having to find an extra plug socket, which considering the fact that my            |
| 44:37      | bedroom has exactly five plug sockets in it before extension leads, is difficult to say             |
| 44:43      | the least because I don't actually want to trip the electrics if I plug too much                    |
| 44:49      | stuff in that would be problematic.                                                                 |
| 44:51      | So yeah, the USB-powered lights and solar-powered lights are very simple and very effective,        |
| 44:57      | and yeah, it's also one of those things where it's easy enough to gift somebody something           |
| 45:01      | like that if you are trying to get them into the world of automation in a friendly manner,          |
| 45:07      | because most people have seasonal and holiday lighting that they would like to turn on and          |
| 45:11      | off at certain times, like on its sunset and off at 10pm or something like that, so a smart         |
| 45:17      | plug can be a great gift for somebody like that a little earlier in the holiday season.             |
| 45:22      | One of the best gifts you can give somebody in the United States is a Lutron Casetaa               |
| 45:25      | switch because you have to install it for them or get an electrician if they don't                  |
| 45:30      | know what they're doing with the wall switches, but boy, that's an automation that immediately      |
| 45:35      | takes for people, but I want to go back also to, I have something for you.                          |
| 45:41      | I think it's an unsolvable automation problem.                                                      |
| 45:44      | I have a little desk in my studio that's a rolling desk.                                            |
| 45:49      | I move it around, goes up and down, and I put it in shots and I take it out of shots                |
| 45:54      | and I use it.                                                                                       |
| 45:55      | Every holiday season, I get a little fir tree at the local hardware store and I bonsai it.          |
| 46:02      | I cut most of the limbs out of it and I wire the limb straight and I decorate it, and it's          |
| 46:06      | just my little tree every year, and then I go plant it in the yard after the holiday,               |
| 46:10      | and so it's on a desk that does not have a power, it's not plugged in anywhere, and                 |
| 46:16      | the desk rolls around the room, and I put a set of tiny, tiny LED, almost diode-based               |
| 46:24      | lights on it that run off a couple C batteries, and I turn it on and then I turn it off when        |
| 46:30      | I leave the room manually because I don't have a way to put this on home kit or any                 |
| 46:35      | sort of automation trigger.                                                                         |
| 46:37      | I know I could put a solar sensor in, but I actually like them on during the daytime.               |
| 46:43      | Can you think of a way for me to automate that?                                                     |
| 46:45      | I don't think there is a way.                                                                       |
| 46:47      | So David, I kind of have a solution for you, kind of.                                               |
| 46:51      | I mean, you already have HomoSystem.                                                                |
| 46:53      | So I mentioned earlier that I have some smart USB plugs, and why I say smart USB plugs?             |
| 46:58      | I mean, it is a USB-A out USB-A in, so you plug a USB thing into it and it plugs into               |
| 47:04      | a USB port.                                                                                         |
| 47:05      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 47:06      | So I would suggest, to start with, you should try one of those and a large battery pack.            |
| 47:16      | Now I have a recommendation for a certain kind of battery pack because I discovered recently        |
| 47:24      | Anker have a very cool new series of chargers which can plunk onto a dock, which is just            |
| 47:33      | like a little black square puck that lives on your desk and it has a 100 watt power output          |
| 47:38      | and it's got like four little, almost like [[MagSafe]] or smart connector from your iPad,               |
| 47:50      | connectors on it.                                                                                   |
| 47:51      | And then you see, you plunk the power bank onto that and it will recharge.                          |
| 47:55      | So whenever your desk is within range of that, you can just sort of put the battery pack            |
| 47:59      | on there and charge it, or of course you can unplug it.                                             |
| 48:02      | And then you can just have these lights.                                                            |
| 48:06      | And because the smart USB plug is there, when you're not in the room, it can turn off.              |
| 48:10      | When you go to bed, it can make sure it's turned off and stuff like that.                           |
| 48:13      | And then when you come in, it can turn on because you've got motion sensors and so on               |
| 48:16      | in your room.                                                                                       |
| 48:17      | You've got focus modes and so on, which you can pass off the state of, et cetera.                   |
| 48:22      | So I think that that's something that you should investigate because I feel like that               |
| 48:27      | seems like a good solution to this problem.                                                         |
| 48:30      | Yeah, I mean, the way I'd probably solve it is I do have a big battery bank where I probably        |
| 48:37      | would put it in the, there's a drawer underneath this rolling desk and I could probably drill       |
| 48:42      | a hole out the back and just run a line to the smart USB sensor, which would be right               |
| 48:50      | in the pot or right next to the plant.                                                              |
| 48:53      | And then I would have to recharge it probably once in a while.                                      |
| 48:56      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 48:57      | I would put the smart USB directly into the power bank and just run the cable from the              |
| 49:00      | lights into the drawer so that you don't have, because the smart USB plug, it's not that            |
| 49:06      | big, but it's definitely, it's like, I don't know, maybe an inch square with the USB bit            |
| 49:13      | sticking out.                                                                                       |
| 49:14      | But yeah, Anker do a couple of different sizes of the power bank.                                   |
| 49:20      | I think it's called the Anker Prime power bank.                                                     |
| 49:24      | And I'm going to put a link in the show notes to the dock and one of the batteries.                 |
| 49:31      | I have one of the smaller batteries and honestly, I love it.                                        |
| 49:34      | It's great because you press it on the side and it tells you the percentage it's at.                |
| 49:37      | It tells you how much power is being drawn from the different ports on the battery pack.            |
| 49:42      | It's absolutely fabulous.                                                                           |
| 49:44      | So yeah, that's a recommendation for folks if they are, they need a new power bank this             |
| 49:49      | holiday season, Anker Prime.                                                                        |
| 49:51      | That's one of my recommendations.                                                                   |
| 49:53      | Yeah, Anker makes such great batteries.                                                             |
| 49:56      | I only buy their stuff and there's a lot of press right now about fake products that look           |
| 50:05      | like an Apple power supply and then they X-ray them and they don't have all the parts inside        |
| 50:10      | them that they need.                                                                                |
| 50:12      | For instance, the ground wire is not attached.                                                      |
| 50:16      | But Anker is a company I feel like I can trust.                                                     |
| 50:18      | I've been very happy with their products and yeah, I could see that.                                |
| 50:23      | Well, Rosie gave me an option, you know, I'm going to give it a try.                                |
| 50:27      | So I may not buy another battery though because I have so many of them, I don't mind taking         |
| 50:32      | it out.                                                                                             |
| 50:33      | But yeah, if you already have a bunch of them, then that's fine.                                    |
| 50:36      | Yeah, especially if you've got more than one, then you can swap between them so you can             |
| 50:39      | take one out and plug a new one in and then, you know, and just put the one that you've             |
| 50:43      | just taken out on charge or something like that, which yeah, seems like a good solution             |
| 50:48      | to me.                                                                                              |
| 50:49      | And these lights are incredibly low draw.                                                           |
| 50:51      | So I feel like I could, on a big Anker battery, I could probably run them a long time where         |
| 50:56      | it'd be like probably a weekly thing of recharging it.                                              |
| 51:00      | But yeah, that's a good idea.                                                                       |
| 51:02      | But the USB is the trick, right?                                                                    |
| 51:06      | You know, the USB switch, something very light and something low power and that's what had          |
| 51:11      | always hung me up on this because I don't have, you know, the normal 110 power at this              |
| 51:16      | desk and I wanted to roll around the room and I don't want to have to.                              |
| 51:19      | I don't want to have a plug on this desk just so this tree works.                                   |
| 51:23      | That really, I don't, I want it really simple.                                                      |
| 51:26      | And anyway, I guess you could say simple because I'm going to make it much more complex in          |
| 51:31      | order to keep the simplicity.                                                                       |
| 51:32      | Yeah, but at the same time, like the effect is that it looks simple because the other               |
| 51:37      | option is of course just simply mount a power strip to the underside of the draw on this            |
| 51:40      | thing and then or to the back of it or something and plug it in wherever it is in the room.         |
| 51:45      | And then you can even have a smart plug on the tree lights, woohoo, but you don't have              |
| 51:52      | to do that.                                                                                         |
| 51:53      | So, you know.                                                                                       |
| 51:54      | Well, the idea of a smart home friendly USB power switches is pretty clever, you know?              |
| 52:02      | I mean, I do wish it was [[HomeKit]] though, but I don't mind running it [[Home Assistant]].                |
| 52:06      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 52:07      | I mean, you can just put it in [[Home Assistant]] and share as a smart light even to [[HomeKit]]            |
| 52:13      | instead of sharing it as a smart switch and then changing it to a light and [[HomeKit]].                |
| 52:17      | And then it'll just be a light that's a little on and off thing, but you know, that works           |
| 52:21      | really well.                                                                                        |
| 52:22      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 52:23      | And it's 10 bucks on Amazon in the US, crazy.                                                       |
| 52:26      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                      |
| 52:28      | So it's worth giving these things a go and trying them out.                                         |
| 52:32      | And yeah, I have just checked, unfortunately, it looks like those anchor power banks, they          |
| 52:35      | are insanely popular to the point where they're not shipping for a while.                           |
| 52:40      | Looks like they're not going to ship until sort of December or so, which is kind of crazy.          |
| 52:46      | But hopefully, I found whenever I order stuff from Anchor, they use Amazon shipping, same           |
| 52:50      | as mouse, M-O-U-S-2.                                                                                |
| 52:53      | And yeah, that definitely speeds things up.                                                         |
| 52:58      | And they're very much a learn from Apple, under promise, over deliver, we'll tell you               |
| 53:03      | it'll be here by the end of next month and then it turns up like four days later or something       |
| 53:07      | like that.                                                                                          |
| 53:08      | So yeah, definitely, it's the right way to do it if you're going to make a promise there            |
| 53:14      | on something like that.                                                                             |
| 53:15      | Do you want me to make you feel bad?                                                                |
| 53:17      | Oh, okay.                                                                                           |
| 53:18      | In the US, I could get it tomorrow.                                                                 |
| 53:20      | No, I was looking at the Amazon product page in the US for those batteries.                         |
| 53:25      | I mean, I already have one of those batteries and I have the charger for it as well.                |
| 53:29      | I really like the fact that the charging base, like you just drop the battery pack on there         |
| 53:32      | and it charges, like you don't have to have a USB cable to charge the battery.                      |
| 53:37      | And it's got USB ports on the base as well.                                                         |
| 53:39      | So you've got space to charge like, you know, like a phone or a tablet or a laptop because          |
| 53:46      | it's 100 watt output and a couple of USB A things as well as charging the battery pack,             |
| 53:53      | which is really handy.                                                                              |
| 53:55      | Also, I remembered, I bought a smart light.                                                         |
| 53:59      | I bought one that can actually be controlled via USB.                                               |
| 54:03      | Like you plug the USB power into your Mac for your light and it has all the controls                |
| 54:13      | on your Mac, which is perfect.                                                                      |
| 54:16      | So I have updated the show notes to reflect that.                                                   |
| 54:19      | That's fun.                                                                                         |
| 54:20      | It's like the Elgato ones, except it's cheaper and it also has [[Stream Deck]] support.                 |
| 54:27      | So our last topic is what's in the present bag and Rose has referenced Elfster.                     |
| 54:33      | What is Elfster, Rose?                                                                              |
| 54:35      | So Elfster is a service.                                                                            |
| 54:37      | It's not the best service I'm going to admit, but it's a service and it works really well           |
| 54:45      | for doing Secret Santa.                                                                             |
| 54:47      | So I'm in charge of organising my work Secret Santa.                                                |
| 54:49      | So if I were organising this and I weren't using any tools, I would have to get a list              |
| 54:55      | of people who were going to participate.                                                            |
| 54:58      | And I'd have to randomise the list to match people up and so that everybody gets somebody           |
| 55:05      | else, nobody gets themselves.                                                                       |
| 55:07      | And then I'd have to send individual emails to every single person saying, this is the              |
| 55:12      | person that you've got.                                                                             |
| 55:13      | And I'd have to answer all the emails going, I lost the person who I'm assigned to.                 |
| 55:17      | Can you tell me?                                                                                    |
| 55:18      | And then people would have to email me wish lists and I'd have to pass them along and               |
| 55:24      | pass on notes like, I'm deadly allergic to nuts.                                                    |
| 55:27      | Do not buy me anything with nuts in and stuff like that, which is just a lot of responsibility      |
| 55:31      | because I really don't want anybody to die at my Secret Santa or as a result of my Secret           |
| 55:35      | Santa.                                                                                              |
| 55:36      | Elfster is a free online service.                                                                   |
| 55:39      | They make money by having you add individual products to your wish list, which they will            |
| 55:44      | then convert into affiliate links.                                                                  |
| 55:48      | So they're an online service where people can sign up and they can create like a wish               |
| 55:53      | list, which can be like, I want this specific thing or giving general ideas of various sort         |
| 56:00      | of things that they think would be fun to receive or, you know, please don't get me                 |
| 56:06      | something that contains nuts because I'm allergic to nuts, et cetera.                               |
| 56:09      | So they can put stuff in there.                                                                     |
| 56:10      | It'll match people up.                                                                              |
| 56:11      | It allows you to add latecomers and so on and so forth.                                             |
| 56:15      | And honestly, I've been using it for a couple of years now.                                         |
| 56:17      | I know a whole bunch of groups who use this.                                                        |
| 56:19      | It's very simple to use.                                                                            |
| 56:21      | It's very easy to use.                                                                              |
| 56:23      | There's an app you can download to use it with or use with it.                                      |
| 56:27      | And it just takes the work away and delegation is a form of automation, like making a service       |
| 56:33      | or a person do your work for you is that that's automation.                                         |
| 56:37      | And Elfster is an automation I am glad and happy to use.                                            |
| 56:41      | Yeah, this absolutely is a form of automation and I wasn't aware of it, but I don't have            |
| 56:46      | to do these kinds of things too much.                                                               |
| 56:48      | So I wouldn't be and that's cool.                                                                   |
| 56:51      | Thanks for sharing that.                                                                            |
| 56:52      | Yeah, well, if anybody needs to organise a Secret Santa for work, you know, for some                |
| 56:56      | folks it may be a little too late this year when this episode goes out or it may be just            |
| 56:59      | in time.                                                                                            |
| 57:00      | I don't know.                                                                                       |
| 57:01      | But yeah, it's just a useful thing to be aware of as a tool and you may end up just                 |
| 57:12      | sharing that information with somebody else at some point where somebody's like, oh, I've           |
| 57:16      | got to organise a Secret Santa and oh, well, I've got a service for you.                            |
| 57:20      | So yeah, that's a little recommendation that I have.                                                |
| 57:24      | So another idea I had was some people do Elf on the shelf, which is like this idea that             |
| 57:28      | you take a little elf and you put it in various places around your house in various silly           |
| 57:31      | situations every day and so on and so forth for your children or yourself, you know, whatever.      |
| 57:38      | I thought instead of putting an elf on a shelf and doing very silly things with it, you could       |
| 57:42      | challenge yourself every day this December to create or improve an automation every day             |
| 57:46      | as sort of a start for the new year so that then when you go into the new year, you can             |
| 57:51      | have a list of ideas of things that you've come up with over the last month that, you               |
| 57:55      | know, you didn't quite get around to or something because you've been busy because, you know,       |
| 57:59      | it's December and people are pretty busy in December.                                               |
| 58:03      | And so yeah, I personally find this is an ideal time of year because it's chilly and                |
| 58:08      | dark so you don't want to go outside to like sit and do a little review of some of your             |
| 58:13      | automations and figure out ways to improve them or tweak them and add to them and amp               |
| 58:18      | them up if necessary and, you know, just create one or two fun little simple ones.                  |
| 58:23      | All right.                                                                                          |
| 58:24      | Well, I hope that we've given you some inspiration and some ideas for automating your holiday       |
| 58:29      | season.                                                                                             |
| 58:30      | You know, we have the Automators forums over at talk.automators.fm, there's a lot of people        |
| 58:36      | over there talking about ways to automate as well if you have any problems or send us               |
| 58:39      | feedback.                                                                                           |
| 58:40      | It's not a lot of time for us to do a feedback show anyway.                                         |
| 58:43      | Either way, we are the Automators.                                                                  |
