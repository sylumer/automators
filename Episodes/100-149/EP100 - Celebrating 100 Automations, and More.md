| 00:00      | Hello, I'm David Sparks,                                          |
| 00:03      | and joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard,                       |
| 00:05      | and this is the Automators,                                       |
| 00:06      | where we talk about how to automate                               |
| 00:08      | your technology to do your bidding for you.                       |
| 00:11      | Hello, Rose.                                                      |
| 00:12      | Hey, David. It's episode 100.                                     |
| 00:14      | Yes. Where are the fireworks?                                     |
| 00:16      | Did we get fireworks?                                             |
| 00:17      | Yeah, I think we do. I think we get fireworks.                    |
| 00:19      | They're going off right now.                                      |
| 00:20      | Yeah, we get the whole Disney parade of fireworks, please.        |
| 00:23      | They're going off in my mind.                                     |
| 00:24      | I'm just seeing here, look,                                       |
| 00:25      | there was a Mickey Mouse shaped one.                              |
| 00:27      | It's just not, it was great.                                      |
| 00:29      | Yeah, no, it seems like just yesterday,                           |
| 00:31      | you and I were having the idea for the show.                      |
| 00:33      | I actually vividly remember at the beginning of episode 10,       |
| 00:36      | you and I saying, hey, we made it to 10.                          |
| 00:39      | That's good, right?                                               |
| 00:40      | Yep. We beat Grey's expectation for [[Cortex]],                       |
| 00:43      | which I think is a benchmark in all podcast recording.            |
| 00:46      | So I'm pleased that we got that far,                              |
| 00:49      | and that we've multiplied it by a factor of 10.                   |
| 00:52      | Yay. Yeah.                                                        |
| 00:53      | 100 episodes about automation,                                    |
| 00:55      | and the goal is the same.                                         |
| 00:57      | You know, we want everybody to be able to automate.               |
| 00:59      | We want to share our enthusiasm for the subject,                  |
| 01:02      | but also some tips and news and everything related to automation. |
| 01:07      | And there is an audience for this.                                |
| 01:10      | Thank you for listening. We really appreciate it.                 |
| 01:12      | And we hope we are continuing to help you along that path.        |
| 01:16      | Yeah, we really do.                                               |
| 01:17      | And we've had a lot of fun getting this far.                      |
| 01:19      | So, you know, let's continue with that.                           |
| 01:22      | Yeah, exactly.                                                    |
| 01:23      | In fact, later we're going to talk about                          |
| 01:24      | what we'd like to see happen between now and episode 200.         |
| 01:27      | But that's for later.                                             |
| 01:29      | One of the things we wanted to talk about                         |
| 01:33      | with it being episode 100 was kind of take a look back            |
| 01:36      | at what were the popular topics and subjects                      |
| 01:40      | for the first 100 episodes.                                       |
| 01:42      | So, of course, Rose wrote a script to figure that out.            |
| 01:45      | We're going to pull that apart in the Automator's Max later,      |
| 01:50      | but how you did it.                                               |
| 01:51      | But tell us the results, Rose.                                    |
| 01:53      | What did we get out of our algorithm for the Automator's?         |
| 01:58      | Well, [[Pythonista]] definitely came up                            |
| 02:00      | because I used it to write this particular script                 |
| 02:03      | to get this data.                                                 |
| 02:04      | But there were quite a few apps                                   |
| 02:06      | who made it into our most wanted list.                            |
| 02:10      | Let's call it a most wanted.                                      |
| 02:11      | But in the good sense, they get automation stars                  |
| 02:14      | rather than people getting bonus or bounty                        |
| 02:18      | for bringing them in.                                             |
| 02:19      | So, there's quite a list here.                                    |
| 02:22      | And these are not sorted in any particular order,                 |
| 02:25      | I should note.                                                    |
| 02:26      | But [[Keyboard Maestro]], obviously, [[Drafts]], [[Shortcuts]],               |
| 02:29      | or as it was when we very first started, [[Workflow]].                |
| 02:33      | If this and that, [[Make\|Integromat]],                                     |
| 02:35      | which is recently renamed to [[Make]], [[Hazel]],                |
| 02:39      | [[TextExpander]], [[Bunch]], [[Pushcut]], [[JavaScript]],                         |
| 02:42      | obviously has come up a lot,                                      |
| 02:44      | as has [[Python]], [[Alfred]], [[Zapier]], [[Automator]], and [[AppleScript]].        |
| 02:49      | And wow, that is quite a list of most wanted.                     |
| 02:53      | Yeah, those are definitely great utilities                        |
| 02:56      | to help you automate.                                             |
| 02:57      | If you master all those, you're in great shape.                   |
| 03:00      | But a couple of them that stand out to me,                        |
| 03:03      | I feel like [[Keyboard Maestro]] just continues                       |
| 03:06      | to be the Swiss Army knife of automation on the Mac.              |
| 03:09      | It's like so often,                                               |
| 03:12      | and even with the emergence of Shortcuts for the Mac,             |
| 03:14      | I still find myself in a pinch                                    |
| 03:17      | just going to [[Keyboard Maestro]] and building.                      |
| 03:19      | It's, in a lot of ways, easier than Shortcuts.                    |
| 03:23      | It's not as powerful in some ways.                                |
| 03:24      | I mean, that we've talked about in the past,                      |
| 03:27      | this comparison between [[Keyboard Maestro]] and Shortcuts            |
| 03:31      | on the Mac, how they're kind of complementary.                    |
| 03:33      | But in a jam, [[Keyboard Maestro]] continues to be                    |
| 03:38      | my very favourite automation tool for the Mac.                     |
| 03:42      | Yeah, it is one of those apps where I never really feel           |
| 03:45      | like I'm using it as much as I should.                            |
| 03:48      | But the secret to all automation is it doesn't matter             |
| 03:51      | if you're using it as much as you think you should,               |
| 03:53      | it matters if it solves a problem that you have.                  |
| 03:56      | And that is what [[Keyboard Maestro]] so frequently does.             |
| 03:59      | What it's doing right now as we record this podcast,              |
| 04:02      | it's helping me log timestamps in our show notes                  |
| 04:05      | so that I can easily give those notes over                        |
| 04:08      | to our wonderful editor, Jim.                                     |
| 04:10      | So that we actually have useful information,                      |
| 04:13      | but it's just constantly there as part of my day                  |
| 04:16      | doing something in the background.                                |
| 04:18      | And when it's not, it's doing something by being there            |
| 04:21      | ready for me to use it.                                           |
| 04:24      | So that's great.                                                  |
| 04:25      | One of the best things I've done with [[Keyboard Maestro]]            |
| 04:28      | is that contextual computing setup                                |
| 04:30      | where I create the conflict palettes.                             |
| 04:33      | And the one I use most is Option Control Command M                |
| 04:38      | for MacSparky.                                                   |
| 04:40      | And a lot of the stuff I do as MacSparky lands                   |
| 04:44      | with that keyboard shortcut,                                      |
| 04:46      | just to give you an example, a few days ago,                      |
| 04:48      | I was working on the labs.                                        |
| 04:50      | You know, I have this new thing with the MacSparky labs          |
| 04:52      | and there are, when I release new content,                        |
| 04:58      | in addition to putting it in the blog                             |
| 04:59      | and sending out a newsletter,                                     |
| 05:01      | I also have a special page on MacSparky                          |
| 05:04      | that only labs members can access.                                |
| 05:05      | And there are three of those pages                                |
| 05:08      | because there's three different levels.                           |
| 05:09      | And, but I update the content there as well                       |
| 05:12      | because some people like to go to the website,                    |
| 05:14      | some people like the RSS, you know,                               |
| 05:16      | everybody's got a different way of accessing the stuff.           |
| 05:18      | But I realised the other day,                                     |
| 05:19      | I was spending a bunch of time to open those tabs up              |
| 05:22      | to update content whenever there was new content.                 |
| 05:26      | So I just made a really quick keyboard Maestro shortcut           |
| 05:29      | and I could have done it in shortcuts for Mac,                    |
| 05:31      | but I did it in [[Keyboard Maestro]] and it opens [[Safari]]              |
| 05:35      | and it opens three tabs, you know,                                |
| 05:37      | the three tabs I need to use,                                     |
| 05:39      | but it also opens up the Memberful page                           |
| 05:41      | with the links I need and it opens up the calendar.               |
| 05:43      | It does, there's like four or five things                         |
| 05:46      | I always do at once with this.                                    |
| 05:48      | And all I did was I named it labs dash member tabs                |
| 05:52      | and I gave it the magic option command control M shortcut.        |
| 05:58      | And now anytime I need to do that,                                |
| 06:00      | I just hit that conflict palette in [[Keyboard Maestro]],             |
| 06:03      | tap like L and then M, I think.                                   |
| 06:06      | And then it just sets that up for me, you know,                   |
| 06:09      | and that was something I was doing manually                       |
| 06:10      | for like a month because I just hadn't got around                 |
| 06:13      | to automate it.                                                   |
| 06:14      | When I finally did it, it took all of like two minutes,           |
| 06:17      | but it's a very simple automation,                                |
| 06:20      | but having [[Keyboard Maestro]] always in the background              |
| 06:22      | setting by saying, put me in coach, whatever you need,            |
| 06:25      | I'll do the grunt work for you.                                   |
| 06:28      | It's really kind of great.                                        |
| 06:29      | It really is, yeah.                                               |
| 06:31      | And I have to say it's one of those things                        |
| 06:33      | where this is a classic case of the two of us solving             |
| 06:36      | that problem very differently,                                    |
| 06:38      | because for me, I have a bunch of bookmarks folders               |
| 06:40      | where I can just middle click on the folder                       |
| 06:42      | and it will open those tabs,                                      |
| 06:44      | but that only works if you have a limited number                  |
| 06:46      | of those folders.                                                 |
| 06:48      | And I've put that particular scenario for,                        |
| 06:51      | these are the tabs I need for recording automators                |
| 06:53      | or similar inside of bunch,                                       |
| 06:55      | because bunch is what sets me up for those things,                |
| 06:58      | but I do still have instances where [[Keyboard Maestro]]              |
| 07:00      | will open a bunch of tabs or open different windows               |
| 07:04      | and certain applications for me                                   |
| 07:05      | because it's either the first tool that I put in                  |
| 07:08      | to solve that problem or it was the right tool for that,          |
| 07:11      | or I just like doing it that way for that particular scenario     |
| 07:15      | and that's one of the reasons why it's so great                   |
| 07:18      | because you can't just put it in whenever you need it.            |
| 07:20      | Yeah, and the funny thing is like,                                |
| 07:22      | once you start putting that together,                             |
| 07:24      | then you're like, oh, wait a second,                              |
| 07:25      | I could also automate, how is it named and linked?                |
| 07:29      | Or I could, because the other thing I do is I put links,          |
| 07:31      | there's also a shared calendar for each of the members,           |
| 07:35      | so they can look at it.                                           |
| 07:35      | Some people just like to go in the calendar                       |
| 07:37      | and get the content through the calendar.                         |
| 07:39      | So I can have it open the calendar                                |
| 07:41      | to the specific calendars I want.                                 |
| 07:43      | And you build it just as a group of links,                        |
| 07:46      | but then because you've got some automation skills,               |
| 07:51      | you start saying, well, there's other things I do                 |
| 07:52      | when I do this, like I could start a timer                        |
| 07:54      | and I could open the calendar and whatever,                       |
| 07:59      | I could, you put it all together.                                 |
| 08:02      | And the thing about [[Keyboard Maestro]] is that                      |
| 08:04      | it pretty much lets you pick any combination                      |
| 08:09      | of things you wanna do in your Mac,                               |
| 08:10      | and it does it for you.                                           |
| 08:12      | Yes, exactly.                                                     |
| 08:13      | And it's there ready, waiting in the wings                        |
| 08:16      | to do the things that can't be done either                        |
| 08:19      | with the stuff like Click It Image.                               |
| 08:21      | It's kind of like a Bachelor Touch Tool,                          |
| 08:23      | which we talked about a little bit in the last episode            |
| 08:25      | with [[Federico Viticci]] and John Voorhees                         |
| 08:28      | of it having some of that magic that fixes                        |
| 08:31      | a bunch of other things.                                          |
| 08:32      | Keyboard Maestro's Click It Image                                 |
| 08:35      | does just solve a whole bunch of things.                          |
| 08:37      | The filter text function allows you to do                         |
| 08:39      | a whole bunch of things that I keep being surprised.              |
| 08:42      | I'm looking for it going along,                                   |
| 08:43      | getting each build a complicated regular expression.              |
| 08:45      | I'll just look in that, oh no,                                    |
| 08:46      | that action can just do this for me.                              |
| 08:48      | Brilliant, thank you.                                             |
| 08:51      | And that is just so great.                                        |
| 08:54      | Also like high on our list was shortcuts, of course.              |
| 08:57      | And shortcuts really was kind of how we got started.              |
| 09:01      | So I was thinking back to this.                                   |
| 09:03      | We, when you and I started the show,                              |
| 09:06      | we had recorded some episodes                                     |
| 09:08      | and then everything got replaced                                  |
| 09:11      | because at the time we recorded the episodes,                     |
| 09:13      | Apple released shortcuts.                                         |
| 09:15      | And...                                                            |
| 09:16      | Yeah, we were at [[WWDC]].                                            |
| 09:18      | I just spoken to [[Myke Hurley]] and I met Steven.                    |
| 09:23      | And we were confirming everything was ready to go                 |
| 09:25      | and we had some episodes.                                         |
| 09:27      | And then Apple threw a really lovely curve ball                   |
| 09:30      | in the forward shortcuts.                                         |
| 09:31      | And it's like, all right, where's the trash can?                  |
| 09:34      | We need that.                                                     |
| 09:35      | Yeah, but it's awesome that this show was born                    |
| 09:37      | at the same time as shortcuts.                                    |
| 09:39      | And I feel like it's so appropriate                               |
| 09:41      | and we're on this kind of path together to a certain extent.      |
| 09:43      | And we've been hard on shortcuts for the Mac                      |
| 09:47      | in terms of the rough launch,                                     |
| 09:49      | but I don't think we've been entirely fair in the sense.          |
| 09:52      | Cause like as I've been,                                          |
| 09:53      | I've spent so much time with shortcuts                            |
| 09:54      | working on this new field guide that is almost done.              |
| 09:58      | It's really pretty great to have it on the Mac.                   |
| 10:00      | The fact that the stuff you write on iPad and OS                  |
| 10:04      | just shows up.                                                    |
| 10:04      | And at this point, we're six months in,                           |
| 10:08      | they fix most of the bugs, everything generally works.            |
| 10:11      | I mean, I find, just like I find all kinds of users               |
| 10:14      | for keyboard moisture,                                            |
| 10:15      | I find all kinds of users for shortcuts too.                      |
| 10:18      | Yes, exactly.                                                     |
| 10:19      | And it's one of those things where                                |
| 10:21      | when I was doing the automation to get the links                  |
| 10:25      | out of the show notes and some of the keywords,                   |
| 10:27      | try and match some stuff up,                                      |
| 10:30      | I considered using shortcuts for it.                              |
| 10:31      | And the only reason why I didn't use shortcuts for it             |
| 10:34      | was because I was going to be building dictionaries               |
| 10:36      | and just incrementing numbers.                                    |
| 10:38      | And it seemed like it was going to be quite tricky                |
| 10:41      | to do that in shortcuts.                                          |
| 10:45      | And it was going to be easier to do it in a script                |
| 10:47      | and considering, you know,                                        |
| 10:48      | the number of scripting languages available to me,                |
| 10:51      | it was going to be really fast.                                   |
| 10:52      | And it took me all of about 20 minutes to do it in the end,       |
| 10:55      | which probably wouldn't have taken that much longer               |
| 10:57      | with shortcuts.                                                   |
| 10:59      | But, you know, it is definitely a tool                            |
| 11:01      | I could have used for that.                                       |
| 11:03      | And I feel like it is, you know,                                  |
| 11:05      | often to an extent dismisses,                                     |
| 11:08      | oh, right, it's something that you used to change app icons.      |
| 11:10      | Or it's really under powered                                       |
| 11:11      | because you can't just type what you want into it.                |
| 11:14      | But honestly, it is a really great tool                           |
| 11:18      | that is now ubiquitous on Apple platforms.                        |
| 11:21      | Some of the actions aren't,                                       |
| 11:22      | but the app itself and its existence is.                          |
| 11:25      | I mean, assuming everyone is running, you know,                   |
| 11:27      | the latest operating system.                                      |
| 11:29      | So I'm really glad that it's here.                                |
| 11:32      | And I'm hoping it's here to stay.                                 |
| 11:34      | Yeah. I mean, ubiquitous is the right word for it.                |
| 11:37      | And I agree with you.                                             |
| 11:38      | I mean, and the thing is kind of getting back                     |
| 11:41      | to the purpose of the show                                        |
| 11:42      | to teach anybody how to automate.                                 |
| 11:44      | There really isn't an easier place to start than shortcuts        |
| 11:47      | because it literally is Lego blocks.                              |
| 11:50      | You drag on top of each other                                     |
| 11:51      | and stuff happens on your device.                                 |
| 11:53      | It's pretty awesome. Yes.                                         |
| 11:54      | Yeah, it really is.                                               |
| 11:56      | Though I would say I do feel that maybe [[Drafts]] deserves           |
| 12:01      | a good place in there as well                                     |
| 12:03      | because creating automations in [[Drafts]],                           |
| 12:06      | especially with some of the updates it's had recently,            |
| 12:09      | is incredibly easy to do                                          |
| 12:10      | without reaching for the script action.                           |
| 12:12      | Now, I personally still reach for the script action               |
| 12:14      | because my automations never stay that simple.                    |
| 12:18      | But there are things like prompts and more                        |
| 12:21      | in the script actions,                                            |
| 12:22      | allowing you to really get very creative with what you do         |
| 12:26      | so that you can insert all sorts of kind of data                  |
| 12:29      | or update a draft, some file them as you see fit,                 |
| 12:33      | which is very easy to do.                                         |
| 12:35      | And I think because you've got the text right there,              |
| 12:39      | it's very easy to understand what you're doing as well.           |
| 12:41      | Yeah, I guess we should mention                                   |
| 12:43      | that [[Drafts]] just celebrated its 10th anniversary.                 |
| 12:45      | And congratulations to Greg for 10 years                          |
| 12:48      | of really making automation a thing, iOS.                         |
| 12:52      | I agree, and that is a very frequent reference.                   |
| 12:55      | If you look at the links that come out of the show                |
| 12:57      | and the discussions, [[Drafts]] comes up repeatedly.                  |
| 13:01      | We have guests that we had no idea used [[Drafts]] at all             |
| 13:04      | and they'll tell us all about the ways they're using [[Drafts]].      |
| 13:07      | Yeah, yeah, and it's so common that I talk to somebody            |
| 13:12      | and I say, oh, you know,                                          |
| 13:14      | you could really solve this easily with [[Drafts]].                   |
| 13:17      | And they go, oh, I don't know.                                    |
| 13:19      | And I sort of get them started                                    |
| 13:20      | by creating the start of an action for them.                      |
| 13:23      | And then they come back later                                     |
| 13:24      | and they've done things that I forgot were action,                |
| 13:27      | like action steps that you can add in [[Drafts]]                     |
| 13:30      | because there's just so much there                                |
| 13:32      | and they're talking about how amazing it is and wonderful.        |
| 13:35      | And I love that, I love that so much                              |
| 13:37      | because it really is a really great tool.                         |
| 13:41      | And again, it's ubiquitous because it's on the Mac now.           |
| 13:43      | I'm so glad [[Drafts]] exist on the Mac.                              |
| 13:45      | I swear I type more text into that app                            |
| 13:47      | than I do probably even my ID,                                    |
| 13:50      | which I used to develop.                                          |
| 13:51      | So I'm writing a lot of code,                                     |
| 13:53      | but I write a lot of text too.                                    |
| 13:55      | Yeah, I mean, this makes it really easy.                          |
| 13:56      | And then, you know, you can send it anywhere you want.            |
| 13:59      | What they call the place for text, right?                         |
| 14:02      | Yep, that place where text starts.                                |
| 14:03      | So that's the triumvirate, right?                                 |
| 14:05      | You know, shortcuts, [[Drafts]], keyboard, my stroke.                 |
| 14:07      | But behind that and links and references,                         |
| 14:11      | something that I didn't really expect                             |
| 14:13      | when we started this show                                         |
| 14:14      | is the increasing references to cloud-based automation tools      |
| 14:19      | and we talked about [[IFTTT]], [[Zapier]], [[Make\|Integromat]],                    |
| 14:24      | which is now called Mac.                                          |
| 14:26      | There are a lot of these tools coming along now.                  |
| 14:29      | Yeah, and not only are they coming along,                         |
| 14:32      | I think people trust them more                                    |
| 14:34      | than they may have done previously.                               |
| 14:36      | And I think some of this is, you know,                            |
| 14:38      | just the march of time and the improvement of,                    |
| 14:41      | you know, generic availability of, you know,                      |
| 14:44      | you can trust a web system to be there.                           |
| 14:46      | But also I think some of it is just, you know,                    |
| 14:49      | people have become more familiar with the idea                    |
| 14:51      | of the internet doing things for you in the background,           |
| 14:54      | things you've configured, hopefully,                              |
| 14:56      | so that you can, you know, just get stuff done.                   |
| 14:59      | So things are not reliant on you happening.                       |
| 15:03      | And I think some of this maybe is,                                |
| 15:06      | or has been the pandemic to an extent,                            |
| 15:08      | because people have realised that, you know,                      |
| 15:11      | work doesn't stop when they go home                               |
| 15:13      | because they were already at home.                                |
| 15:15      | So maybe they can just make some stuff happen                     |
| 15:17      | in the background, or, you know,                                  |
| 15:19      | maybe it's just, you know,                                        |
| 15:21      | these tools have gotten more powerful,                            |
| 15:23      | which they certainly have.                                        |
| 15:24      | Yeah, and I also think that like, you know,                       |
| 15:25      | web tools are just a thing now.                                   |
| 15:28      | And it's increasingly a thing,                                    |
| 15:30      | not just for hobbyists and nerds like us,                         |
| 15:33      | but also people who go to work every day                          |
| 15:35      | and have to work, you know,                                       |
| 15:37      | web environments are becoming the collaborative platforms.        |
| 15:41      | And I think you're right partly because of COVID,                 |
| 15:43      | but I think that we are on that track already.                    |
| 15:45      | But now that we're using the web tools,                           |
| 15:47      | people want to automate them.                                     |
| 15:48      | And, you know, there is definitely an arms race                   |
| 15:52      | going on right now between competitors                            |
| 15:54      | to give us good automation tools for this stuff.                  |
| 15:57      | Exactly, yes.                                                     |
| 15:59      | And I have to say it's also great,                                |
| 16:01      | the number of web tools that have been created                    |
| 16:04      | because of web tools.                                             |
| 16:05      | So for example, [[Notion]].                                           |
| 16:06      | [[Notion]] is incredibly popular and for very good reasons.           |
| 16:10      | And they created an API.                                          |
| 16:12      | And then [[Alex Hay]], the creator of [[Toolbox Pro]],                 |
| 16:14      | created [[Nautomate]], which is a [[Notion]] automation tool,              |
| 16:18      | which just puts [[Notion]] actions inside of shortcuts for you.       |
| 16:22      | And that wouldn't exist if [[Notion]] didn't exist.                   |
| 16:25      | And [[Notion]] wouldn't have an API                                   |
| 16:27      | if people weren't so familiar with automation.                    |
| 16:30      | And I really feel like, you know,                                 |
| 16:31      | a lot of that is just people being aware of how much,             |
| 16:36      | you know, some automation can help them                           |
| 16:38      | even if they're not going, you know, full nerd automator          |
| 16:43      | and really begging for these features                             |
| 16:46      | and then these features happen,                                   |
| 16:47      | which means that developers use them                              |
| 16:49      | and more features happen because of that                          |
| 16:50      | and more people use it.                                           |
| 16:52      | And it's a lovely, wonderful, self-fulfilling circle.             |
| 16:55      | Yeah.                                                             |
| 16:56      | And I think the next category                                     |
| 16:57      | of frequently discussed topics on the show                        |
| 17:00      | in the first hundred episodes                                     |
| 17:01      | has been what I call unit-tasking automation.                     |
| 17:04      | Apps like [[Hazel]], Bunch, TextExpander,                             |
| 17:08      | the kind of apps that really are made to do one thing well        |
| 17:12      | and not taking away from what they do                             |
| 17:14      | because they do the one thing well.                               |
| 17:16      | That's why they've been discussed on the show.                    |
| 17:18      | But there is a kind of a growing crop of apps engineered          |
| 17:23      | around automating a specific problem.                             |
| 17:26      | Yes, yeah.                                                        |
| 17:27      | Like for example, PushCut is an app I am constantly using.        |
| 17:31      | I am never thinking about PushCut.                                |
| 17:33      | It's just there on an iPhone in my home running                   |
| 17:36      | and doing all the things for me.                                  |
| 17:38      | And you know what?                                                |
| 17:39      | That's great.                                                     |
| 17:40      | I love it because it does mean that stuff just happens            |
| 17:43      | that couldn't otherwise happen                                    |
| 17:44      | because a bunch of things run through shortcut sections           |
| 17:47      | and I don't have to run a Mac mini home server                    |
| 17:50      | to do those things.                                               |
| 17:52      | And it sort of bridges the gap between the web and local          |
| 17:56      | in some great ways, which is really useful to me.                 |
| 18:00      | When I wake up in the morning                                     |
| 18:01      | and my alarm clock plays music,                                   |
| 18:03      | that happens because of PushCut.                                  |
| 18:04      | Not because of anything else.                                     |
| 18:06      | It's because of PushCut that that's happening.                    |
| 18:08      | And that's great.                                                 |
| 18:10      | Yeah, all of those.                                               |
| 18:11      | I mean, and PushCut has emerged during the run of the show.       |
| 18:14      | Bunch came to an existence during the run of the show.            |
| 18:19      | [[Hazel]] and Texas have been around longer                           |
| 18:21      | but they both continue to thrive.                                 |
| 18:23      | I mean, those are absolute avenues of automation.                 |
| 18:28      | And then I guess the last category is I would just say scripts    |
| 18:32      | or scripting languages.                                           |
| 18:34      | AppleScript, JavaScript, Python.                                 |
| 18:37      | And we haven't covered those as in much detail                    |
| 18:40      | but we do link out to them quite often.                           |
| 18:42      | The problem with those is how do you explain                      |
| 18:45      | how to program code with a podcast                                |
| 18:47      | that's just really audio and stuff?                               |
| 18:48      | Yeah, yeah.                                                       |
| 18:49      | I mean, I could start reading the script that I wrote earlier     |
| 18:52      | from BS4 import beautiful soup                                    |
| 18:54      | but I really think people are just gonna go to sleep              |
| 18:56      | with that and that's no great.                                    |
| 18:57      | But it is certainly worth looking at                              |
| 19:00      | if you're looking for a different way to solve complex            |
| 19:05      | or tricky automation problems.                                    |
| 19:08      | Complex is the wrong word                                         |
| 19:10      | because sometimes it is just that,                                |
| 19:12      | you're getting data from a place                                  |
| 19:14      | where it's kind of difficult to wrangle                           |
| 19:16      | using [[Keyboard Maestro]] or Shortcuts or something.                 |
| 19:20      | And scripts really can just step up to the plate                  |
| 19:23      | and do what we need there.                                        |
| 19:24      | And that is truly great.                                          |
| 19:27      | Either way, we have had a lot of fodder                           |
| 19:30      | these first hundred episodes                                      |
| 19:31      | and some great categories of apps and services                    |
| 19:34      | to talk about automation with.                                    |
| 19:38      | This episode of Automators is brought to you                      |

| 19:41      | Sharing is caring, especially when it comes                       |
| 19:43      | to really important information                                   |
| 19:44      | that everybody needs to be able to get their hands on.            |
| 19:47      | There's nothing worse than somebody sitting around waiting        |
| 19:49      | because they needed to know something                             |
| 19:51      | but you went around to give it to them                            |
| 19:53      | or whoever it was that was the gatekeeper of the information      |
| 19:56      | didn't pass it along.                                             |
| 19:58      | If you're looking for a new way to track                          |
| 19:59      | and manage work and life from start to finish,                    |

| 20:06      | And it all starts at lists.live.com.                              |
| 20:09      | Microsoft kicked off a pre-brew program                           |
| 20:11      | to try lists with your Microsoft account                          |
| 20:13      | or design for small business and individual use.                  |
| 20:15      | Start by creating and sharing your lists                          |
| 20:17      | with your work colleagues, partners,                              |
| 20:18      | your soccer team or your neighbours.                               |
| 20:20      | You might create a list of books or movies                        |
| 20:22      | for your monthly meetings,                                        |
| 20:23      | track home improvement and important receipts                     |
| 20:25      | throughout the year,                                              |
| 20:26      | build up team rosters for your soccer or volunteer group          |
| 20:28      | or any number of other things.                                    |
| 20:30      | At lists.live.com,                                                |
| 20:32      | you can quickly get started with ready-made templates.            |
| 20:35      | Use filters and views to visualise your information,              |
| 20:37      | which means you can have one list with many views                 |
| 20:39      | and then you can share your lists as links                        |
| 20:41      | to get other people's thoughts and work together.                 |
| 20:44      | You can do a whole lot of this.                                   |
| 20:46      | The ready-made templates save you time                            |
| 20:48      | or start from scratch and add in exactly what                     |
| 20:50      | and how you want to track your information.                       |
| 20:53      | It's super flexible and grateful,                                 |
| 20:55      | gift ideas, issue trackers, event itineraries,                    |
| 20:58      | asset managers, work progress trackers,                           |
| 20:59      | receipt collection and much more.                                 |
| 21:02      | Personally, I've always got bits of information                   |
| 21:04      | that I need to share.                                             |
| 21:05      | Recently, I had to share some very specific documentation         |
| 21:08      | relating to specification at work,                                |
| 21:10      | but it varied depending on exactly what you were doing.           |
| 21:12      | So I created a whole bunch of information using a list            |
| 21:15      | and shared it with people and guess what?                         |
| 21:18      | Everybody seems happy                                             |
| 21:19      | and they've got the information they need.                        |

| 21:34      | Our thanks to Microsoft for their support of this show            |
| 21:36      | and all of Relay FM.                                              |
| 21:39      | So David, you asked me for some favourite automations              |
| 21:42      | when we were prepping for the show                                |
| 21:44      | because obviously we have favourites                               |
| 21:48      | or most frequently used automations,                              |
| 21:50      | but I'm curious, I'm gonna make you go first.                     |
| 21:53      | Tell me one of your favourites.                                    |
| 21:54      | Well, I mean, this is like picking children, right?               |
| 21:57      | You know, I'll tell you.                                          |
| 22:00      | So David, which child do you love the most                        |
| 22:03      | and is it really the dog?                                         |
| 22:04      | Yeah, I'll say almost anything I've done in [[Keyboard Maestro]]      |
| 22:09      | still brings me joy and delight                                   |
| 22:10      | because it is a great tool                                        |
| 22:12      | and I work at my Mac so much                                      |
| 22:15      | that that thing is always firing off,                             |
| 22:17      | but some of the stuff I've done with shortcuts                    |
| 22:20      | over the last couple of years around calendars                    |
| 22:23      | I have found to be really useful.                                 |
| 22:25      | And the shortcuts I believe is uniquely qualified                 |
| 22:29      | for calendar-based automation                                     |
| 22:31      | if you wanna create events or if you wanna do,                    |
| 22:34      | like one of the things, I do a lot of time blocking               |
| 22:37      | but sometimes things get set behind                               |
| 22:39      | and I've got a shortcut I wrote                                   |
| 22:40      | that automatically moves my remaining appointments                |
| 22:43      | back an hour and that is like so useful to me.                    |
| 22:47      | I have one that I wrote that allows me to go through,             |
| 22:52      | it'll look for events in the next week                            |
| 22:56      | and allow me to selectively choose them                           |
| 22:57      | to add a prep time to them                                        |
| 22:59      | because if I'm getting a phone call or an interview               |
| 23:02      | or something, I wanna put prep time on the calendar.              |
| 23:04      | And I don't put it on when I create the event                     |
| 23:07      | but as the event gets closer and it's not a difficult,            |
| 23:11      | it's a search the calendar, choose from list,                     |
| 23:16      | create an event and then you use some date and time math          |
| 23:20      | based on the start time of the event                              |
| 23:22      | and then just back up 30 minutes                                  |
| 23:24      | and make a new event starting at that new time                    |
| 23:27      | called prepare for.                                               |
| 23:28      | And then you grab the magic variable                              |
| 23:30      | for the name of the event                                         |
| 23:32      | and you can grab even like one of the things I do                 |
| 23:34      | is I haven't grabbed the specific calendar the event is in        |
| 23:37      | because I have so many different calendars.                       |
| 23:38      | So I can have the prep time                                       |
| 23:41      | get added to the appropriate calendar                             |
| 23:44      | and all this stuff, it took a little while                        |
| 23:46      | to kind of get it sorted the first time I set it up               |
| 23:48      | but I run these shortcuts like so often.                          |
| 23:52      | Another one I do is just it's just basic                          |
| 23:55      | looks at my calendar and pulls out a list                         |
| 23:59      | of the start time and the event name                              |
| 24:02      | of every event for the day                                        |
| 24:03      | and I run that shortcut every morning                             |
| 24:05      | and I drop it in [[Obsidian]]                                         |
| 24:08      | because I kind of keep a daily note in [[Obsidian]]                   |
| 24:11      | that shows what's the plan for the day.                           |
| 24:13      | And so I see what my plan was when the day starts                 |
| 24:16      | then as I go through the day,                                     |
| 24:17      | I adjust the calendar to match what I'm actually doing.           |
| 24:19      | It gives me a good kind of feedback loop                          |
| 24:22      | but sitting there typing out a list of my events every day        |
| 24:26      | that's bananas, you know what I mean?                             |
| 24:28      | And with shortcuts, this stuff is easy.                           |
| 24:30      | Now I could have done it with some clever AppleScript            |
| 24:33      | and [[Keyboard Maestro]],                                             |
| 24:34      | but shortcuts make stuff like this way easier.                    |
| 24:38      | And lately I've really been appreciating                          |
| 24:41      | my whole stack of calendar automations                            |
| 24:44      | I've generated in shortcuts over time.                            |
| 24:46      | Yeah, I bet I've been enhancing                                   |
| 24:49      | my guest podcast prep shortcut recently                           |
| 24:51      | because it asks me, it's actually a little bit sneaky             |
| 24:55      | because I somewhat frequently go on clockwise                     |
| 24:58      | or total party kill.                                              |
| 24:59      | So it's a little bit sneaky                                       |
| 25:00      | and I have a menu in there to choose                              |
| 25:03      | if I'm going on clockwise                                         |
| 25:04      | and then it'll pick like the upcoming clockwise episodes          |
| 25:06      | out of the Relay FM calendar from the live recording             |
| 25:10      | so that I could just use that date and time instead.              |
| 25:13      | And total party kill, obviously I need to do a little bit         |
| 25:17      | of prep with my D&D character for that                            |
| 25:18      | to make sure that I'm ready to go.                                |
| 25:21      | But that one goes through and adds a bunch of stuff               |
| 25:24      | to my calendar, including a prep event.                           |
| 25:25      | And the prep event is always scheduled                            |
| 25:27      | right before the podcast event                                    |
| 25:29      | but it doesn't actually have to stay there                        |
| 25:31      | and it frequently doesn't.                                        |
| 25:32      | I'll move it around maybe to a previous day                       |
| 25:34      | or a couple of hours before                                       |
| 25:36      | because I don't have to prep right before I do the episode.       |
| 25:40      | I just have to have prepped before the episode.                   |
| 25:43      | And of course, for me, it goes in and adds                        |
| 25:45      | [[OmniFocus]] projects for each one,                                  |
| 25:48      | including uploading the correct files afterwards                  |
| 25:51      | so that people have got decent audio.                             |
| 25:54      | But honestly, I went a little bit                                 |
| 25:57      | in a slightly different direction.                                |
| 25:58      | You said favourite automations.                                    |
| 26:00      | I decided to go for my favourite automators, automations           |
| 26:04      | because I've got a bunch of automations                           |
| 26:06      | based around the show.                                            |
| 26:07      | Our entire show notes are created                                 |
| 26:09      | thanks to automations combined with [[Airtable]].                     |
| 26:12      | So we put the episode into the [[Airtable]] record                    |
| 26:16      | and then bam, it goes ahead and creates a show doc for us         |
| 26:19      | and things like that.                                             |
| 26:21      | When I start recording the show,                                  |
| 26:23      | I activate my recording bunch for automators                      |
| 26:27      | and thanks to [[Audio Hijack\|Audio Hijack 4]].                                     |
| 26:30      | I now have Shortcuts, David,                                      |
| 26:31      | which opens specific [[Audio Hijack]] sessions for me.                |
| 26:34      | It's amazing.                                                     |
| 26:35      | And so I've got an [[AppleScript]] inside of that bunch              |
| 26:39      | which is tell application shortcuts.                                 |
| 26:41      | to run shortcuts, I think it's called                             |
| 26:43      | "Audio Hijack Automators Zoom".                                     |
| 26:45      | And then that opens the Automators Zoom session                   |
| 26:49      | in [[Audio Hijack]] for me, which is great.                           |
| 26:53      | And then I'm also tracking the time as we do the show             |
| 26:56      | so that I can insert show notes                                   |
| 26:59      | with actual timestamps for our editor.                            |
| 27:02      | That happens with [[Keyboard Maestro]]                                |
| 27:05      | because when I start recording,                                   |
| 27:06      | I use [[Keyboard Maestro]] to start the recording.                    |
| 27:08      | It saves the timestamp into a variable                            |
| 27:10      | and it activates [[Audio Hijack]]                                     |
| 27:13      | and hits the recording keyboard shortcut.                         |
| 27:15      | I should probably change that out to a different automation       |
| 27:17      | now that [[Audio Hijack]] has automations,                            |
| 27:19      | but it ain't broke so I'm probably not gonna                      |
| 27:22      | invest all that much time fixing it.                              |
| 27:24      | And then of course there's the after show stuff                   |
| 27:26      | where [[Keyboard Maestro]] will manage my files for me                |
| 27:29      | in that it, because it asks me                                    |
| 27:32      | when I start recording the show,                                  |
| 27:33      | which episode we're recording.                                    |
| 27:35      | When I activate the bunch to be precise,                          |
| 27:37      | it asks me which episode that is.                                 |
| 27:39      | So I typed in for this show, episode 100.                         |
| 27:42      | Yay, very exciting.                                               |
| 27:43      | And then what it does after that is it goes                       |
| 27:45      | and creates that episode folder in the folder                     |
| 27:48      | for our editor so that we have a folder for that episode.         |
| 27:52      | And then when I'm done recording,                                 |
| 27:54      | it's watching that folder where all those files go                |
| 27:56      | and it knows how I name my files and it looks for them            |
| 27:59      | and it renames them so that the episode number is in there        |
| 28:02      | and puts them inside the episode folder, which is great.          |
| 28:05      | And of course, when guests come on the show,                      |
| 28:07      | their files get uploaded and [[Keyboard Maestro]] pops up             |
| 28:10      | and goes, hey, you go rename this file                            |
| 28:13      | and tell me which episode this is for                             |
| 28:14      | and I'm gonna go put it in the right place for you.               |
| 28:16      | And when I record the ads and things,                             |
| 28:19      | those also pop up after I'm done with the recording the file      |
| 28:23      | and goes, hey, which ad is this and things like that              |
| 28:26      | to make sure that all the files get in there correctly named      |
| 28:29      | because they need to be in there right.                           |
| 28:32      | And honestly, there's a whole suite                               |
| 28:34      | of automation tools involved in here and I love it                |
| 28:37      | and I don't think it would be so easy to record the show          |
| 28:41      | if it wasn't for them and let's face it,                          |
| 28:43      | it's a great way to fiddle with some of these things              |
| 28:45      | and have some fun whilst also preparing for the show.             |
| 28:48      | Yeah, I mean, you're using cloud-based automation                 |
| 28:50      | and local Mac-based automation.                                   |
| 28:53      | You're kind of covering the whole gamut of the show               |
| 28:56      | with that one stack.                                              |
| 28:58      | Yeah, yeah, I really am.                                          |
| 29:00      | It feels like nearly everything that I do                         |
| 29:05      | is like one of the apps that is mentioned                         |
| 29:09      | and almost frequently talked about tools.                         |
| 29:11      | Like [[Drafts]] is even in there                                      |
| 29:12      | because what happens when an episode goes into the planning       |
| 29:17      | and our show notes are created,                                   |
| 29:21      | it also pangs my push cut notification                            |
| 29:24      | or push cut server, which means that it goes                      |
| 29:27      | and creates a draft for me for that episode.                      |
| 29:29      | So I've got a quick way to dump any thoughts                      |
| 29:31      | that I have into a draft for that episode really easily           |
| 29:35      | and when the episode releases, that runs another shortcut,        |
| 29:38      | which among other things, queues up some tweets                   |
| 29:41      | and things like that about the forum and so on and so forth,      |
| 29:44      | but it also tells push cut to run the draft section               |
| 29:49      | with a particular episode number                                  |
| 29:51      | which goes and archives the draft for that episode                |
| 29:53      | and that's just magic.                                            |
| 29:55      | What were some of your favourite content shows                     |
| 29:58      | of the first hundred?                                             |
| 29:59      | We often talk about, we kind of have two shows here,              |
| 30:03      | we do a guest show, we do content shows.                          |
| 30:06      | I can tell you, I'll give you a minute                            |
| 30:07      | because I just kind of dropped this on you,                       |
| 30:09      | it's on our line.                                                 |
| 30:09      | You did, you did.                                                 |
| 30:11      | I do, like for me, I like a lot of the ones                       |
| 30:13      | that are kind of more general,                                    |
| 30:15      | like we've done shows on like email and calendar                  |
| 30:18      | and like I really like those shows                                |
| 30:20      | and since I feel like someone listening                           |
| 30:22      | could probably find a way to use something immediately            |
| 30:26      | in that.                                                          |
| 30:27      | But I also do like, I also like the nerdy ones                    |
| 30:31      | where we take like four or five topics in one                     |
| 30:33      | and just kind of go down the rabbit hole on them.                 |
| 30:36      | So, but I guess if I had to pick,                                 |
| 30:38      | I'd say I think the general shows,                                |
| 30:40      | I think are some of my favourites.                                 |
| 30:44      | Honestly, I'm going to go with not content                        |
| 30:46      | but the guest shows because every single guest                    |
| 30:49      | we've had on has surprised me                                     |
| 30:50      | and I mean that in a good way to be clear.                        |
| 30:53      | Every single person that's come on,                               |
| 30:54      | I found out different things I didn't know                        |
| 30:57      | or a different way of doing things.                               |
| 30:58      | And I love the fact that, you know,                               |
| 31:01      | you and I are the automation experts.                             |
| 31:03      | I'm using air quotes here and we learn things                     |
| 31:06      | from our guests and I really love that.                           |
| 31:10      | The fact that, you know, so many people                           |
| 31:12      | have got so many different ways of doing things                   |
| 31:14      | and they're solving problems in creative, nerdy ways.             |
| 31:17      | It makes me feel great.                                           |
| 31:19      | And I really love the fact that, you know,                        |
| 31:21      | I get ideas every time, you know,                                 |
| 31:23      | somebody comes on the show to talk about things.                  |
| 31:25      | It's, yeah, that's one of my favourites, I think.                  |
| 31:27      | I was going to ask you, you know,                                 |
| 31:28      | what's your favourite guests and that this is not possible.        |
| 31:33      | I mean, I'm just looking through all the people.                  |
| 31:35      | I think we might insult people if we don't pick them.             |
| 31:38      | So I'm just going to go with everybody                            |
| 31:40      | because everybody has been my favourite guest.                     |
| 31:42      | I mean, it's not even like an attempt to not be insulting         |
| 31:45      | but like I'm like, [[Matthew Cassinelli\|Matt Cassinelli]], [[Dr Drang]],                    |
| 31:48      | [[Ryan J A Murphy]].                                                |
| 31:49      | [[Jason Snell]].                                                      |
| 31:50      | I mean, it's like, you just look through the list                 |
| 31:52      | and they're all great automators.                                 |
| 31:54      | We've had some really excellent guests.                           |
| 31:56      | That's one thing for the next 200 shows.                          |
| 31:58      | I want to make sure we can keep that quality up                   |
| 32:00      | because we've got some great ones.                                |
| 32:01      | Oh yeah, yes.                                                     |
| 32:03      | And also, you know, in the next 200,                              |
| 32:06      | I'm hoping that we can get more of our listeners in               |
| 32:09      | because we know that our listeners, you know,                     |
| 32:11      | have so many great people.                                        |
| 32:12      | You're listening to the show.                                     |
| 32:13      | You have so many great automations.                               |
| 32:16      | Please do feel free, share them in our forums,                    |
| 32:18      | tweet at us, et cetera.                                           |
| 32:20      | But hopefully we can get some more of them on the show            |
| 32:22      | as well in the future, David,                                     |
| 32:23      | because it is really great when, you know,                        |
| 32:26      | somebody hears something we've said                               |
| 32:28      | and finds a better way to do it                                   |
| 32:29      | or a different way to do it,                                      |
| 32:31      | or they're solving another problem                                |
| 32:34      | when we inspired them to a solution                               |
| 32:36      | with something that we said.                                      |
| 32:38      | I love hearing about that.                                        |
| 32:39      | I can tell you by far the funnest episode for me                  |
| 32:42      | of the first 100,                                                 |
| 32:43      | which is when a lot of people didn't get access to.               |
| 32:45      | It's the member special,                                          |
| 32:47      | where we played Mousetrap on Sal Soghoianan's kitchen table.         |
| 32:50      | Oh God.                                                           |
| 32:51      | Yeah, that was so much fun.                                       |
| 32:54      | And if you are a member,                                          |
| 32:56      | we should mention that the membership month                       |
| 32:58      | is coming up again.                                               |
| 32:59      | And if you are a member,                                          |
| 33:01      | not only do you get Automators Max every week,                    |
| 33:02      | but you'll also get that bonus episode                            |
| 33:07      | where we will be doing it again this year.                        |
| 33:08      | I haven't told David this until just now.                         |
| 33:10      | So, you know, if he sounds surprised for the next few minutes,    |
| 33:13      | you know why,                                                     |
| 33:14      | but we will be doing another Mousetrap episode                    |
| 33:16      | if you get access to last year.                                   |
| 33:17      | We've got to figure out.                                          |
| 33:18      | I mean, how do you overcome?                                      |
| 33:19      | I don't think we can ever be playing Mousetrap with Sal,          |
| 33:22      | but, you know, we'll find something fun.                          |
| 33:25      | We'll see what we can do.                                         |
| 33:26      | But, you know, there was even video of that.                      |
| 33:30      | So you get to watch us play Mousetrap on video                    |
| 33:33      | with Sal and his lovely wife, Naomi, as well,                     |
| 33:35      | who was fortunately more than happy to lend us there.             |
| 33:39      | They were happy to lend us their kitchen table                    |
| 33:41      | so we could play that and record it.                              |
| 33:44      | And J.F. Brisette came and did our audio for us,                   |
| 33:46      | which was lovely.                                                 |
| 33:47      | And yeah, it is always fun to do something                        |
| 33:50      | that takes us somewhere totally unexpected.                       |
| 33:53      | So I'm hoping that we get some more of those, you know,           |
| 33:56      | that frequently happens in the guest episodes.                    |
| 33:58      | We end up somewhere unexpected and wonderful.                     |
| 34:01      | All right, so having done a hundred episodes                      |
| 34:03      | and spent some time thinking about automation,                    |
| 34:06      | what do you see as the current trends in all of this stuff?       |
| 34:09      | Where do you see this stuff kind of moving right now?             |
| 34:13      | I mean, it's one of those things where obviously                  |
| 34:15      | I have an inherent bias towards what I'm doing                    |
| 34:19      | as, you know, what the trends are,                                |
| 34:22      | but also from what I'm seeing,                                    |
| 34:24      | there's just a lot more automation in places.                     |
| 34:27      | People are expecting things to exist and to happen.               |
| 34:33      | But for me personally, I've definitely seen an increase           |
| 34:36      | in crossing the streams, Ghostbusters style,                      |
| 34:39      | you know, where you've thought about it a little bit,             |
| 34:41      | or maybe not, and then I end up, you know,                        |
| 34:43      | putting AppleScript inside of a shortcut,                         |
| 34:46      | or running a shortcut through AppleScript inside a bunch,         |
| 34:50      | which is actually run by [[Keyboard Maestro]] from my [[Stream Deck]].    |
| 34:54      | And so I've ended up kind of nesting automation types             |
| 34:57      | and crossing streams in ways which I feel                         |
| 35:00      | can only be beneficial, the fact that, you know,                  |
| 35:03      | maybe I can't do everything in one tool,                          |
| 35:04      | or I started out in this tool                                     |
| 35:06      | and I don't want to move everything over                          |
| 35:07      | and waste all my time doing that.                                 |
| 35:09      | So I can just leave that stuff in that tool                       |
| 35:11      | and continue on in something more powerful                        |
| 35:13      | and not lose everything that I started with.                      |
| 35:16      | And I think that is a trend which, you know,                      |
| 35:20      | I'm seeing in a lot of places, you know,                          |
| 35:23      | somebody tweeted at us a little while ago                         |
| 35:26      | to say that they've used their first AppleScript,                 |
| 35:28      | which they copied and pasted it into a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro.    |
| 35:32      | And, you know, and that is great.                                 |
| 35:35      | I'm really thrilled that more people are doing things like that   |
| 35:38      | because I feel like it's more accessible in many ways             |
| 35:41      | when you can just go, right,                                      |
| 35:43      | well, [[Keyboard Maestro]], for example,                              |
| 35:45      | can do everything I need except this little bit,                  |
| 35:47      | but AppleScript can do that.                                      |
| 35:48      | And this person wrote a script,                                   |
| 35:49      | which I can read because it's AppleScript.                        |
| 35:51      | So I know what it's doing because it's just words.                |
| 35:53      | So I'll just copy and paste that                                  |
| 35:55      | and put that in this [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro                       |
| 35:56      | or put this in the shortcut                                       |
| 35:58      | and then it does the whole thing for you.                         |
| 35:59      | And that is something I love.                                     |
| 36:01      | Yeah, I agree.                                                    |
| 36:02      | I think another trend is just the simplification                  |
| 36:05      | and democratisation of automation.                                |
| 36:09      | I mean, things are just easier than they were                     |
| 36:11      | when we even started this show.                                   |
| 36:13      | And for instance, on the Mac,                                     |
| 36:16      | as we get shortcuts for Mac kind of gets more stable.             |
| 36:20      | And we're going to talk about [[WWDC]] later,                         |
| 36:22      | but I feel like it's going to get more stable.                    |
| 36:25      | We're seeing increasingly applications                            |
| 36:28      | that were not historically automation friendly                    |
| 36:31      | become automation friendly.                                       |
| 36:32      | You mentioned earlier, [[Audio Hijack]],                              |
| 36:36      | the last version of [[Audio Hijack]]                                  |
| 36:37      | didn't have any automation in it,                                 |
| 36:38      | but now that shortcuts exist,                                     |
| 36:40      | they were able to put something together.                         |
| 36:42      | And if you look at the just shocking number of Mac apps           |
| 36:48      | that are getting shortcut support,                                |
| 36:51      | you can see that there's a whole avenue of automation             |
| 36:54      | available to users that wasn't there before.                      |
| 36:58      | And I think that's going to make it a lot easier                  |
| 37:00      | for people to build two to five step shortcuts                    |
| 37:04      | that solves a little problem for them.                            |
| 37:06      | It's not super complex and because it's not complex,              |
| 37:09      | it's not going to break.                                          |
| 37:11      | And they're just going to quietly use that automation.            |
| 37:14      | And I think that's something that I really like                   |
| 37:18      | that's happening.                                                 |
| 37:19      | Yes, yeah, it really is great.                                    |
| 37:22      | My parents have both got shortcuts on their home screens,         |
| 37:24      | which in fairness, I created for them.                            |
| 37:27      | And so, they didn't necessarily make them themselves,             |
| 37:31      | but my mom messaged me the other day and said,                    |
| 37:33      | hey, you know that parking thing?                                 |
| 37:35      | How can I make it also work for this other car park               |
| 37:39      | when I'm at this other car park?                                  |
| 37:41      | And it's like, you're actually using this stuff,                  |
| 37:44      | which is great.                                                   |
| 37:45      | And the fact that I was able to just put something                |
| 37:47      | on your home screen that solves a problem for you                 |
| 37:50      | is really good.                                                   |
| 37:51      | So, I've duplicated her shortcut                                  |
| 37:54      | and given her a different one for another car park.               |
| 37:57      | I did offer to put a menu in there,                               |
| 37:58      | but she didn't want the extra menu.                               |
| 38:00      | She just wanted to set the button                                 |
| 38:01      | and have it do that car park for her.                             |
| 38:03      | So, there we go, that's that problem solved.                      |
| 38:06      | But it really is, you know,                                       |
| 38:07      | automation appearing in all the places.                           |
| 38:09      | You know, as I mentioned before,                                  |
| 38:10      | [[Notion]] added an API because of user demand.                       |
| 38:13      | [[Obsidian]] has things like data view and, you know,                 |
| 38:18      | custom JS as options and you can just write plugins for it        |
| 38:22      | because users want that.                                          |
| 38:25      | And I'm sure some of these plugins were created                   |
| 38:27      | because that person who created it wanted them                    |
| 38:30      | and they've grown beyond their original creator.                  |
| 38:33      | And that, you know, that really to me is a sign                   |
| 38:35      | that automation is, you know,                                     |
| 38:37      | something that people are perhaps less scared of                  |
| 38:40      | than they previously were.                                        |
| 38:42      | And maybe that some of this is just people getting better         |
| 38:46      | to grips with computers in general.                               |
| 38:49      | Maybe some of it is just, you know,                               |
| 38:52      | the fact that they've seen it in enough places                    |
| 38:54      | that they trust it.                                               |
| 38:55      | I don't know, but either way, I like what I'm seeing there.       |

| 39:53      | and delegate boring repeating tasks.                              |
| 39:56      | We're automators, we love automation, so does DEVONthink.         |
| 39:59      | DEVONthink's AppleScript dictionary                               |
| 40:01      | is one of the largest on the Mac.                                 |
| 40:02      | There's no part of DEVONthink that can't be automated.            |
| 40:05      | And because the app has such a rich history on the Mac,           |
| 40:07      | there are so many existing AppleScripts                           |
| 40:10      | that have been written to make DEVONthink work harder for you.    |
| 40:12      | You can extend DEVONthink's functionality                         |
| 40:14      | with your own commands by adding them to its scripts menu.        |
| 40:17      | Even templates can have scripts inside                            |
| 40:19      | and you can set up new documents with data from placeholders      |
| 40:23      | or inserted by your own AppleScript code.                         |
| 40:25      | And of course, there's so much more                               |
| 40:27      | from an iOS companion app to email archiving, scanning            |
| 40:31      | and even an embedded web server                                   |
| 40:33      | for you sharing your data securely with your team.                |
| 40:35      | I'm a big DEVONthink devotee,                                     |
| 40:38      | I use it for a lot of my data,                                    |
| 40:40      | all my personal stuff is in there.                                |
| 40:42      | I've got a bunch of my legacy legal stuff in there                |
| 40:45      | and I've got MacSparky stuff in there.                           |
| 40:46      | In fact, I made a DEVONthink field guide                          |
| 40:48      | because I love it so much.                                        |
| 40:49      | I just find it so useful because it's so powerful.                |
| 40:52      | Not only does it have the automation tools built in,              |
| 40:55      | it also has amazing support for linking.                          |
| 40:57      | You can link to anything in your DEVONthink library               |
| 41:00      | with an easily-created link right in the application.             |
| 41:03      | And you can drop that anywhere else                               |
| 41:04      | and then suddenly you've got contextual computing.                |
| 41:07      | You're jumping around your Mac                                    |
| 41:08      | and into your DEVONthink library and out of it very easily.       |
| 41:12      | Anybody that's interested about managing big bits of data         |
| 41:15      | on their Mac should check out DEVONthink.                         |

| 41:34      | for their support of the Automators and Olive Relay FM.           |
| 41:39      | So Rose, we got news.                                             |
| 41:40      | It's the last time we were on air.                                |
| 41:42      | [[WWDC]] June 6th, not that far off.                                  |
| 41:46      | Nope, no, it's really not.                                        |
| 41:47      | Time is taking away at a relatively rapid pace.                   |
| 41:51      | But I reckon, David, do you think if we wish hard enough          |
| 41:55      | and talk about all the things that we want,                       |
| 41:57      | Apple have got time?                                              |
| 41:58      | Like from my counting, they've got like six weeks until.          |
| 42:01      | Sure, they can just add all that in, why not?                     |
| 42:04      | Yeah, yeah, yeah.                                                 |
| 42:05      | I mean, okay, by the time this episode releases,                  |
| 42:07      | they'll have like four weeks.                                     |
| 42:09      | Or yeah, with the holidays and everything built in.               |
| 42:12      | But I think there's time.                                         |
| 42:14      | I think there's time, you know, they're smart people.             |
| 42:16      | All right, so from a shortcuts                                    |
| 42:19      | or just an automation perspective,                                |
| 42:22      | what would you like to see happen this year at [[WWDC]]?              |
| 42:26      | I would like to see four specific automation actions              |
| 42:31      | that are come from shortcuts.                                     |
| 42:33      | For example, the vibrate action.                                  |
| 42:35      | I would love to just have a global preference                     |
| 42:39      | for ignore actions that cannot run on this,                       |
| 42:42      | like ignore device actions that cannot be executed                |
| 42:44      | on this platform.                                                 |
| 42:45      | So that if there is a vibrate action                              |
| 42:47      | in my shortcut, for example,                                      |
| 42:50      | because I created it thinking I was gonna run it                  |
| 42:51      | on my iPhone and then I try and run it on my Mac,                 |
| 42:54      | it doesn't just crash and stop.                                   |
| 42:55      | Because on my Mac, I've set a preference                          |
| 42:58      | to ignore device actions that cannot be executed                  |
| 43:02      | on this device.                                                   |
| 43:04      | Now, this doesn't mean that, for example, say,                    |
| 43:07      | if OmniFocus adds an action on iOS                                |
| 43:11      | and then it comes to the Mac a day later                          |
| 43:12      | because it takes me a little while to install the update,         |
| 43:16      | that that should just keep going                                  |
| 43:18      | because obviously that's going to be very different.              |
| 43:20      | But I feel like device specific things                            |
| 43:23      | like that vibrate action and stuff really ought to just,          |
| 43:28      | you know, not crash my shortcut                                   |
| 43:30      | or me have the ability to not crash my shortcut.                  |
| 43:33      | And we have some precedence for this in shortcuts.                |
| 43:35      | If you look in the preferences for shortcuts,                     |
| 43:38      | then you can turn on allow running scripts,                       |
| 43:42      | allow sharing large amounts of data,                              |
| 43:43      | allow deleting without confirmation,                              |
| 43:44      | allow deleting with large amounts of data.                        |
| 43:47      | So please, can I have a checkbox                                  |
| 43:50      | for ignore device actions                                         |
| 43:53      | which are not compatible with this device?                        |
| 43:56      | Make it a toggle on my iPhone, a checkbox on my Mac,              |
| 44:00      | and just let me ignore the vibrate action in particular.          |
| 44:03      | But there's a couple of different ones in there                   |
| 44:05      | which all do that sort of thing                                   |
| 44:08      | where it just doesn't work, unfortunately.                        |
| 44:10      | Yeah, I would like to even just state that request                |
| 44:13      | more generally and have Apple just get better                     |
| 44:16      | at device conflicts, you know?                                    |
| 44:18      | Mm-hmm.                                                           |
| 44:19      | You know, now that you've got shortcuts                           |
| 44:21      | and multiple platforms as users,                                  |
| 44:23      | we're hitting these conflicts where, you know,                    |
| 44:25      | people want to call something that on the Mac                     |
| 44:30      | that's not on the iPhone or whatever.                             |
| 44:31      | And it doesn't deal with that elegantly,                          |
| 44:35      | you know, the perfect solution would be,                          |
| 44:37      | we'll find a way to make an alternative.                          |
| 44:39      | I mean, we talked about the vibrate,                              |
| 44:40      | I think in the last episode with [[Federico Viticci\|Federico]] and [[John Voorhees\|John]],               |
| 44:43      | but like I was thinking, well, instead of vibrating,              |
| 44:46      | have the screen flash or do something, you know?                  |
| 44:48      | And just figure out an equivalent and just do that.               |
| 44:53      | Yes.                                                              |
| 44:54      | I think that would be the most elegant solution                   |
| 44:56      | but the current one where it just breaks                          |
| 44:58      | and doesn't even tell you what went wrong,                        |
| 45:00      | that's currently the worst solution.                              |
| 45:03      | It really is and things like get battery level, okay?             |
| 45:06      | So I'm running this on my Mac Studio, okay?                       |
| 45:08      | I ran the get battery level shortcut                              |
| 45:11      | and or shortcut action and it outputs a zero,                     |
| 45:14      | which I will give you is technically correct                      |
| 45:16      | because my Mac Studio has no battery,                             |
| 45:20      | but maybe it could, you know, return a 100 or something           |
| 45:25      | because technically it's always full power                        |
| 45:28      | because it's a desktop, it doesn't have a battery                 |
| 45:32      | or different idea, I could turn the battery level of my UPS,      |
| 45:37      | but, you know, that's perhaps going a bit too far.                |
| 45:39      | But yeah, it would be really great to have things like that       |
| 45:42      | and also things like a switch case instead of just if else.       |
| 45:48      | So a switch case, you've got one condition                        |
| 45:50      | and then you switch on the condition                              |
| 45:52      | so that I could say, okay, if the device is my Mac Studio,        |
| 45:57      | do this, if it's my iPad Pro, do this,                            |
| 45:59      | if it's my iPad Mini, do this,                                    |
| 46:00      | and if it's my iPhone, do this.                                   |
| 46:02      | And not just being able to switch on device name,                 |
| 46:07      | but also being able to switch on any number of things             |
| 46:12      | so I could put my own text in there or my own variables           |
| 46:15      | or whatever it is that I need to do.                              |
| 46:17      | And you can work around this sometimes                            |
| 46:18      | kind of with a dictionary,                                        |
| 46:19      | if you just want to get different text results                    |
| 46:22      | based on an input text result, then you can say, okay,            |
| 46:25      | so if it's like build a dictionary with keys and values           |
| 46:28      | and then you can just if through it or repeat                     |
| 46:31      | with each through it and say,                                     |
| 46:32      | if it contains this then the output is this,                      |
| 46:34      | otherwise nothing and just see what you get back.                 |
| 46:37      | But it's tricky and I feel like a switch                          |
| 46:41      | would probably help a lot of people understand                    |
| 46:46      | some of this stuff more                                           |
| 46:47      | because when they try to do an if                                 |
| 46:50      | and then they need to put another if inside of it,                |
| 46:54      | they end up indenting things,                                     |
| 46:56      | especially if you're on a small iPhone,                           |
| 46:58      | that's really tricky, whereas a switch is one level               |
| 47:02      | and maybe go a step further and add and                           |
| 47:05      | so you can have multiple conditions or something                  |
| 47:07      | that would be really great,                                       |
| 47:08      | but yeah, it would be lovely to have a switch case.               |
| 47:11      | Yeah, and if statements are fine,                                 |
| 47:13      | but you kind of nailed it at the end there,                       |
| 47:15      | if statements on a device where you've got to use                 |
| 47:17      | your fingers to like move blocks around                           |
| 47:20      | and it's very precarious sometimes on smaller screens,            |
| 47:24      | it gets really difficult                                          |
| 47:25      | and that kind of gets to something I'd like to see                |
| 47:29      | and really your request fits inside this,                         |
| 47:32      | the idea of dealing with the multiple devices better,             |
| 47:35      | but just a general cleanup of the existing tools and actions      |
| 47:41      | and just like get rid of a lot of the friction points             |
| 47:44      | and by friction points,                                           |
| 47:46      | I mean everything from how hard is it                             |
| 47:48      | to keep your shortcuts in order in a folder.                      |
| 47:53      | Just this morning, I was organising some in a folder              |
| 47:56      | and then it just randomly scrambled its eggs,                     |
| 47:59      | and then, or how do you get text in easier                        |
| 48:03      | or how do you rename a variable?                                  |
| 48:05      | Like there's a bunch of stuff in there that works,                |
| 48:08      | but it always requires like,                                      |
| 48:10      | almost it feels like insider knowledge                            |
| 48:12      | to know where the dragons are                                     |
| 48:15      | and just kill all those dragons                                   |
| 48:17      | and make it so just it's much easier.                             |
| 48:20      | Getting back to my idea earlier of saying,                        |
| 48:22      | a lot of people wanna do two to five step shortcuts,              |
| 48:25      | make this app so stable and rock solid                            |
| 48:28      | that nobody making a two to five step shortcut                    |
| 48:31      | is going to run into a problem.                                   |
| 48:33      | I understand it, if you're a power user                           |
| 48:35      | and you wanna make a hundred steps,                               |
| 48:37      | we're gonna have some problems,                                   |
| 48:38      | but make it so people on that entry ramp                          |
| 48:41      | don't have any problems                                           |
| 48:43      | and don't redo the user interface, just keep it,                  |
| 48:47      | but just make all the stuff under the hood                        |
| 48:49      | work a little better.                                             |
| 48:52      | Yes, speaking of things working a little better,                  |
| 48:55      | I would love to see, for example,                                 |
| 49:00      | when I open a shortcut that I edited,                             |
| 49:02      | it not tell me that it was edited                                 |
| 49:04      | on my iPhone's name, brackets, this device,                       |
| 49:07      | and my iPhone's name.                                             |
| 49:08      | No, no, no, at the same time, even, at the same time,             |
| 49:12      | because I don't know,                                             |
| 49:13      | like I don't know what is happening there,                        |
| 49:15      | but something weird is happening                                  |
| 49:17      | and also related to that on the shortcut front,                   |
| 49:21      | tap targets are so off.                                           |
| 49:23      | If I pick something up and try to drop it,                        |
| 49:26      | it's a good, like three quarters of an inch above my finger.      |
| 49:29      | It's like two centimeters or more above my finger                 |
| 49:33      | or below my finger sometimes.                                     |
| 49:35      | And this happens on the Mac too,                                  |
| 49:36      | with dragging and dropping actions,                               |
| 49:38      | with the mouse sometimes, it just is totally off.                 |
| 49:41      | And I think it's related to when you expand an action             |
| 49:46      | to get more information and then fold it up again,                |
| 49:49      | like that seems to be for me the trigger.                         |
| 49:52      | And I have filed that in the feedback                             |
| 49:53      | and hopefully it's landed in the right place.                     |
| 49:57      | But that is the sort of thing that puts people off so much.       |
| 50:02      | And it puts me off as well,                                       |
| 50:04      | like it's really difficult when I'm trying to edit something      |
| 50:07      | and I go to drop an action                                        |
| 50:08      | and I can't even see where it's gonna drop it.                    |
| 50:12      | And so I just let it go                                           |
| 50:14      | and that action just has disappeared entirely                     |
| 50:16      | and it's very frustrating for me as a pro user,                   |
| 50:20      | let alone for somebody who's just trying to create                |
| 50:22      | like two or three actions                                         |
| 50:23      | and their friend who's looking over their shoulder says,          |
| 50:25      | oh, you put this in the wrong order,                              |
| 50:26      | drag this one above that one.                                     |
| 50:28      | And they have to like think two centimeters                       |
| 50:30      | above their finger at the entire time.                            |
| 50:32      | It's kind of crazy.                                               |
| 50:34      | Yeah, those problems are so common to me                          |
| 50:36      | that I've almost forgot that they exist as problems.              |
| 50:39      | I've just kind of accepted that they're part of life,             |
| 50:41      | that every time I open a shortcut,                                |
| 50:43      | I haven't opened for a while,                                     |
| 50:44      | it's gonna give me a conflict.                                    |
| 50:46      | And it doesn't even make sense why the conflict is,               |
| 50:48      | it's usually on the same device.                                  |
| 50:50      | And I always pick the top one                                     |
| 50:52      | and I don't know what just happened,                              |
| 50:55      | but I just go with it.                                            |
| 50:56      | And then the same thing is not only a touch target being off      |
| 50:59      | but also just the land target being off.                          |
| 51:02      | Like when you do touch it and get in the right spot,              |
| 51:04      | like if you hold it between action steps one and two,             |
| 51:09      | the gap will open up between three and four.                      |
| 51:12      | And so you have to pay attention to where the gap is,             |
| 51:16      | even though your mouse isn't there.                               |
| 51:17      | And those are things that for people,                             |
| 51:19      | I mean, for you and me, we just kind of roll with it.             |
| 51:22      | We understand and we kind of figure it out                        |
| 51:24      | how to get around that.                                           |
| 51:25      | But I mean, for people trying to get used to this stuff,          |
| 51:28      | I mean, that is such a turn off, right?                           |
| 51:31      | I mean...                                                         |
| 51:32      | It is, it really is.                                              |
| 51:34      | And it's just frustrating as well.                                |
| 51:38      | The other thing that I would really love to see                   |
| 51:42      | is action name aliases,                                           |
| 51:45      | where they don't have to show us the names of,                    |
| 51:48      | or the alternative names to certain actions.                      |
| 51:50      | But you know what happens right now?                              |
| 51:51      | If I type exit into the actions list in shortcuts,                |
| 51:57      | nothing, I get nothing back.                                      |
| 51:59      | Previously, I would have got exit shortcut back,                  |
| 52:02      | but it's now called stop shortcut and stop shortcut and output.   |
| 52:06      | But if I search for exit,                                         |
| 52:07      | which is a common word in programming languages                   |
| 52:09      | that people probably picked up over the years,                    |
| 52:12      | I know my mom would ask, how do you exit this thing?              |
| 52:15      | Rather than stop it,                                              |
| 52:17      | she might search for stop as a second one.                        |
| 52:19      | But if they search for exit,                                      |
| 52:20      | then it might be nice to have like alternative suggestions        |
| 52:26      | as an area, like where Siri,                                      |
| 52:28      | when you search for something comes back with,                    |
| 52:30      | these are the results and then,                                   |
| 52:32      | here are some other things and on the web.                        |
| 52:34      | Well, just like you've got on the web,                            |
| 52:35      | have alternative suggestions                                      |
| 52:37      | and stop shortcut could appear in there                           |
| 52:40      | and allow app developers to give you alternative names            |
| 52:44      | as well that you can search for.                                  |
| 52:46      | Because that would be just really nice to have.                   |
| 52:51      | Because then, for example,                                        |
| 52:53      | I've got a friend who was looking to get the number from,         |
| 52:57      | or get a number from input,                                       |
| 52:59      | but he didn't know he was looking for get number from input.      |
| 53:01      | He looked for like parse integer because he's a developer.        |
| 53:05      | So of course he looked for parsing an integer                     |
| 53:06      | because that's what he wanted.                                    |
| 53:08      | But he didn't realise that get number from input                  |
| 53:10      | was actually what he needed.                                      |
| 53:11      | Well, maybe parse could be an alias to get or similar             |
| 53:16      | and just make some suggestions that way.                          |
| 53:18      | Because again, for people who are already developers              |
| 53:22      | or power users, this is helpful,                                  |
| 53:24      | but it's also helpful for the people                              |
| 53:25      | who don't know what they're doing,                                |
| 53:27      | where they can just search for the thing                          |
| 53:30      | and it'll give them actions.                                      |
| 53:33      | If I type in OF,                                                  |
| 53:34      | it would be great to have OmniFocus actions appear.               |
| 53:36      | And if OmniFocus could suggest that an alternative                |
| 53:39      | to OmniFocus is OF and [[OmniGraffle]] is OG                          |
| 53:43      | and OmniPlan is OP, et cetera,                                    |
| 53:45      | then that would probably be really helpful                        |
| 53:48      | for the users of those apps.                                      |
| 53:49      | And I'm sure that it would make it just a little bit easier       |
| 53:55      | for users and probably make life a little bit easier              |
| 54:00      | for app developers as well from the support side                  |
| 54:02      | where they don't have to explain                                  |
| 54:04      | no, no, no, it won't appear if you search for this,               |
| 54:06      | you need to search for that                                       |
| 54:07      | or go into the app list inside of shortcuts                       |
| 54:11      | and then go to the app actions.                                   |
| 54:12      | Okay, and so on that point of making it easier                    |
| 54:15      | for developers, I think that's the next piece                     |
| 54:18      | of this request for simplification.                               |
| 54:21      | I feel like they have done a good job                             |
| 54:24      | of making it relatively easy for apps developers.                 |
| 54:27      | If you look at the API calls                                      |
| 54:29      | and the way you set up a shortcut support,                        |
| 54:31      | it's not super difficult.                                         |
| 54:34      | I mean, I sat in in the session in [[WWDC]] with this                 |
| 54:38      | the last time I was able to go to [[WWDC]]                            |
| 54:40      | and it didn't seem to me like this was a mission impossible,      |
| 54:44      | but I feel like we're getting the developers                      |
| 54:49      | that are using shortcuts are usually coming in pretty shallow.    |
| 54:53      | They're not going in very deep with it.                           |
| 54:54      | Not everybody is [[BetterTouchTool]].                               |
| 54:57      | And I think that one of the reasons is                            |
| 54:59      | is Apple could do a better job making it easier                   |
| 55:01      | to integrate shortcuts with the core functions                    |
| 55:03      | of your application.                                              |
| 55:05      | Yes.                                                              |
| 55:06      | And I'd like to see them do that rather than Apple                |
| 55:08      | spend their time making a bunch of actions,                       |
| 55:10      | let the developers do it.                                         |
| 55:11      | Cause that's what we want them for.                               |
| 55:13      | And, you know.                                                    |
| 55:14      | Yes.                                                              |
| 55:15      | And so part of the simplification for me                          |
| 55:16      | in addition to making shortcuts more stable                       |
| 55:18      | would be to make it more accessible to developers.                |
| 55:22      | Yeah.                                                             |
| 55:23      | Yeah, that would definitely be greatly appreciated.               |
| 55:25      | I know Peter Lewis, the creator of Keybow My Sure                   |
| 55:28      | was asking some questions about shortcuts stuff                   |
| 55:31      | on Twitter the other day.                                         |
| 55:32      | And the fact that somebody who develops                           |
| 55:34      | one of the most powerful Mac apps ever,                           |
| 55:38      | you know, has to ask these questions                              |
| 55:40      | really means that, you know, there's something lacking there      |
| 55:45      | that just doesn't make it quite as easy as Apple think it is.     |
| 55:49      | And related to that, I really wish that they would do             |
| 55:51      | a better job of educating app review                              |
| 55:55      | on what the heck is shortcuts                                     |
| 55:56      | and why are shortcuts actions, you know, not a bad thing.         |
| 56:00      | Because for example, Nautomate was queried by App review           |
| 56:05      | of what do you think is the target audience for this?             |
| 56:07      | And [[Alex Hay\|Alex Hay's]] response was the same as the target audience      |
| 56:10      | for my other already popular app on the App Store, [[Toolbox Pro]].   |
| 56:13      | And it got through.                                               |
| 56:15      | But the fact that they asked that for something                   |
| 56:19      | that is related to an incredibly popular web app                  |
| 56:22      | with an automation platform that's just released,                 |
| 56:25      | you know, it is to me.                                            |
| 56:28      | And then it's being integrated into shortcuts.                    |
| 56:31      | It seems to me like maybe App review also needs                    |
| 56:35      | some help there and, you know, some more, you know,               |
| 56:40      | abilities to just find, for example, all of your shortcuts        |
| 56:44      | that are used using this particular app                           |
| 56:46      | or that particular app.                                           |
| 56:48      | Would that mean that I could share all of my,                     |
| 56:50      | for example, OmniFocus shortcuts with Omni Group                   |
| 56:53      | or I could share all of my draft shortcuts                        |
| 56:54      | with Agile Tortoise?                                              |
| 56:56      | And because I could do that,                                      |
| 56:57      | then they could actually, in turn,                                |
| 56:58      | create a shortcut showcase on their website of,                   |
| 57:01      | hey, here are some example shortcuts                              |
| 57:02      | some of our users are using,                                      |
| 57:04      | which promote shortcuts and promotes iOS and Apple.               |
| 57:08      | And then, you know, they can link back to that sort of thing.     |
| 57:11      | But I can't even search for shortcuts                             |
| 57:14      | which contain actions from a specific app right now,              |
| 57:17      | which also makes it difficult for developers.                     |
| 57:19      | Wait, which was the shortcut that had my app's action in it?      |
| 57:23      | Well, they have to go through and open them and find out.         |
| 57:26      | It's not great.                                                   |
| 57:27      | Yeah, but, you know, that's always been a challenge at Apple      |
| 57:29      | to get kind of company-wide buy-in to automation.                 |
| 57:33      | I mean, I remember...                                             |
| 57:34      | Well, it's not so much automation that I'm concerned about.       |
| 57:36      | It's just the fact that there are, you know,                      |
| 57:38      | core features on their platform                                   |
| 57:40      | that they seem to not think is a sales-worthy feature.            |
| 57:45      | Like, that is what really struck me about that.                   |
| 57:49      | Well, I mean, just to finish the thought,                         |
| 57:51      | when Automator came out,                                          |
| 57:54      | Microsoft had way better support for Word and Excel.              |
| 57:58      | I mean, they hired a guy to write them for them,                  |
| 58:01      | but they had Automator actions                                    |
| 58:04      | that were way better than what they had for pages.                |
| 58:07      | You know, I mean, it just...                                      |
| 58:08      | And it's just Apple,                                              |
| 58:10      | just because Apple as a platform developer                        |
| 58:12      | has this shortcut thing,                                          |
| 58:14      | it doesn't seem like everybody in app review                      |
| 58:17      | gets behind it and understands how important this is.             |
| 58:21      | So [[Alex Hay]] has to deal with that kind of nonsense.               |
| 58:24      | And I think that's always been an issue.                          |
| 58:25      | And I guess that's another thing I would like                     |
| 58:27      | is I'd like to see them continue.                                 |
| 58:30      | First, let me just qualify everything I'm gonna say now           |
| 58:33      | because to me, stabilisation of shortcuts                         |
| 58:36      | is mission critical at this point.                                |
| 58:38      | I mean, it has to happen.                                         |
| 58:40      | And if nothing else happens,                                      |
| 58:41      | I will go on record here that I will not complain.                |
| 58:45      | If you say, look, we didn't really add anything,                  |
| 58:47      | but everything works way better, I will be happy.                 |
| 58:51      | Because I think the app developers                                |
| 58:52      | will be adding things for us.                                     |
| 58:54      | We're getting a [[BetterTouchTool]]                                 |
| 58:56      | is the Trojan horse of shortcuts, right?                          |
| 58:58      | And there'll be more of those                                     |
| 58:59      | if they make the platform more stable.                            |
| 59:01      | So, but that being said,                                          |
| 59:03      | let's say they fix everything, they make it more stable           |
| 59:06      | and they have some time.                                          |
| 59:07      | I'd like to see them on the Mac,                                  |
| 59:08      | make more of a dent in those Automator actions                    |
| 59:11      | that haven't made it over yet.                                    |
| 59:13      | I'd like to see them kind of finish that up.                      |
| 59:15      | Yes, yeah, same. And I really would love,                         |
| 59:19      | you know, for all of the Mac apps,                                |
| 59:23      | especially those that don't update in sync with Mac OS            |
| 59:27      | to have better shortcut support.                                  |
| 59:30      | And so a great example of a team that's done it right,            |
| 59:34      | iWork team, they just released a bunch of actions                 |
| 59:36      | for iWork on the Mac,                                             |
| 59:38      | which allows you to do things like create pages documents         |
| 59:41      | and open pages documents                                          |
| 59:42      | and open a presentation in presenter mode                         |
| 59:45      | or rehearsal mode and things like that.                           |
| 59:48      | That is great.                                                    |
| 59:49      | I am really glad that they're adding things like that.            |
| 59:51      | And I really hope, you know,                                      |
| 59:53      | the [[Safari]] team pops along and goes,                              |
| 59:55      | oh, hang on a minute, we could do this.                           |
| 59:58      | Let's, let's put some stuff in [[Safari Technology Preview]],         |
| 01:00:01   | give people some earlier access to things.                        |
| 01:00:04   | And then bam, we get some new actions next time                   |
| 01:00:07   | [[Safari]] updates as part of Mac OS or independently.                |
| 01:00:11   | And [[Xcode]], you know, [[Xcode]] could add some actions.                |
| 01:00:14   | So be nice, you know, it would be a really great                  |
| 01:00:18   | to see buy-in from internal Apple software developers             |
| 01:00:22   | as well as all of the other app developers out there              |
| 01:00:26   | doing all of those things.                                        |
| 01:00:28   | I remember reading in Machiavelli,                                |
| 01:00:29   | talked about generations like of revolution.                      |
| 01:00:33   | You know, this is totally kind of unrelated,                      |
| 01:00:35   | but there'd be a revolutionary generation                         |
| 01:00:37   | that turns everything upside down                                 |
| 01:00:39   | than the next generation would be the one that consolidates.      |
| 01:00:42   | I feel like shortcuts has been in the revolution now              |
| 01:00:45   | for like three years and we got to get out of the revolution.     |
| 01:00:48   | We got to kind of get into the consolidation phase                |
| 01:00:50   | of all of this, but either way, it's not that far off.            |
| 01:00:56   | And I'm sure Rose and I will have opinions.                       |
| 01:00:59   | Oh, we always have opinions, but I should say, you know,          |
| 01:01:03   | I'm really glad that shortcuts is on the Mac.                     |
| 01:01:05   | Is it perfect?                                                    |
| 01:01:05   | No, but nothing is perfect.                                       |
| 01:01:08   | And it can only get better by existing.                           |
| 01:01:11   | And the team that have put all of their hard work into this,      |
| 01:01:14   | you know, they should know that they've done a great thing.       |
| 01:01:17   | And the reason why we're complaining is                           |
| 01:01:18   | because we're using it and we're loving it                        |
| 01:01:20   | and we want to do it more.                                        |
| 01:01:22   | And that's, you know, that's, you know,                           |
| 01:01:25   | at its core why we have, you know, why we're saying,              |
| 01:01:30   | you know, things because, you know,                               |
| 01:01:31   | it is great that we're using all of this stuff                    |
| 01:01:34   | and we want personally to be able to do more                      |
| 01:01:37   | and also for everybody else to be able to do more.                |
| 01:01:40   | And that is, you know, what we're going to see.                   |
| 01:01:44   | And I'm also hoping that maybe we're going to see                 |
| 01:01:47   | a little update on the future of Automator.                       |
| 01:01:49   | Because I mean, they've already said Automator                    |
| 01:01:52   | is not long for this world.                                       |
| 01:01:53   | Auto, the Automator will be going into retirement                 |
| 01:01:56   | at some point because Automator actions                           |
| 01:01:58   | can be converted into shortcuts.                                  |
| 01:02:00   | And, you know, that is then the end of Automator.                 |
| 01:02:05   | So I'm wondering if we're going to see Automator                  |
| 01:02:08   | be removed this year at [[WWDC]]                                      |
| 01:02:11   | or if it will hang around for another year                        |
| 01:02:14   | or maybe to a 0.1 or 0.3 release of Mac OS,                       |
| 01:02:17   | I guess we'll have to wait and see.                               |
| 01:02:19   | Yeah. And I guess I should be clear on that too.                  |
| 01:02:23   | The shortcut scene has done remarkable work                       |
| 01:02:26   | getting it over, not only did they get it on the Mac,             |
| 01:02:28   | they did it with [[SwiftUI]],                                        |
| 01:02:30   | which is not an entirely baked system yet, you know.              |
| 01:02:33   | So they really had a hand tied behind their back,                 |
| 01:02:35   | in my opinion, I'm sure they won't say that,                      |
| 01:02:38   | but that's the way I feel.                                        |
| 01:02:40   | I think they used more than just [[SwiftUI]]                         |
| 01:02:42   | because [[SwiftUI]] for the Mac really is very tricky.               |
| 01:02:45   | And I have to say, it does work like a Mac application.           |
| 01:02:49   | You know, there are some bits where I'm like,                     |
| 01:02:50   | oh, this is very iOS-y.                                           |
| 01:02:53   | But, you know, overall, you know,                                 |
| 01:02:55   | they have done a great job there.                                 |
| 01:02:56   | Yeah. And I have complaints, but at the same time,                |
| 01:02:59   | I use shortcuts on the Mac every day.                             |
| 01:03:02   | I mean, every day, I rely on it at this point.                    |
| 01:03:05   | So I really am a fan.                                             |
| 01:03:08   | And I actually think we're just at the rough spot right now.      |
| 01:03:13   | And actually, we may be past the worst of it                      |
| 01:03:15   | because just in the last couple of months,                        |
| 01:03:17   | shortcuts has made a ton of improvements.                         |
| 01:03:20   | And I feel like they are in the process                           |
| 01:03:22   | of like tightening down the bolts.                                |
| 01:03:24   | And once that job is done,                                        |
| 01:03:26   | then they can start expanding it and making it better.            |
| 01:03:29   | And I feel like this is just like growing pains                   |
| 01:03:31   | more than anything else.                                          |
| 01:03:32   | But I would like to see more progress on that.                    |
| 01:03:35   | The share at [[WWDC]].                                                |
| 01:03:37   | Yeah. And I'm sure we will.                                       |

| 01:05:20   | Rose, in the last segment,                                        |
| 01:05:21   | you just casually stated you were working                         |
| 01:05:24   | on your new Mac Studio.                                           |
| 01:05:26   | Uh-huh, yep.                                                      |
| 01:05:27   | You didn't tell me.                                               |
| 01:05:28   | So you got your Mac Studio.                                       |
| 01:05:29   | Congratulations. I did.                                           |
| 01:05:31   | I did.                                                            |
| 01:05:31   | The Mac Studio display is, well,                                  |
| 01:05:34   | existence is theoretical.                                         |
| 01:05:36   | Apple have told me it should be with me sometime                  |
| 01:05:38   | between the 20th of May and something of June.                    |
| 01:05:42   | So, you know, I'm sure that it exists in theory.                  |
| 01:05:45   | Maybe the box already exists,                                     |
| 01:05:47   | but I'm sure it's in the process of manufacturing                 |
| 01:05:49   | rather than actually existing                                     |
| 01:05:51   | and having a serial number and all that jazz.                     |
| 01:05:53   | But the Mac Studio itself is sitting right here on my desk        |
| 01:05:56   | and, you know, getting on with everything,                        |
| 01:05:59   | just doing the work because it's great.                           |
| 01:06:03   | I love it. It's really powerful.                                  |
| 01:06:05   | It no longer, unlike my M1 iMac,                                  |
| 01:06:08   | which I still love and I am currently in the process              |
| 01:06:11   | of deciding what precisely to do with it.                         |
| 01:06:13   | It does not complain                                              |
| 01:06:15   | when I'm running multiple node applications                       |
| 01:06:18   | and [[Xcode]] simulators at the same time,                            |
| 01:06:20   | which was kind of my problem before.                              |
| 01:06:22   | I should know that, you know, developer work,                     |
| 01:06:25   | I should have expected as much of an M1,                          |
| 01:06:28   | but the 32 gigabytes of RAM and the M1 Pro                        |
| 01:06:32   | are serving me well.                                              |
| 01:06:34   | I am really impressed.                                            |
| 01:06:35   | This machine is lightning fast and it works.                      |
| 01:06:39   | It's great.                                                       |
| 01:06:41   | And, you know, I've,                                              |
| 01:06:43   | I actually use migration assistant this time.                     |
| 01:06:45   | I don't usually use migration assistant.                          |
| 01:06:47   | I usually take the opportunity to nuke everything                 |
| 01:06:49   | and set it up again,                                              |
| 01:06:50   | but I've not had the iMac for very long.                          |
| 01:06:52   | So I decided that I just transfer everything over                 |
| 01:06:55   | and it worked really well.                                        |
| 01:06:56   | I'm really pleased.                                               |
| 01:06:57   | So you were going from,                                           |
| 01:06:59   | so you got the M1 Macs chip, not the M1 Pro chip, right?          |
| 01:07:04   | Whichever the lower end one is, I'm now.                          |
| 01:07:06   | Yeah, the Macs.                                                   |
| 01:07:07   | The Macs.                                                         |
| 01:07:08   | Is the Macs the lower?                                            |
| 01:07:09   | I thought the Macs was the high.                                  |
| 01:07:10   | The Macs is the high on the laptop,                               |
| 01:07:12   | but it's low on the Mac Studio.                                   |
| 01:07:14   | The Ultra is the high on the Mac Studio.                          |
| 01:07:16   | Right, yeah.                                                      |
| 01:07:17   | Oh, okay.                                                         |
| 01:07:18   | Then yes, that's what I got.                                      |
| 01:07:20   | I'm having a moment where I've forgotten                          |
| 01:07:21   | what's back my home Mac Studio is.                                |
| 01:07:23   | That's confusing, yeah.                                           |
| 01:07:25   | The big question a lot of people have is the fan noise            |
| 01:07:28   | that became kind of a discussion point                            |
| 01:07:30   | when they got released.                                           |
| 01:07:31   | How is it performing for you?                                     |
| 01:07:33   | Well, I have another really small computer sitting next           |
| 01:07:37   | to a running home assistant,                                      |
| 01:07:38   | which I need to migrate to the other side of my office,           |
| 01:07:39   | but I've been doing various things recently.                      |
| 01:07:41   | So in comparison to that,                                         |
| 01:07:43   | I have no idea if there is fan noise                              |
| 01:07:45   | because that thing that has a fan in it,                          |
| 01:07:47   | it's not very loud to be clear,                                   |
| 01:07:48   | but that fan is just always running.                              |
| 01:07:50   | So I certainly don't hear the M1, the Mac Studio at all.          |
| 01:07:56   | You know, it's not a problem.                                     |
| 01:07:58   | I think probably when I am running multiple node apps             |
| 01:08:01   | and everything,                                                   |
| 01:08:02   | it will be spinning up the fans a little bit,                     |
| 01:08:04   | but I've not noticed it yet.                                      |
| 01:08:06   | So I'm pretty happy with that.                                    |
| 01:08:08   | Also, I have like the biggest size of IKEA Bekant desk            |
| 01:08:12   | and this Mac Studio is right over in the corner on the back.      |
| 01:08:16   | So even when the fan's spin up,                                   |
| 01:08:18   | it's not going to reach my microphone.                            |
| 01:08:19   | And I've usually got music playing                                |
| 01:08:21   | if I'm not podcasting or similar.                                 |
| 01:08:22   | So that should be good.                                           |
| 01:08:24   | I don't think I'm going to have a problem with that.              |
| 01:08:26   | Yeah.                                                             |
| 01:08:27   | You know, I had a meet up with the,                                |
| 01:08:28   | a virtual meet up with the Mac Sparky Labs members.               |
| 01:08:30   | And there were like four or five people in there                  |
| 01:08:32   | that had the new Mac Studio                                       |
| 01:08:34   | and none of them said that the noise was overwhelming.            |
| 01:08:37   | I think that's a bit of a red herring.                            |
| 01:08:39   | It definitely, I guess does make some noise,                      |
| 01:08:41   | but for people to record.                                         |
| 01:08:43   | It's got a fan in it,                                             |
| 01:08:45   | but I think it's just like the M1 new MacBook Pros.               |
| 01:08:50   | Like it's got a fan, but it's rarely going to spin up.            |
| 01:08:53   | I mean, even when it does, it's really quiet.                     |
| 01:08:56   | If you compare it to say like a desktop gaming machine            |
| 01:08:59   | with all of those fans in,                                        |
| 01:09:00   | it's nowhere near as loud as that.                                |
| 01:09:02   | You're going to be fine.                                          |
| 01:09:03   | It has fans that can fan,                                         |
| 01:09:06   | but also my M1 iMac has fans in it that could, you know, spin.    |
| 01:09:10   | And if I put my fingers underneath the display                    |
| 01:09:13   | and if it was still on,                                           |
| 01:09:14   | then I might even feel some of the air coming out,                |
| 01:09:16   | but it's, you know,                                               |
| 01:09:19   | I very much doubt that fan noise is going to be a problem.        |
| 01:09:22   | And quite frankly, you know,                                      |
| 01:09:23   | computers do make noise a little bit.                             |
| 01:09:25   | It's just a fact of life, but I'm okay with that.                 |
| 01:09:28   | How has it affected like your build times and that stuff?         |
| 01:09:32   | What build times?                                                 |
| 01:09:34   | That's how much has affected them.                                |
| 01:09:35   | Yeah, like things didn't take long before,                        |
| 01:09:38   | but now I like, you know, I go to switch away to,                 |
| 01:09:42   | I don't know, like, you know, open, you know,                     |
| 01:09:45   | a link that my mom sent me from Twitter or something              |
| 01:09:47   | is like, nope, didn't need to do that.                            |
| 01:09:48   | I'm done, which is great.                                         |
| 01:09:51   | I really appreciate that.                                         |
| 01:09:53   | So yeah, what build times is a very accurate answer               |
| 01:09:58   | to that question.                                                 |
| 01:09:59   | Sounds like two thumbs up.                                        |
| 01:10:01   | Oh yeah, definitely.                                              |
| 01:10:02   | This is a great machine.                                          |
| 01:10:03   | And I have to say, you know,                                      |
| 01:10:05   | especially if you already have a monitor                          |
| 01:10:07   | or you would like more of the studio monitors                     |
| 01:10:10   | or multiple of the studio monitors,                               |
| 01:10:11   | I really think it's good price wise as well                       |
| 01:10:13   | because it is an M1 Max chip in there, you know,                  |
| 01:10:17   | in the base model.                                                |
| 01:10:19   | And that is quite frankly, insanely powerful.                     |
| 01:10:23   | You could go up to the Ultra,                                     |
| 01:10:25   | but it's good value for money either way.                         |
| 01:10:27   | The thing that it doesn't have,                                   |
| 01:10:28   | which the Mac Pro laptops do have is a battery.                   |
| 01:10:32   | And so if you do need to be able to take your machine places      |
| 01:10:35   | and, you know, just use it without, you know,                     |
| 01:10:38   | without anything else,                                            |
| 01:10:40   | then it's obviously not going to do that.                         |
| 01:10:41   | But if you're at home most of the time,                           |
| 01:10:44   | you're going to be just fine with the Mac Studio.                 |
| 01:10:46   | So did the purple keyboard come over                              |
| 01:10:49   | from the iMac to the, yeah?                                       |
| 01:10:51   | Well, I am using a Keychron,                                      |
| 01:10:54   | which I put custom keycaps on and custom switches.                |
| 01:10:56   | Thank you to the keyboard channel                                 |
| 01:10:59   | in the Relay FM subreddit for,                                    |
| 01:11:01   | or [[Discord]] sorry for enabling me there.                           |
| 01:11:03   | I went in and came out with a Keychron custom keycaps             |
| 01:11:06   | and custom switches.                                              |
| 01:11:09   | Yeah, yeah, I should warn people that place is dangerous,         |
| 01:11:12   | but lovely.                                                       |
| 01:11:13   | If you go in there with questions,                                |
| 01:11:14   | they are more than happy to help                                  |
| 01:11:16   | and they were very, very, very, you know,                         |
| 01:11:18   | happy to help me spend some money                                 |
| 01:11:20   | and get myself a really nice keyboard.                            |
| 01:11:22   | And so I've got a lovely RGB Keychron keyboard                    |
| 01:11:25   | with Boba U4 silent switches,                                     |
| 01:11:28   | which are not silent to be clear,                                 |
| 01:11:30   | but they are much quieter than other switches.                    |
| 01:11:33   | And I got some lovely purple to pink keycaps                      |
| 01:11:35   | because, you know, they're pretty.                                |
| 01:11:37   | So I will probably, yes.                                          |
| 01:11:39   | Yeah, I will probably not end up keeping                          |
| 01:11:41   | the magic keyboard and trackpad                                   |
| 01:11:44   | that came with the M1 iMac,                                       |
| 01:11:45   | just because if I am selling                                      |
| 01:11:47   | or giving the M1 iMac to somebody,                                |
| 01:11:50   | they're going to want the keyboard                                |
| 01:11:51   | and mouse with it as well.                                        |
| 01:11:53   | So that will go with it.                                          |
| 01:11:54   | But I may end up with another magic keyboard                      |
| 01:11:58   | with the Touch ID on because Touch ID is useful.                  |
| 01:12:01   | But honestly, with the Unlock with Apple Watch feature            |
| 01:12:03   | that I've got on, that you can just enable on your Mac,           |
| 01:12:08   | I don't need Touch ID most of the time.                           |
| 01:12:12   | I can just double press the side of my watch                      |
| 01:12:14   | and I'm unlocked.                                                 |
| 01:12:16   | Would you use for a mouse just real quick?                        |
| 01:12:18   | I know we're kind of off target for automators,                   |
| 01:12:20   | but I was just curious.                                           |
| 01:12:22   | I'm using a Razer Basilisk at the moment,                         |
| 01:12:24   | which I really like because it's wireless.                        |
| 01:12:28   | It's RGB, which is very nice.                                     |
| 01:12:30   | It's wireless in the sense that it's got a dongle                 |
| 01:12:33   | that you plug in, but I bought the one with the charging dock.    |
| 01:12:37   | So the dongle plugs into the charging dock                        |
| 01:12:39   | and then when I'm not using the mouse,                            |
| 01:12:40   | like I would go to walk away,                                     |
| 01:12:42   | I just put the mouse on the charging dock and it charges,         |
| 01:12:45   | which is amazing.                                                 |
| 01:12:46   | And I love it because that was a problem                          |
| 01:12:49   | that I have with the Logitech,                                    |
| 01:12:50   | that I would forget to charge it                                  |
| 01:12:51   | and then I'd have to use it cabled.                               |
| 01:12:53   | Whereas now I can just put my mouse on the dock                   |
| 01:12:55   | and walk away at the end of the day and it's charged.             |
| 01:12:58   | I pick it up in the morning, it's fully charged.                  |
| 01:12:59   | I never need to think about it.                                   |
| 01:13:01   | Put a name for a mouse, man.                                      |
| 01:13:03   | Oh yeah, I should also note that Razer,                           |
| 01:13:06   | like they make a lot of gaming things,                            |
| 01:13:08   | but they also have Snakey Snek, S-N-E-K.                         |
| 01:13:12   | And it is an adorable doodle of their mascot, the snake.          |
| 01:13:16   | But they turned it into like a cuddly plushy toy                  |
| 01:13:20   | and a hoodie and slippers and shoes and all sorts of things.      |
| 01:13:24   | And when people buy them, then it saves trees                     |
| 01:13:27   | because they are, you know, reinvesting that money                |
| 01:13:30   | in an eco-friendly manner.                                        |
| 01:13:31   | So I kind of got a mouse and a plushie at the same time,          |
| 01:13:35   | which is adorable.                                                |
| 01:13:37   | And sits on my desk looking at me                                 |
| 01:13:40   | or occasionally makes it into my lap                              |
| 01:13:41   | if I'm debugging something and it's getting very frustrating      |
| 01:13:44   | and I need something that I can squish                            |
| 01:13:46   | because Snakey is fortunately very malleable.                     |
| 01:13:48   | Maybe we should do a show sometime on automation                  |
| 01:13:50   | with our input devices, you know,                                 |
| 01:13:53   | like our track pads and mice.                                     |
| 01:13:55   | Okay, so what I'm hearing you say to me, David,                   |
| 01:13:58   | is that I need to go on the Razer website                         |
| 01:14:00   | and buy that mouse that's got like 16 buttons                     |
| 01:14:02   | on the thumb area because they've got one of those.               |
| 01:14:07   | I've forgotten which one it's called.                             |
| 01:14:08   | So I'm looking for it right now.                                  |
| 01:14:10   | Oh, there's the my section.                                       |
| 01:14:11   | I accidentally went to components,                                |
| 01:14:12   | which is almost what I wanted, but they have,                     |
| 01:14:17   | it's called the Naga.                                             |
| 01:14:19   | And I lied, it's only got 12 input buttons on the thumb side,     |
| 01:14:23   | but it comes in a left-handed and a right-handed mode.            |
| 01:14:26   | And so, yeah.                                                     |
| 01:14:28   | With that, the multiple [[Stream Deck\|Stream Decks]]                              |
| 01:14:30   | because the [[Stream Deck]] plus the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Pedal\|Stream Deck Pedal]], yeah.         |
| 01:14:34   | I definitely have a lot of input devices                          |
| 01:14:37   | running around on my desk.                                        |
| 01:14:38   | All right, let's talk about that at some point.                   |
| 01:14:41   | Cause I do too, I have a track pad and [[BetterTouchTool]].         |
| 01:14:44   | I think that's a feature topic,                                   |
| 01:14:46   | but I want to get, before we finish today,                        |
| 01:14:49   | I want to kind of get back to, you know, celebrating 100,         |
| 01:14:51   | but also thinking forward to episode 200.                         |
| 01:14:55   | You know, where would we like the show to be between now          |
| 01:14:57   | and then and where do we see all this heading                     |
| 01:14:59   | and I guess let's start with where is all this heading?           |
| 01:15:03   | I feel like automation, this democratisation,                     |
| 01:15:07   | I was talking about earlier,                                      |
| 01:15:08   | I think that is going to improve                                  |
| 01:15:11   | in the next 100 episodes of the Automated Podcast.                |
| 01:15:14   | I feel like over the next couple of years, you know,              |
| 01:15:17   | shortcuts is getting past its growing pains                       |
| 01:15:20   | and third-party developers on the Mac,                            |
| 01:15:23   | but also on iOS are going to increasingly adopt it.               |
| 01:15:25   | I think that we're going to have a lot more power                 |
| 01:15:29   | and stability in shortcuts in 100 episodes than we have now.      |
| 01:15:33   | Yes. And I also think we're going to see                          |
| 01:15:34   | a lot more developers go ahead and create                         |
| 01:15:38   | small utility apps that just do things really well.               |
| 01:15:42   | So for example, you know, we've got, you know,                    |
| 01:15:45   | push cut, which exists to run shortcuts                           |
| 01:15:48   | on your iPhone automatically.                                     |
| 01:15:50   | It's running on a dedicated device.                               |
| 01:15:52   | You know, we're going to see more things like that.               |
| 01:15:53   | And, you know, hopefully, you know,                               |
| 01:15:55   | we'll see more people branching out into using things             |
| 01:15:59   | like [[Keyboard Maestro]],                                            |
| 01:16:00   | which is always gaining more actions.                             |
| 01:16:03   | Genuinely, I have no idea how it does.                            |
| 01:16:04   | I blink and it feels like there's 13 new actions,                 |
| 01:16:07   | which is not quite true,                                          |
| 01:16:08   | but every action can be used in so many ways                      |
| 01:16:10   | that it certainly feels like it.                                  |
| 01:16:12   | So I really feel like we are just going to see an increase,       |
| 01:16:15   | both in the number of people who want to use automation           |
| 01:16:18   | and who go and try to automate something,                         |
| 01:16:22   | and then also, you know,                                          |
| 01:16:23   | the number of automation options for those people,                |
| 01:16:26   | because people are seeing,                                        |
| 01:16:27   | I know how I can create a way to solve this for this person,      |
| 01:16:30   | and that's going to make that easier for them.                    |
| 01:16:32   | And so they do it, and that is great.                             |
| 01:16:34   | Another trend I see that I think is going to increase,            |
| 01:16:37   | it only increase,                                                 |
| 01:16:38   | is literally kind of two things combined.                         |
| 01:16:41   | Number one is I think multi-platform                              |
| 01:16:43   | is going to become a bigger deal                                  |
| 01:16:44   | that you write an automation                                      |
| 01:16:46   | and it works on your Mac and your iPhone,                         |
| 01:16:48   | but maybe it works on the web too.                                |
| 01:16:50   | And, you know, I don't know,                                      |
| 01:16:51   | but I just feel like a multi-platform                             |
| 01:16:53   | is going to become more important.                                |
| 01:16:55   | And at the same time,                                             |
| 01:16:57   | I think [[JavaScript]] is going to become more essential              |
| 01:17:01   | for automation.                                                   |
| 01:17:02   | I think a lot of people are leaning into JavaScript.              |
| 01:17:04   | I mean, they just released [[Audio Hijack\|Audio Hijack 4]],                        |
| 01:17:08   | which has shortcuts integration,                                  |
| 01:17:09   | but it also has [[JavaScript]] automation.                            |
| 01:17:12   | And JavaScript is where you can really                            |
| 01:17:14   | make that application dance.                                      |
| 01:17:16   | I think if you want to automate,                                  |
| 01:17:18   | starting to get a little familiar with [[JavaScript]]                 |
| 01:17:21   | is a good idea.                                                   |
| 01:17:23   | Yes, yeah, it really is.                                          |
| 01:17:25   | And we've seen more and more applications                         |
| 01:17:27   | add support for scripting using [[JavaScript]].                       |
| 01:17:29   | So, you know, [[Audio Hijack]] is a recent one,                       |
| 01:17:32   | but [[Drafts]] has been automating with [[JavaScript]]                    |
| 01:17:35   | for a very long time.                                             |
| 01:17:37   | And, you know, Omni Group added support                           |
| 01:17:39   | to all of their applications,                                     |
| 01:17:40   | which it just feels like it's a language                          |
| 01:17:44   | that more and more people will be able to learn                   |
| 01:17:47   | and use in so many ways.                                          |
| 01:17:50   | And that doesn't mean that there is no place                      |
| 01:17:51   | for things like Perl or Python and so on.                         |
| 01:17:54   | Those are still great tools,                                      |
| 01:17:55   | and especially if you're looking to just automate,                |
| 01:17:58   | you know, random things,                                          |
| 01:18:00   | automate the boring stuff with Python                             |
| 01:18:01   | is a book and a Udemy course,                                     |
| 01:18:04   | and it works and the languages                                    |
| 01:18:06   | is great for solving many problems.                               |
| 01:18:08   | But I think, you know,                                            |
| 01:18:09   | if people are looking to just upgrade                             |
| 01:18:12   | their automation knowledge,                                       |
| 01:18:14   | then we've got JavaScript there ready.                            |
| 01:18:16   | You know, it's not waiting in the wings.                          |
| 01:18:18   | It's just, you know, it's in the starting blocks                  |
| 01:18:20   | for a lot of people,                                              |
| 01:18:22   | but for some of us, it's already part of the way                  |
| 01:18:23   | around the racetrack.                                             |
| 01:18:24   | We just don't know how long the race is gonna be.                 |
| 01:18:25   | Yeah, and for the show,                                           |
| 01:18:27   | I guess I actually forget to show another thing is,               |
| 01:18:30   | and we said this earlier, though,                                 |
| 01:18:31   | I think the web-based automation stuff                            |
| 01:18:33   | is going to get a lot more powerful and better.                   |
| 01:18:37   | The automate, the web stuff right now                             |
| 01:18:39   | still feels kind of cryptic to me.                                |
| 01:18:42   | It's not that easy to do it                                       |
| 01:18:44   | in comparison to something like shortcuts.                        |
| 01:18:46   | And I feel like the big winner in the battle                      |
| 01:18:49   | to get our web automation dollars                                 |
| 01:18:51   | is gonna be the people who figure out                             |
| 01:18:53   | how to make it easier or faster.                                  |
| 01:18:55   | Yeah, I do think that is the case.                                |
| 01:18:57   | And I think that, you know,                                       |
| 01:18:58   | we've got very lucky having the tools                             |
| 01:19:01   | that we've got already.                                           |
| 01:19:02   | So for example, in particular,                                    |
| 01:19:04   | [[Zapier]] and [[Make]], I find much easier to use                        |
| 01:19:07   | than I originally found, if this than that.                       |
| 01:19:10   | And also, you know, they have support                             |
| 01:19:12   | for things that if this than that didn't have                     |
| 01:19:16   | or and still doesn't have in some cases,                          |
| 01:19:18   | but also particularly, you know,                                  |
| 01:19:19   | the fact that it's a very, you know,                              |
| 01:19:23   | you see a list of your actions                                    |
| 01:19:25   | and then you open, you know, one of the actions                   |
| 01:19:27   | and you see all of the different parts of it                      |
| 01:19:29   | really does help.                                                 |
| 01:19:31   | And especially in [[Make]] where it's so visual of,                   |
| 01:19:35   | you know, you've got this dot                                     |
| 01:19:36   | and this dot has got a line going to that dot                     |
| 01:19:38   | and you click on the dot                                          |
| 01:19:39   | and it shows you exactly what is going on there.                  |
| 01:19:42   | That's really great.                                              |
| 01:19:43   | And I think we're going to see more and more of that sort         |
| 01:19:46   | of thing coming along and also more integration with those.       |
| 01:19:50   | So, you know, app developers are not just adding,                 |
| 01:19:54   | you know, shortcuts actions,                                      |
| 01:19:55   | but they're also adding integrations                              |
| 01:19:57   | so that other people can create and run things.                   |
| 01:20:01   | You know, I could create an [[Audio Hijack]]                                |
| 01:20:02   | script and share it with you.                              |
| 01:20:04   | And that is great.                                                |
| 01:20:06   | And web services that add APIs will end up                        |
| 01:20:09   | with things like [[Make}]] and [[Zapier]] integrations,                    |
| 01:20:12   | but they'll also have people just create tools                    |
| 01:20:15   | that do something using their application.                        |
| 01:20:17   | And more and more people use our application                      |
| 01:20:19   | because that tool exists,                                         |
| 01:20:20   | which solves this problem for them.                               |
| 01:20:22   | Yeah, totally agreed.                                             |
| 01:20:24   | For the show, I mean, we've never really made a mystery           |
| 01:20:26   | of our goal with the show.                                        |
| 01:20:27   | We want anybody to be able to climb                               |
| 01:20:30   | on the automation tree.                                           |
| 01:20:31   | We want people listening who've never written an automation       |
| 01:20:34   | to learn enough here to start writing automations,                |
| 01:20:37   | but that's not the only thing.                                    |
| 01:20:38   | You know, we want you to get on the train.                        |
| 01:20:40   | We want to start you moving up towards the engine                 |
| 01:20:42   | and so the goal with every episode                                |
| 01:20:45   | is to give something to people who haven't automated              |
| 01:20:48   | an avenue or an on-ramp.                                          |
| 01:20:50   | And then people who are already automating,                       |
| 01:20:52   | we want to help you get better at it.                             |
| 01:20:53   | And that hasn't changed.                                          |
| 01:20:55   | We're going to be aiming for the same thing at episode 200.       |
| 01:20:58   | You know, we're just going to keep doing it.                      |
| 01:21:00   | We're going to keep getting great guests                          |
| 01:21:01   | and keep talking about different angles of this                   |
| 01:21:04   | to find some way to help you get better at this stuff.            |
| 01:21:07   | Exactly.                                                          |
| 01:21:08   | And honestly, you know, I have a goal of get more guests          |
| 01:21:12   | on that teaches things that we didn't know                        |
| 01:21:14   | or give us ideas that we didn't have                              |
| 01:21:17   | because we learned stuff from every single guest.                 |
| 01:21:20   | And so many of the things that we come up with                    |
| 01:21:21   | in later episodes are because that guest was on                   |
| 01:21:23   | and they talked about this thing.                                 |
| 01:21:25   | And even if we haven't put the puzzle pieces together             |
| 01:21:27   | and made that link ourselves,                                     |
| 01:21:28   | that's how we end up coming up with so many ideas                 |
| 01:21:31   | because we have so many great guests                              |
| 01:21:33   | and also so many listeners who do, you know,                      |
| 01:21:35   | post enough forums and send us feedback,                          |
| 01:21:38   | just talking about things.                                        |
| 01:21:39   | I saw something in the Mac Power Users forum earlier today,       |
| 01:21:41   | somebody asking, so how can I activate a different scene          |
| 01:21:45   | when I come home in home care?                                    |
| 01:21:48   | And the answer is convert to a shortcut.                          |
| 01:21:51   | And so I told them that, but that's something                     |
| 01:21:53   | that I'm going to be thinking about a bit more                    |
| 01:21:55   | of, you know, doing different things when I come home.            |
| 01:21:58   | Well, maybe I should have, you know,                              |
| 01:22:01   | some if statements in there or a switch statement                 |
| 01:22:05   | using the choose action and home assistant.                       |
| 01:22:06   | You know, there's lots of ideas that get sparked                  |
| 01:22:09   | from just people automating.                                      |
| 01:22:11   | So I want more people to automate                                 |
| 01:22:13   | so I can have more ideas, please.                                 |
| 01:22:14   | I, you know, I forgot to say earlier,                             |
| 01:22:16   | you know, one of my favourite episodes of Automators               |
| 01:22:19   | is anytime you drop some crazy home automation on me,             |
| 01:22:23   | I get so much entertainment out of what Rose does                 |
| 01:22:26   | at her house with her automation.                                 |
| 01:22:28   | It's, I just love it, you know,                                   |
| 01:22:30   | the vibration sensor on the chair,                                |
| 01:22:32   | the motors on the blinds.                                         |
| 01:22:35   | I, Rose just never stopped doing that.                            |
| 01:22:37   | That's my only request.                                           |
| 01:22:39   | Fair enough, fair enough.                                         |
| 01:22:40   | I'm sure my accountant will be pleased to hear                    |
| 01:22:42   | that all of these are now legitimate business expenses.           |
| 01:22:44   | There we go.                                                      |
| 01:22:45   | But no, and no, you know,                                         |
| 01:22:47   | I do this stuff genuinely because I love it.                      |
| 01:22:49   | And also, you know, I'm curious how much of this stuff            |
| 01:22:52   | can I automate so that, you know,                                 |
| 01:22:54   | when I come into my office in the morning,                        |
| 01:22:56   | if I come in really early to do something,                        |
| 01:22:58   | I'm still in my pajamas.                                          |
| 01:22:59   | Yeah, the curtains and stuff are closed.                          |
| 01:23:01   | But then once I've got up, I don't have to come in and,           |
| 01:23:04   | oh right, well, before I start work,                              |
| 01:23:05   | actually I need to, you know,                                     |
| 01:23:06   | pause and open the curtains and everything.                       |
| 01:23:08   | No, they opened because the curtains in my bedroom open,          |
| 01:23:11   | because the curtains in the living room open,                     |
| 01:23:13   | because the blind in the kitchen open,                            |
| 01:23:14   | because I told Siri that I'm up for the day.                      |
| 01:23:17   | And that, you know, didn't just open blinds and curtains          |
| 01:23:20   | in various rooms,                                                 |
| 01:23:21   | it also adjusted the heating appropriately                        |
| 01:23:24   | based on my schedule and things like that.                        |
| 01:23:26   | And, you know, all of those things are just me going,             |
| 01:23:29   | wait, what are the things I forget to do?                         |
| 01:23:32   | Or annoy me when I have to go do them.                            |
| 01:23:33   | So how can I automate them?                                       |
| 01:23:35   | And I think that is something that, you know,                     |
| 01:23:37   | people can just steal that idea.                                  |
| 01:23:40   | What's something that I forget to do?                             |
| 01:23:41   | What's something I hate doing?                                    |
| 01:23:43   | Right, can I automate it?                                         |
| 01:23:44   | Or can I automate part of it?                                     |
| 01:23:46   | Because that's what all of this is about.                         |
| 01:23:48   | Well, either way, Episode 200 has come in                         |
| 01:23:50   | and I predict that both Rose and I will be here                   |
| 01:23:52   | talking about automation.                                         |
| 01:23:53   | We hope you will be here with us.                                 |

| 01:24:01   | we're going to go into the nitty gritty of how Rose               |
| 01:24:04   | got all those numbers out of the first episodes,                  |
| 01:24:06   | first hundred episodes with her scripts.                          |
