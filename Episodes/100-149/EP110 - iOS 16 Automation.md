| 00:00      | Hello and welcome to The Automators. I'm David Sparks and I'm joined by my co-host,                      |
| 00:05      | Rosemary Orchard. And this is where we talk about how to automate your technology to do                  |
| 00:10      | your work for you. Hello, Rose.                                                                          |
| 00:12      | Hey, David. How are you?                                                                                 |
| 00:14      | This is so exciting. This is the week that we're getting new iPhones and iOS 16 is releasing.            |
| 00:21      | And we wanted to spend some time today talking about all the fun automation tools you're                 |
| 00:27      | going to be getting when you install iOS 16. But before we dig into iOS 16, I want to take               |
| 00:32      | a minute to talk about St. Jude because it's September Gang and it's time for the annual                 |
| 00:36      | community support of St. Jude. Every year, Relay FM does an annual drive for St. Jude.                   |
| 00:43      | And we love collecting money and helping St. Jude. St. Jude is a children's research hospital            |
| 00:49      | finding cures and saving children. As you know, we have a personal relationship with                     |
| 00:53      | St. Jude at Relay. They took care of Steven's son when he was fighting cancer. But it runs               |
| 00:57      | so much deeper than that because anybody can give money to St. Jude and that money goes                  |
| 01:02      | to helping cure diseases in children. Now, this year, the goal is $494,000. But we really                |
| 01:09      | want to get there. We have a long way to go as I record this. We're only at $80,000.                     |
| 01:15      | But everyone at Relay is here pitching in, myself included. There's a lot of cool stuff                  |
| 01:20      | related to this. If you donate $60 or $100, you get limited time Relay FM rewards. If                    |
| 01:26      | you've got an employer that matches donations, this is the time to take advantage of that.               |
| 01:30      | Help out St. Jude. Make every $1 you donate, turn into $2 with employer matching. And best               |
| 01:36      | of all, there's going to be the Relay FM podcastathon on September 16th, which you can watch. There's    |
| 01:41      | a link at this website. So head over to stjude.org slash relay today. Join in on the fun of this.        |
| 01:48      | And this is fun and also do some real good and help out St. Jude. This is one of the                     |
| 01:53      | things I feel very privileged to take apart in every year. And I hope you do too. Once                   |
| 01:57      | again, that link is stjude.org slash relay. Help us all take on childhood cancer and help                |
| 02:04      | us all do some good. All right, now let's talk some nerdy stuff.                                         |
| 02:08      | Just as a clarifier for everybody, like we are recording this before the Apple announcement,             |
| 02:13      | but I know I am right in saying that there will be a gorgeous sort of plum, aubergine,                   |
| 02:18      | colour, metallic, purple iPhone pro. Like that that's happening. And so you've all heard                  |
| 02:25      | me now predict the future. You can send me the congratulatory messages. And if there                     |
| 02:29      | isn't one, then well, Tim Cook, I'm gonna have to send a letter. Like I need to send                     |
| 02:36      | the emails, I think I need that purple iPhone, David, we need proper purple.                             |
| 02:40      | Yeah, when I saw the rumors because it's been before the event, there are a lot of rumors                |
| 02:45      | that it's going to be purple. And I was taught about you immediately. I'm like, oh, it's                 |
| 02:50      | the Rosemary Orchard year. Yeah, I mean, we've had green, we've                                          |
| 02:53      | had blue. And I feel like if you're transitioning around the colour wheel, purple is the obvious          |
| 02:58      | next choice, right? Because, you know, between yellow and blue, you've got the green. So                 |
| 03:04      | it's primary colours. And so therefore the other primary colour to transition to will                      |
| 03:08      | be red. And you have to go via purple. Like we can just stop at purple as far as I'm                     |
| 03:12      | concerned and just live there forever. But you know, hopefully we'll get a purple one                    |
| 03:15      | this year. I know that's your colour. That's your colour.                                                  |
| 03:17      | It's definitely my colour. As somebody at work saw something the other day that was really                |
| 03:22      | purple. I don't even remember what it was. It was very, I think it was just like a strange               |
| 03:25      | looking kitchen utensil. And they just put a photo in it and said, I immediately in our                  |
| 03:30      | group chat and immediately said, I immediately thought of Rose. So, you know, I clearly my               |
| 03:35      | purple love is well known, but I think that's a good thing.                                              |
| 03:39      | So going in and now we're recording this a few days before the event. But so we really                   |
| 03:42      | don't know anything. But do you have any idea which phone you kind of think you want going               |
| 03:48      | in?                                                                                                      |
| 03:49      | Yeah. So I mean, I love the idea of the Pro Max. And I've had the Pro Max before. It's                   |
| 03:56      | a great device. It's too big. It just gets to the point where it's unwieldy to hold for                  |
| 04:03      | me and uncomfortable. And I have an iPad mini. Now, my mom has been sort of attempting to                |
| 04:10      | eye up my iPad mini and making subtle, you know, hints of, you know, that device size                    |
| 04:15      | looks really small. Oh, that looks like I could always just have that in my handbag.                     |
| 04:20      | But I think if she gets an iPad mini, she's getting her own because it's purple. So how                  |
| 04:26      | could I let that go, right? But yeah, I think I think I'm sticking with the just Pro No                  |
| 04:31      | Max unless they do something amazing with the camera. Seems unlikely though. What about                  |
| 04:35      | you?                                                                                                     |
| 04:36      | That's sometimes like they do have like the better cameras sometimes in the Max size.                    |
| 04:41      | So the last year I was on the standard size iPhone Pro and it was fine. And I've had the                 |
| 04:46      | Max's in the past and those were fine too. I do kind of like maybe it's, you know, the                   |
| 04:52      | thing about as you get older, your eyes get worse. I do kind of like the the bigger phone.               |
| 04:57      | It's easier to read. And I don't know though, I think I'm leaning this year towards going                |
| 05:03      | to the Max size, but even hasn't happened yet. I haven't, I haven't entered the reality                  |
| 05:08      | distortion field. So who knows how it's all going to play out.                                           |
| 05:11      | Yeah, I think that's the thing, right? Until we actually know what's on offer in them,                   |
| 05:15      | like when the 10 s came out, I was mad. Like I don't need that. There's no reason for me                 |
| 05:20      | to get a 10 s. I have the 10. It's great. And then I realised that they were physical                    |
| 05:25      | dual SIM iPhones available from Hong Kong running standard iOS, because the other ones                   |
| 05:30      | from from China are running the modified for China iOS version. But the Hong Kong ones                   |
| 05:36      | are running standard. And so, you know, I ended up buying a Hong Kong iPhone 10 s because                |
| 05:42      | it had the NFC scanning as well. Without having to open another app first, you know, the 10              |
| 05:48      | had an NFC tag reader in it, but it didn't just let you read an NFC tag by just sort                     |
| 05:53      | of, you know, placing your phone towards it. So yeah, that's how that happened. And I                    |
| 05:59      | was sure I would be fine. And this year, I feel like I'm fine, but I also think I'm                      |
| 06:02      | going to end up upgrading for some reason. Like Apple always comes out with something                    |
| 06:06      | plus, you know, it's kind of part of my job to have the latest and greatest shiny thing.                 |
| 06:10      | So, you know, hopefully it'll be a purple one. Yeah, I always get a new one every year.                  |
| 06:14      | I can't help myself. We do, we do recycle them down through the family and one comes                     |
| 06:19      | out the bottom and I sell it back. But I don't know what I'll be getting, but I'm leaning                |
| 06:25      | towards Max. But I don't know, like I said, it's always kind of fun, though, to speculate.               |
| 06:30      | But the good news is Apple is going to have answers out by the time this show publishes.                 |
| 06:34      | But you know what we don't have to speculate about is the new features coming to shortcuts.              |
| 06:39      | Both you and I installed the very first beta as soon as this thing shipped. And we have                  |
| 06:45      | been using them extensively. We both have made publications. I made a field guide, you                   |
| 06:51      | made a book about shortcuts. So we kind of make it our business to dig in on this stuff.                 |
| 06:56      | And this is the show, man, because if Apple falls, again, this is kind of a guess early,                 |
| 07:02      | but usually they release the, they have the announcement on Wednesday, my guess will be                  |
| 07:07      | that they'll probably release iOS 16 the following Wednesday and then the iPhone a couple days           |
| 07:12      | after that. Yeah, yeah, I'm kind of anticipating, you know, from a developer perspective that            |
| 07:18      | like iOS stuff is going to have to be ready to ship on the Friday, just because sometimes                |
| 07:24      | they do that. Like, you know, yeah, you can order the new iPhone from like next Friday                   |
| 07:29      | or next Wednesday and new iOS is available on Friday. And it's also just enough, it's                    |
| 07:35      | just long enough because they don't quite so aggressively push the official like first                   |
| 07:39      | release of things. The people will get the new iPhone and then have to upgrade their                     |
| 07:44      | old iPhone so that they can, you know, actually transfer everything across successfully because,         |
| 07:49      | you know, every so often like setting something up from a different iOS version, especially              |
| 07:53      | the new iPhones, which ship with usually a like a slight pre-release version, it doesn't                 |
| 08:00      | always go perfectly smoothly. So fingers crossed that will end up being okay. But there's no             |
| 08:05      | new iPad OS yet, David. iOS or iPad OS 16.0 is dead. It's not coming. They told us the                   |
| 08:12      | first one we're getting is 16.1. Yeah, which doesn't entirely surprise me.                               |
| 08:17      | No, they did a lot this year with [[Stage Manager]] and the iPhone is where Apple makes the most             |
| 08:25      | amount of money. I said this on [[Mac Power Users]] last week, but that's the one thing                      |
| 08:29      | that could get Tim Cook fired would be botching an iPhone launch. So, of course, they're going           |
| 08:34      | to spend a lot of time, you know, making sure the iPhone is right on target and everything's             |
| 08:39      | good when they launch that and whether it releases on Friday or the phone Wednesday,                     |
| 08:44      | the show will release on the Friday. So we're hoping that we get this in your inbox shortly              |
| 08:49      | before or right as the new operating system releases so you can go to your phone and start               |
| 08:54      | playing with the new toys as soon as possible. Yeah, yeah, hopefully we will, we'll have                 |
| 09:00      | to wait and see, but I'm crossing my fingers that it's going to all work out perfectly                   |
| 09:05      | and, you know, we'll just continue to be amazing as we always are, David.                                |
| 09:09      | Yeah, on today for the Automators max, we're going to go ahead and talk about iOS 17 because             |
| 09:15      | why not, right? Rosa and I still have wishes and ideas, so we thought that'd be fun for                  |
| 09:20      | the bonus episode today. But let's get it back to, you know, what people are getting                     |
| 09:25      | to know with iOS 16. We've got various categories to go through. What about, you want to talk            |
| 09:32      | about Sherlock first? Yeah, yeah, because iOS 16 Sherlock, some                                          |
| 09:37      | short cut sort of nations that I was doing, and I'm sure a bunch of other people are doing               |
| 09:40      | because I'm pretty certain that Apple doesn't have somebody just watching my anonymised                  |
| 09:45      | iPhone usage and going, right, okay, that's what she's doing. We're going to add that                    |
| 09:48      | feature for everyone. But they've killed, David, they've killed my need to use the set                   |
| 09:53      | Apple watch face action and the set background action because they've built it into focus                |
| 09:58      | modes, which I'm so excited about because this is very clearly in a case of Apple listening              |
| 10:06      | to user requests and what people are doing and going, well, why don't we just build that                 |
| 10:10      | in? Clearly people want this. Let's just put it everywhere for them.                                     |
| 10:13      | Yeah. So I want to talk about focus mode in detail because the changes this year are substantial,        |
| 10:21      | way more for a year or two than I ever expected. And it has changed the way I'm using focus              |
| 10:26      | modes. I was already a fan. Now I'm a bigger fan. And we're going to give that an entire                 |
| 10:30      | episode. So that will either be the next episode or the episode over after that, we're booking           |
| 10:34      | some guests right now. So it kind of depends. But if you're interested in focus mode, just               |
| 10:38      | stay, stay tuned. We got more content coming on that. But yeah, one of the pieces of it                  |
| 10:43      | is historically when you'd say a focus mode, if you wanted to customise the look of things,              |
| 10:48      | you had to run additional scripts. Now it's all tied into one. You can set the watch                     |
| 10:52      | face and the home screen and even the lock screen based on which focus mode you're in,                   |
| 10:59      | which is really cool. But let's put a pin in that one because there's a lot to talk                      |
| 11:05      | about there. Yeah, there is. And I think we're going to have to come back to this one later              |
| 11:09      | because there is just so much that you can do with a focus mode. But that's not all that                 |
| 11:18      | they've done because they've really integrated everything. But they've also just kind of                 |
| 11:23      | gone through and updated a bunch of things. And honestly, I'm really excited by the new                  |
| 11:28      | lock screen widgets, David, because I think that they are going to solve a lot of problems               |
| 11:33      | for people with regards to having easy access to contextual data at the right time, especially           |
| 11:40      | when combined with the fact that you can set your lock screen for your focus mode too.                   |
| 11:45      | So you've got your lock screen, your home screen, and your Apple watch face. So you                      |
| 11:50      | can have that data right there. And the today screen, like that widget view to the left                  |
| 11:56      | of the home screen, it's not gone yet. But I'm wondering if that's going to disappear                    |
| 11:59      | kind of soon now that we've got lock screen widgets.                                                     |
| 12:02      | I hope it doesn't, honestly, because I still find that really useful. I put a collection                 |
| 12:07      | of widgets over there that I may always want to see. They don't necessarily tie to an individual         |
| 12:12      | focus like the podcast app there, the weather app is there, like stuff I just want to get                |
| 12:18      | too quickly, but it doesn't matter what focus mode I'm in. And so I actually use that. I                 |
| 12:24      | use more widgets than fit on the screen. It scrolls down for me. So hopefully that stays                 |
| 12:29      | for me at least. But yeah, I agree with you in general that, you know, the whole thing                   |
| 12:33      | is becoming a much more customisable experience. Let's talk a little bit since we're talking             |
| 12:38      | about iOS 16. This isn't quite automation yet, but we're going to get there in a minute.                 |
| 12:42      | But the whole idea of these lock screen widgets, some of this stuff is beta, we probably can't           |
| 12:49      | talk about it all, but I can tell you that I've been included in some third party betas.                 |
| 12:54      | And I feel like the focus, I'm sorry, the lock screen widgets, actually, there's like                    |
| 12:59      | two levels of making this better. The first is getting apps other than Apple's apps in.                  |
| 13:04      | So, you know, your particular task manager or whatever it is that you want to get data                   |
| 13:09      | from, I think that's going to make it better. And I think the big move is going to be when               |
| 13:14      | they, they get that always on screen, which is highly rumored and it'll be shocking if                   |
| 13:19      | it's not true that the iPhone, the next version of iPhone pro will have a screen that doesn't            |
| 13:25      | turn off. So if you've got a widget on your screen and you set your phone down next to                   |
| 13:30      | your computer, you can look down at any time and see your next event or your time or whatever            |
| 13:35      | it is that you want to see.                                                                              |
| 13:36      | Yeah, I really hope if they do do that, that like, just like the Apple Watch has got a                   |
| 13:41      | nightstand mode that they implement the same kind of thing on your iPhone. Because I don't               |
| 13:48      | know about you and all the folks listening at home, but I have quite a few of those sort                 |
| 13:53      | of like upright chargers. I've got an Anker, a mega go magnetic charging stand. And I've                |
| 13:58      | got by my bed, Apple Frequently Partner with the Belkin. I've got the trio. So on the left,              |
| 14:05      | it's got the [[MagSafe]] pad on the right. It's got the Apple Watch pad on the base. You                     |
| 14:08      | can sort of drop your AirPods for charging. I have that by my bed. If my iPhone is stood                 |
| 14:14      | upright and it's glowing all night, that is going to really annoy me. But I'm sure Lola                  |
| 14:18      | thought about this and just like the Apple Watch, you know, while it's in sleep mode,                    |
| 14:23      | it will then, you know, not show your watch face or not show your iPhone home screen.                    |
| 14:31      | It'll just be, you know, black until you sort of tap it or something, which, you know, I                 |
| 14:36      | think would work quite well. Or maybe it'll be like the Samsung frame TV and use ambient                 |
| 14:41      | light where it can just turn off completely when it guesses it's dark enough. But we'll                  |
| 14:45      | have to see.                                                                                             |
| 14:46      | I have the [[MagSafe]] stand from Studio Neat. It's very nice. It's a piece of wall note.                    |
| 14:51      | It also charges the watch, which I think I'm going to keep next to my bed. I don't need                  |
| 14:56      | it vertical next to my bed, but I do like the idea of getting a vertical one on my desk                  |
| 15:01      | next to my Mac. And I don't own one. I'd like to get one that works with the [[MagSafe]]                     |
| 15:06      | puck. But beyond that, I don't know what I should get. Do you have any recommendations?                  |
| 15:12      | I mean, honestly, I really like my, my Anker one that I have. And I'm just looking to see               |
| 15:18      | exactly what the name is now. So I can put a link to it in the show notes for folks.                     |
| 15:22      | And of course, I'm not finding it on the Anker website because they started with a                      |
| 15:26      | few [[MagSafe]] accessories and then they kind of revamped how they were doing their, their,                 |
| 15:32      | their [[MagSafe]] or it's, it's not officially magnetic [[MagSafe]]. It's a magnetic wireless                    |
| 15:37      | charging stand because that allows them to not have to use the [[MagSafe]] stuff. But I'll                   |
| 15:45      | see if I can find a link to it. It's not showing up unfortunately immediately on the website             |
| 15:49      | for me, which is a little bit of a shame, but I'm, I'm sure it's just hiding somewhere.                  |
| 15:55      | So I'll have to take a look and see what I can find.                                                     |
| 15:58      | Yeah. I'm generally a fan of Anker products. I feel like it's like a reliable company.                  |
| 16:03      | Yes. Yeah. It really is. And honestly, my, my charging, my charger is really good. I,                    |
| 16:08      | I like it. It's got, um, uh, why it's got a T charger in the base and then it's got                      |
| 16:13      | the magnetic charger above. So you can put like your AirPods on the base as well. And                    |
| 16:18      | I've found just sort of littering these two and one or three and one stands around my                    |
| 16:21      | home is the way to make sure that things actually get charged and stay charged. Um, I do quite           |
| 16:27      | like Anker. Do you have a new, new version, um, in their MagGo lineup, um, where they've                |
| 16:34      | got the, um, uh, it's a, uh, battery magnetic charger. So the actual magnetic charging part              |
| 16:41      | that you connect your phone to is also a battery. So you can just slide it up and out and take           |
| 16:46      | it with you, which means that the battery is always charged. Um, and I really like that.                 |
| 16:51      | Um, I think, uh, what I'm seeing is the closest that they have to, to my, um, charger at the             |
| 16:57      | moment is the Anker 533 magnetic wireless charger three in one stand, which is 59.99.                   |
| 17:04      | But don't forget Anker stuff always goes on sale. Um, and it's got a Mac, it's sort                     |
| 17:09      | of a [[MagSafe]] charger for your iPhone or [[MagSafe]] like, um, and, uh, the AirPods charger in                |
| 17:15      | the base and a space for your Apple Watch charger. You'll have to provide your own cable,                |
| 17:19      | but it looks pretty similar. So I'll make sure that we pop a link to that into our show                  |
| 17:23      | notes for folks.                                                                                         |
| 17:24      | I like the 12 South one too. Just looking here as we talk, they've got one where it                      |
| 17:29      | incorporates the [[MagSafe]] puck. So, and it allows you to adjust the angle so you can like adjust          |
| 17:37      | it or you even turn it.                                                                                  |
| 17:38      | Oh, the high rise one. Um, is that it is called a 12 South 40 for iPhone.                                |
| 17:46      | Oh, nice. I'll get a link to that in show notes because I like their high rise. That's                   |
| 17:52      | also a three in one charging stand. Um, it's got like the, you pop the Apple Watch on the                |
| 17:57      | back of it. Um, there's the AirPods charger in the base and then your phone magnetises                   |
| 18:01      | to the front.                                                                                            |
| 18:02      | Oh man, that's nice too. But that one's a little expensive, but yeah, it is, but it's                    |
| 18:06      | currently on sale for $20 less, which, um, you know, 12 South products don't go on sale                  |
| 18:11      | quite as much as the, um, uh,                                                                            |
| 18:15      | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| 18:16      | What are we doing here guys? I, well, that's going to cost me a little bit.                              |
| 18:20      | Enabling David, that's what we're doing. Yeah, clearly, clearly. I like the fact that the                |
| 18:24      | Forte has a separate Apple Watch charger as a side note. Um, but yeah, I'll put links                    |
| 18:28      | to the studio neat, um, stuff and, uh, the 12 South options in our show notes for everyone               |
| 18:34      | so that they can go and have a look. The only thing I don't like about Anker is how quickly             |
| 18:38      | they changed their product lineup. It feels like I did not get this charger that long                    |
| 18:41      | ago, but it just doesn't exist on the website anymore.                                                   |
| 18:44      | Yeah. All right. Well, well, I'm going to put a pin in that one, but the, uh, yeah,                      |
| 18:49      | so, you know, kind of getting back to the feature, you can put widgets on the home screen                |
| 18:53      | if you get the pro watch, the pro phone, that's at least the speculations. We record this                |
| 18:57      | and I think very likely that you will be able to have that always on. And so suddenly                    |
| 19:03      | your phone can become a little status display to you as you're sitting there working and                 |
| 19:08      | charged at the same time. So I, I'm a big fan and I, uh, I think that's going to be                      |
| 19:13      | a great feature.                                                                                         |

| 19:25      | an app for everything these days. Some are great and others not so much. So how do you                   |
| 19:30      | quickly find the right one for you? A great way to discover new quality apps and get all                 |
| 19:34      | the tools you need to get the work done is set up a subscription for Mac and iPhone apps.                |
| 19:40      | Set up packs over 240 high quality apps into one. There's an app for almost any task. So                 |

| 20:00      | just one flat monthly fee. New apps are added to set up regularly. Updates are free and                  |
| 20:05      | all the apps are full featured pro versions. I think it's hilarious in that people recommend             |
| 20:11      | apps to me like people who I know who love an app. And so often I find the app and set                   |
| 20:16      | up. So I'm already, I've already got access to the app with my set up subscription. And                  |
| 20:20      | I didn't even know I had it. So I go in and download it. And so often it's true. And I                   |
| 20:24      | add it to the mix. Now until September 15, if you use the code, automators, A U T O M                    |

| 20:46      | thanks to set up for the support of the automators and all of relay FM.                                  |
| 20:51      | All right, we went down a little bit of rabbit hole. Let's talk about some automation. We                |
| 20:57      | had started, we started with the Sherlock automations.                                                   |
| 20:59      | Yeah. Yeah. And then we got a little sidetracked though. I mean, tying back into the automation          |
| 21:05      | theme, I feel I should mention, you know, there's a lot of app developers of the apps                    |
| 21:08      | that we know and love and talk about all the time who are releasing lock screen widgets,                 |
| 21:12      | which will enable you to get your automations in front of your face. And the notable lock                |
| 21:18      | screen widget that's missing is shortcuts. There is no shortcut widget for the lock screen,              |
| 21:24      | but I'm pleased to report that I've been talking to some folks and the folks over at                     |
| 21:29      | launcher are actually doing this for us. They are letting you add your own lock screen widgets,          |
| 21:34      | which will run a shortcut. So, you know, that's, they're hoping to get that out with iOS 16.             |
| 21:40      | Obviously, App Store review could possibly be the failure point there. I know that they're               |
| 21:45      | going to work as hard as they can on it, but I've been trying the beta and it's awesome.                 |
| 21:49      | You know, just being able to give myself a button that I can tap it and it'll do whatever                |
| 21:53      | it is that I need it to do. It's great. I'm not sure Apple would do it because it seems                  |
| 21:59      | to me like, you know, shortcuts is interactive and the whole idea of these lock screen widgets           |
| 22:03      | is to be passive. Yeah. But equally, they'll let you run it from a double tap on the back                |
| 22:08      | of your iPhone, which is incredibly easy to accidentally trigger. So, you know, I don't                  |
| 22:14      | know what's happening there, but I feel like maybe this ties in with some of the other                   |
| 22:19      | missing in action features, which aren't unfortunately in shortcuts yet. You know, we got the ability    |
| 22:25      | to send email later, but not through a shortcut. We got medication tracking, not in shortcuts.           |
| 22:31      | We got stops and maps, but we can't add them in shortcuts. And those are the three things                |
| 22:37      | that stand out to me as kind of like missing and are very much on my wish list. And I'm                  |
| 22:41      | really hoping they don't go into the iOS 17 bucket. Please, anybody at Apple who's listening,            |
| 22:47      | who has influence who can help make this happen, like give them apps team and the mail team              |
| 22:51      | and the health team some support and integrating the stuff, please. You know, but, you know,             |
| 22:57      | other than that, yeah, there's only about like 500 new shortcut sections, David. Yeah,                   |
| 23:01      | we'll cover that in an hour, right? Yeah, I can I start with mail because I am there's                   |
| 23:06      | one here in particular that I'm very excited about. And that is an [[Apple Mail]]. If you use                |
| 23:12      | Apple Mail, you can now configure it so it can open a specific mailbox. And this is a                    |
| 23:19      | feature that we had in earlier iterations of shortcuts. But to make it happen was one                    |
| 23:24      | of those things where you threw salt over your left shoulder and spun around three times.                |
| 23:28      | You had to the trick was you went into Apple Mail, you just kept opening the mailbox and                 |
| 23:32      | eventually if you went in the shortcuts app, it would spit up a selected or a recommended                |
| 23:38      | action of saying, well, open the MacSparky inbox, you keep opening that one. So do you                  |
| 23:42      | want to do that? And then it went away. And like I included it in the one of the original                |
| 23:47      | iterations of the shortcuts for iPhone field guide and people started writing me saying,                 |
| 23:52      | oh, this will happen. This doesn't work anymore. And Apple for whatever reason just really               |
| 23:56      | didn't address it. And I guess maybe it stopped watching mail. It may have been a privacy                |
| 24:02      | or a security thing. But now they have an action where you can say, open this particular                 |
| 24:06      | mailbox, you don't have to throw salt anymore. You just throw in an action and you're off                |
| 24:12      | to the races. I love that.                                                                               |
| 24:14      | Yes. Yeah. Well, I think what this really is is, you know, this is a reflection of the                   |
| 24:19      | change that they've made to make it easier for all developers to add actions to their                    |
| 24:23      | shortcuts. And when when custom shortcuts actions first came out, they were kind of                      |
| 24:27      | talking about this whole like donating based on usage. So like, as you do things more frequently,        |
| 24:32      | those actions appear. And how what is frequent? How do you define frequent? Well, I mean,                |
| 24:40      | that that's a question, you know, how long is a piece of string? Is there string? Does                   |
| 24:43      | string exist? Is it string theory, perhaps? These questions were the ones that app developers            |
| 24:48      | were attempting to answer for themselves. And some app developers went, hey, a person                    |
| 24:53      | does this, I'm going to just say they can get a shortcut action for it if they do it                     |
| 24:56      | once. Yeah. Some other app developers just like, yeah, if they tap on this button, I'm                   |
| 25:00      | just going to donate the action. And that'll be it. And others, you know, we're trying                   |
| 25:06      | to do very careful like watching usage and recommending things. And I feel like the mail                 |
| 25:11      | team probably really overthought it. And they were watching and then they went, oh, they're              |
| 25:16      | maybe not opening this mailbox quite as frequently at the moment, I'm going to undone that action.       |
| 25:22      | And then the problem with undone and action is it doesn't show up anymore. And you can                   |
| 25:25      | copy and paste it from old shortcuts. But I feel like it got a new ID when it got re-added.              |
| 25:31      | And then like the old one stopped working. And oh, God, yeah, it was it was a mess. But                  |
| 25:36      | I feel like we've had some really good updates here, which is really going to help us out                |
| 25:40      | because, you know, mail's got so many new actions that it's just great, you know, aside                  |
| 25:47      | from not being able to send send an email later, it feels like we've got new features                    |
| 25:53      | in mail that are really helpful to people, like being able to, you know, remind me of                    |
| 25:58      | something later. But the fact that we have, you know, open specific mailboxes, open the                  |
| 26:03      | VIP mailbox, and setting our focus filters through shortcuts, which we'll have to get                    |
| 26:08      | to in a future episode if we ever want to finish here today. You know, that they've                      |
| 26:14      | really integrated it into, you know, the automation experience. And I'm really excited by that.          |
| 26:21      | Yeah, I mean, it's a it's a good argument for using mail, which haven't been many of                     |
| 26:26      | those for a while. And no, no, I'm actually using mail again, like now, because I can                    |
| 26:33      | actually say, Hey, open a specific mailbox, and I can also filter my mailboxes based on                  |
| 26:37      | my focus mode, which, you know, that that to me makes mail usable, because I like to have                |
| 26:43      | all my email in one place. But if I'm not working, I don't want to see my work email.                    |
| 26:46      | Yeah, while I'm working, I don't necessarily want to have like all of my other mail front                |
| 26:51      | and centre. I want it there so I can go look for it if I need it. But I don't want to be focusing        |
| 26:57      | on it. I don't want that to be the default when I open the app. And now now I have that option.          |
| 27:01      | And what I really like, thanks to the open mail, open mailbox action is that I can have                  |
| 27:08      | different home screen buttons for different mail accounts. So I can actually, you know,                  |
| 27:13      | have two mail apps, big air quotes there, in certain focus modes, which will just take me                |
| 27:20      | to specific inboxes, so that I can, you know, handle whatever it is that I'm up to appropriately.        |
| 27:27      | And it's also this, this new action is really good for mode shifting. If you just want to say,           |
| 27:32      | I want to start, you know, answering customer service email, and then it can set a timer and             |
| 27:38      | timer and it can open the inbox and it can play some nice music, you can, it's really kind of like       |
| 27:43      | the ideal situation. So we've had this long hiatus in new features in Apple Mail. And,                   |
| 27:50      | you know, I have my own theory on it. I think they were working on security for a long time,             |
| 27:54      | but for whatever reason, I think now they're starting to turn their attention on more UI                 |
| 27:59      | and user focused features. So we got a bunch this year, you know, send later and some other stuff.       |
| 28:05      | Do you think this is like a one and done, like they, they're going to leave mail us to stagnate          |
| 28:10      | again? Or do you think this is going to be the beginning of like additional features like we             |
| 28:15      | got with Apple notes and [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]]? I'm going to be optimistic and say this is the beginning of a        |
| 28:21      | new chapter of automation focused mail. Me too. You know, I'm not 100% certain it is, but I feel         |
| 28:27      | like they've, they've really been listening to user feedback and they've looked at the features          |
| 28:31      | that other people are using other mail apps for, you know, they've not implemented snooze,               |
| 28:37      | they've implemented remind me later because this is Apple and they always have to do their own           |
| 28:42      | special thing. But equally, you know, actually snoozing mail sometimes is not what I want.               |
| 28:49      | Sometimes it is what I want. I want to just hide it until a specific date, sort of like a GTD            |
| 28:55      | tickler thing. But sometimes it's just that, you know, like I need, like I need to like still have       |
| 29:01      | this around, but I just want to be reminded about this on Tuesday, because I'm not working right         |
| 29:06      | now and I'll deal with this later type thing. But, you know, and, and so, you know, it's good            |
| 29:11      | that we've got that hopefully we will get actual snooze at some point that would be really good.         |
| 29:15      | Please Apple like just archive it temporarily or something, whatever, you know, add a snooze             |
| 29:21      | folder, be like every other mail client and add your own folders to things. It's fine. But yeah,         |
| 29:27      | we'll see. But I'm optimistic this is going to be the new chapter of Apple Mail.                         |
| 29:32      | Yeah, I tend to agree. I feel like they they're moving now, they're not going to stop. And,              |
| 29:38      | and you know, the people working on Apple Mail want to put these features in, right? It's not            |
| 29:42      | like they're being jerks about it. I think they've just probably been really busy with other stuff.      |
| 29:48      | But I really hope this is the beginning. Yeah, well, I think it's just like the folks over on            |
| 29:52      | the iWork team. It's not that they didn't want to add mail merge back. It was that they had to deal      |
| 29:56      | with all the other things. And probably a whole bunch of groundwork that they had to lay for a           |
| 30:02      | number of other things that they could do before they could reimplement mail merge after taking          |
| 30:07      | it out. And now we've got an amazing mail merge. Thanks, great folks at iWork, which, you know,          |
| 30:12      | is better than what we had before. And I can do it even on my iPhone. So hopefully the mail team         |
| 30:17      | has just been, you know, laying a lot of groundwork and updating things here and there and getting       |
| 30:22      | everything, you know, into the state where they can then just continually add awesome great new          |
| 30:28      | features on a regular basis. Go vertical. Yeah. Yeah. If their implementation of the focus modes         |
| 30:35      | is anything to go by, I'm going to be very, very optimistic there.                                       |
| 30:38      | All right. So I talked a minute ago about Apple Notes. And Apple Notes right now seems to be kind        |
| 30:43      | of like the poster child for this new, you know, strategy for the native apps of like,                   |
| 30:49      | let's slowly get them better every year. Apple Notes has been on that slow climb. I mean,                |
| 30:54      | I remember with, you know, it was a joke with all of its Comic Sans glory for so long. And then one      |
| 31:01      | year all of a sudden Apple Notes was just better. And then they didn't stop. And there's a lot of        |
| 31:06      | people who have completely replaced services like Evernote at this point with Apple Notes.               |
| 31:12      | But I have always complained in you as well that there's not enough automation in Apple Notes. I         |
| 31:18      | mean, it's like this shortcuts were always a little bit behind. Well, this is the year                   |
| 31:22      | because Apple Notes got a lot of love from shortcuts this year.                                          |
| 31:28      | Yeah. Yeah, it did. You know, they've just really updated all of it to make it so much easier,           |
| 31:35      | I think. And this is, you know, evidenced with, you know, there's the number of new actions,             |
| 31:42      | which really are power user features, but they're not just for power users. You know,                    |
| 31:48      | like creating a tag is something that, you know, okay, only a power user is going to put that into       |
| 31:54      | an automation. Are you sure? Like somebody who's trying to do like a project setup to make it            |
| 32:00      | really easy for themselves, like being able to create any folder in Apple Notes and create a new         |
| 32:05      | tag with, you know, specific, you know, sub tags, perhaps, you know, however they want to do that        |
| 32:10      | and moving notes that already exist into a folder, things like that and removing a note attack from      |
| 32:16      | a note if they've decided that, hey, all the things in this category are no longer, you know,            |
| 32:21      | relevant to that, you can do all of that now. And that's just so amazing.                                |
| 32:27      | Yeah, I mean, what they've done is they've just given you almost complete control with automation        |
| 32:33      | of almost anything you could do in the app with your finger in iOS 15. And can we just, let's put        |
| 32:41      | a pin in Apple, let's just talk about this big change with donation of automation actions and            |
| 32:48      | how that's changed. You as a developer, maybe you're probably best suited to explain it, but             |
| 32:54      | they have dramatically simplified the process for app developers.                                        |
| 32:59      | Yes. Yeah. So previously, and I've attempted to do this multiple times before,                           |
| 33:03      | creating a shortcut action as a developer was a considerably less than fun, pleasant, or easy            |
| 33:10      | experience. It was so incredibly unintuitive in many ways. Like, I'm sure once you got your              |
| 33:17      | head around it and did it, it was fine. But for me coming in as somebody who didn't have an iOS app,     |
| 33:26      | and you know, I speak [[Swift]] and Objective C to an extent, I'm sure some of my code would make            |
| 33:32      | other developers cry, but that is the case with any developer writing code. I'm sure somebody            |
| 33:36      | out there will hate it. But I would look at it and go, okay, I have a shortcut here from a similar       |
| 33:43      | thing that does something very similar to what I want to do. So I'm going to create a new shortcut       |
| 33:47      | action. And an hour and a half later, I would still not have a shortcut action. And I would have         |
| 33:53      | just no idea why and I just give up and go any, you know, a very large bar of chocolate. And now         |
| 33:58      | they've actually made it easy. Like, not just easy, intuitive, and simple. And there are app             |
| 34:04      | developers out there going, yep, love this really easy. Yeah, so I just implemented it all in like       |
| 34:10      | an hour. And I've got 20 shortcut sections now, we're good. So they've just simplified it so much,       |
| 34:16      | you know, consider it like a change from like having the entire Encyclopedia Britannica as your          |
| 34:22      | instruction manual to having a three page IKEA diagram. Like that's kind of the sort of scale            |
| 34:29      | of simplicity that we're talking about now when they've when they've made it for adding these            |
| 34:33      | actions. Now, tell me if I'm wrong, but as I understand it, basically, any call that your                |
| 34:40      | app makes, you can attach it to a shortcut, I guess, with some, of course, with some                     |
| 34:46      | limitation. But in general, you can take basically anything your app does and say, oh,                   |
| 34:51      | this is a good idea, I'm going to make this a shortcut and you check a box. Is it that?                  |
| 34:56      | It's not quite that simple. And it isn't check a box. But it is a lot easier than it used to             |
| 35:03      | be. They've not quite made it possible to attach to any call because I mean, everything technically      |
| 35:11      | is a call in programming terms, if you if you trace it right back down to the operating system           |
| 35:15      | route and beyond. But they have made it much easier to create app shortcuts. And, you know,              |
| 35:24      | there's an app shortcuts provider shortcut definition and the buttons and tip views. So                  |
| 35:30      | like the, the name that people use and so on. And not only that, but they've also pretty much            |
| 35:38      | solved the chicken and the egg problem. Because they had the same problem that Microsoft Store           |
| 35:43      | had, you know, back when there was a Windows phone. And if I remember that, there were no apps on        |
| 35:48      | the Windows phone because there were no users. And there were no users on the Windows phone              |
| 35:51      | because there were no apps. Well, guess what, a whole bunch of apps didn't have shortcuts actions        |
| 35:56      | because users aren't going to find that users aren't going to use that that's not going to be            |
| 36:00      | something that they want. And users weren't going to use the shortcuts app, because they didn't have     |
| 36:04      | the actions that they wanted, you know, they go in and they type in the name of their their car          |
| 36:09      | parking app, and it just wouldn't have an action. And they've solved that by giving us a section         |
| 36:16      | in so if you go to the shortcuts tab, which was previously called my shortcuts, it's not just            |
| 36:21      | called shortcuts. And then you go to the folders view. You know, so from from like all shortcuts         |
| 36:27      | or one of your folders, if you go backwards on the iPhone or just look in the left tab on your Mac,      |
| 36:33      | you'll see a new section called app shortcuts, which are guess what, there's one one action              |
| 36:37      | shortcuts that you had before. And voice memos is in there. That's the the Apple demo, which has         |
| 36:44      | two actions, or two shortcuts, record voice memo, and play last voice memo. And when you open those,     |
| 36:51      | it does just, you know, do exactly what you would expect it to do. But you can then like it looks        |
| 36:59      | like a shortcut, but it's an action. And some other developers have got things in here as well,          |
| 37:03      | you know, like, hey, fancy that [[Drafts]] drafts has got actions in shortcuts, who knew. But they've        |
| 37:09      | got, you know, it allows the developers to make it really easy. And it's not in that area before         |
| 37:14      | where it was in the gallery. And I've just tapped the gallery, and I've got a loading screen.            |
| 37:18      | Yeah. And you had to wait for it to load. And then you had to kind of scroll down. And then              |
| 37:23      | you would find a section called shortcuts from your apps. And it was really hidden that that's           |
| 37:29      | kind of gone now. And I'm glad that it's a lot easier for our developers to get on to, you know,         |
| 37:37      | the main screen of shortcuts now. Of course, you know, if you go and look inside of the actions,         |
| 37:42      | so many actions, so many great actions, shortcuts has added new actions even.                            |
| 37:46      | But, you know, this is still, you know, a good improvement, I would say, you know,                       |
| 37:51      | I've got a I've got an app here that I'm [[TestFlight]]ing. And I'm really pleased to see that              |
| 37:55      | it's got shortcuts actions in that section. So it's, it just makes sense to me. And I also like          |
| 38:01      | the fact that when I tap it, it doesn't walk me through a whole flow of adding it, it just runs          |
| 38:05      | it. Like, what is this going to do? I tap on the record voice memo, and it just doesn't. So yeah,        |
| 38:10      | they've they've really solved the chicken and the egg problem, and that developers aren't going to       |
| 38:14      | spend a whole bunch of time implementing something because nobody's going to use it. And they're         |
| 38:18      | never going to find it anyway. To we've made this quick and easy and much easier for users to discover.  |
| 38:24      | And now we have more chickens and more eggs. And that's the goal, right? I mean, so it's easier          |
| 38:29      | for users to find it, it's easier for developers to make it. And I really like kind of the emphasis      |
| 38:35      | on simple automations. I really think that is the the magic key to this stuff. There's a reason why      |
| 38:41      | when we do the show, we have guests, we always ask for a simple automation in addition to a complex      |
| 38:46      | when everybody wants to show off, right? And give you their 30 action shortcut, which is cool.           |
| 38:52      | But you know, what people really need, honestly, is one to three action shortcuts that just solve        |
| 38:56      | a problem for them. Those are the ones that are going to get used. And I think Apple is really           |
| 39:00      | leaning into that. And so, you know, getting so returning to notes, notes, the development team          |
| 39:08      | on notes was must must have been the, you know, the canary for this, because they went in and            |
| 39:13      | they did that they went they took the effort and like delete note pin note open notes account. So        |
| 39:18      | you can change your notes account with a shortcut, change the settings of the app. I mean, there's       |
| 39:23      | never been shortcuts that allow you to change an app settings. But now there are no delete               |
| 39:28      | delete folders. So folder management, create folders, move notes to folders, you know,                   |
| 39:34      | Rose was talking earlier about tags. I mean, they have really done a great job of taking so many         |
| 39:40      | of the features that you would normally have to do by tapping on the screen and giving you               |
| 39:45      | shortcuts action so you can automate a bunch of this. And you know, then it's up to you to go            |
| 39:49      | figure out how you're going to string this stuff together. Maybe you have maybe use Apple notes          |
| 39:55      | as like a depository of information. It's your own personal version of [[Obsidian]] or [[Craft]]. And            |
| 40:02      | you go ahead and every time you get a new client, you give them a folder. Well,                          |
| 40:05      | now you can create that folder in the same process of as part of a bigger shortcut. And                  |
| 40:11      | I'm really excited about that, you know. Yeah, I mean, I'm just imagining like a whole new project       |
| 40:18      | workflow. Okay, and I kind of feel like this is a shortcut that Apple ought to make and put in the       |
| 40:22      | shortcuts gallery, because like, imagine it pops up and it asks you, Hey, what's the new project?        |
| 40:28      | And so you type in the project name or you speak the project name, depending on how you've,              |
| 40:32      | you know, implemented or called the shortcut. And then it goes off and it creates a folder               |
| 40:37      | and Apple notes, it creates a list of reminders. And, you know, it adds a new pinned note in that        |
| 40:43      | Apple in the Apple notes folder with project setup with a whole bunch of checkboxes in there.            |
| 40:50      | And, you know, adds the tag project setup to that. And then, you know, it creates a new                  |
| 40:58      | tab group for that project. And, you know, that just right there is really, really simple. It's          |
| 41:05      | only a couple of actions. But imagine how much time that would save somebody. You know, they'd           |
| 41:10      | have, you know, their standard, you know, project setup list, which they, which they always use          |
| 41:14      | to set up a project. And that's just been pinned for them in a note in notes. And they've now            |
| 41:19      | got a [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] list for this. They've got a tab group. So when they're looking at links,                |
| 41:22      | oh, right, I can send that over to the tab group for this project, perfect, done.                        |
| 41:26      | That's so simple, but so useful to people. And I feel like, you know, this is why                        |
| 41:33      | the Apple stuff implementing good shortcut sections is really so critical. Because a lot of people       |
| 41:41      | will just try and do stuff with the native apps, and they're not going to go looking for something       |
| 41:46      | else. If they don't think that it's even vaguely going to be possible. Whereas if they get the           |
| 41:50      | idea that there's a possibility that they could tap a button or speak a phrase, and then just add        |
| 41:56      | a few details, then, and suddenly they've got a whole project set up ready for them. Well, that's        |
| 42:02      | pretty cool. So if you use Apple notes, I strongly recommend, as soon as you get this installed as       |
| 42:08      | iOS 16, go in shortcuts and take a look at all the actions for notes. Because I suspect you'll           |
| 42:13      | find new ways to automate if you do. This episode of Automators is brought to you by TextExpander.       |

| 44:17      | We've been going a little slow so far, but it's because we're, you know, kind of getting this            |
| 44:21      | underlying technology change, which is going to change everything. I mean, we're giving you the          |
| 44:26      | new actions that are shipping, but I expect a lot of our favourite apps are going to be jumping on        |
| 44:31      | this bandwagon, and then we're going to have this explosion of new actions. And that is exactly          |
| 44:36      | what we're looking for. [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] didn't get as much love. You've got a few things there.                |
| 44:42      | You can... Yeah, I mean, you've got the ability to create a list in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]], which is a much           |
| 44:48      | underrated action, I think. Just being able to create a new [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] list, you know, I mentioned        |
| 44:53      | before in the example project, new project shortcut, you would be able to, you know,                     |
| 44:59      | actually create a [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] list for your specific project now. And that is something that you just,     |
| 45:03      | you couldn't do before. And I'm really glad that you can. And it's, of course, also got the same         |
| 45:10      | focus mode integration, the other apps that have got... So anything that integrates with focus modes,    |
| 45:18      | I believe actually does get a shortcut action for free pretty much because they get that,                |
| 45:24      | that, you know, set this focus filter, which is really nice. But, you know, the fact that you            |
| 45:30      | can just create a new list in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] now is great. And, you know, you can nest things as well         |
| 45:37      | with [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]]. So, you know, back to that project setup that I mentioned, you know, you can create      |
| 45:43      | a list and then have a task in it called Setup and then create nested subtasks underneath that           |
| 45:50      | setup task. So, you know, you can really go pretty far with [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] now. And you can open a specific   |
| 45:57      | smart list and you can create your own smart list now and unpin the original smart lists.                |
| 46:01      | So if you want to, you know, have your own views, which are important to you in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]],               |
| 46:06      | you can take advantage of that. And I feel like actually being able to open a new smart list             |
| 46:12      | or any smart list is actually very important for folks.                                                  |
| 46:17      | Yeah. Do you have, and maybe you just answered my question with the subroutines, but do you have a       |
| 46:22      | workflow yet to create a new list and then add items to that list in the same shortcut? Because,         |
| 46:28      | like historically, you'd already have to have the list in existence so you could refer to it,            |
| 46:33      | but when you create the shortcut, it doesn't know the name of the list yet because you haven't made      |
| 46:37      | it yet. Yes. So, I believe what I did, and now I'm just looking to see if I can do that.                 |
| 46:44      | But what I did was I, yeah, I just used the output of the create list action. So if you tap              |
| 46:51      | and hold on the list of, or the selected list, yeah, and then you can do the magic variable              |
| 46:58      | and you can actually have your list in there, which is really, really useful.                            |
| 47:01      | That was not there earlier, I'll tell you, because I remember banging my head into that.                 |
| 47:06      | Yeah, I think that's new. So yeah, that's very cool. And they also, like, it's not in shortcuts,         |
| 47:12      | which is a shame. And I feel like the [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] team need a little bit of a tap on the shoulder          |
| 47:15      | and going, hey, you remember that thing called shortcuts? Templates, templates exist in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]]        |
| 47:21      | now. And so you can create a template from any list and save it as a template. And I don't know,         |
| 47:30      | maybe I actually have to have a template to be able to use this inside of shortcuts,                     |
| 47:39      | but it would be really nice if I could create update and use my templates from shortcuts                 |
| 47:46      | within [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]]. Maybe that's coming later. But I guess we'll see. But as it is, they've added          |
| 47:52      | some automation, even if they didn't put it in shortcuts.                                                |
| 47:56      | But you can kind of brute force your way around that by coding your template into shortcuts.             |
| 48:01      | So if you had a list of things every time you do the monthly report and rather than make it              |
| 48:09      | template in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]], you could just create a shortcut that says create list called monthly             |
| 48:14      | report. And then under that, using the trick we just talked about, add the four or five tasks to         |
| 48:20      | that. And these run the shortcut and it creates it for you. So templates it via shortcuts as             |
| 48:25      | opposed to the built-in template system. Yeah, the limitation there is your nested tasks. Like,          |
| 48:29      | if you want to use a lot of nested reminders, then it's doable in shortcuts, to be clear.                |
| 48:37      | You definitely can do it. It is just not intuitive at all, especially if you want to do it in a          |
| 48:44      | really nice efficient way, where at the top you've just got a text action, which has a list              |
| 48:48      | of your reminders in with a tab indent in front of the ones that are within the parent one.              |
| 48:55      | There is no easy way to automate that in shortcuts, unfortunately, other than just                       |
| 49:00      | hey, and then get this reminder and then use that as the parent for these, which it's just not as        |
| 49:08      | nice as it could be. So it would be really nice if we actually had full access to our                    |
| 49:12      | templates inside of shortcuts. Are you still doing your task management on me focus?                     |
| 49:17      | Yes, yes, I am. Yeah, me too. I've been looking at the other options out there. I thought,               |
| 49:22      | well, no, I'm no longer a lawyer. Maybe I can use something less intense                                 |
| 49:25      | that I just love OmniFocus. Anything that doesn't have a defer date,                                     |
| 49:30      | unfortunately, no longer works for me. OmniFocus has ruined me for all other apps. The fact that I       |
| 49:36      | can defer things and have a due date and the automations as well. I really love the fact that            |
| 49:42      | I have automations that just go in. So I add things from various stores into my OmniFocus inbox,         |
| 49:50      | and then they get magically screwed away by an automation script that just tags them with the            |
| 49:55      | right store name, cleans up the title, and puts them in a shopping project, which is a single            |
| 50:01      | action list. And then whenever I go past that store, I have a geolocation set on the tag.                |
| 50:07      | So I get reminded, but only if there's things on the list. And honestly, I'm ruined for everything       |
| 50:13      | else because of that. And they have that review mechanism, and you can URL link anything. For            |
| 50:19      | me, with the contextual computing thing I do, having links to not just tasks, but projects and           |
| 50:27      | contexts, it really kind of makes my whole thing work. But I do feel like [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] is creeping          |
| 50:35      | up and to the extent that things that are less intense than OmniFocus are getting gobbled up             |
| 50:41      | by [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] at this point, because it just keeps getting more and more features every year. So          |
| 50:45      | if you haven't looked at [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] in a while, and you don't want something like OmniFocus,              |
| 50:51      | you should take a look at [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]]. I think it's really good.                                           |
| 50:54      | Yeah. Yeah. I'm very impressed with [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]]. The team there have been working really hard              |
| 51:00      | into making it into a really good task management app that is still simple. So yeah,                     |
| 51:06      | just get those templates and shortcuts for me. And I'll give it another whirl.                           |
| 51:09      | What about [[Safari]]? What are you excited about with new actions in [[Safari]]?                                |
| 51:13      | Tab groups. We got tab groups. So you can create a tab group. You can open a tab group.                  |
| 51:18      | And of course, tab groups are linked into the focus modes, filters, which we'll get to in a              |
| 51:24      | future episode. But it's just really great that tab groups have shortcut support now.                    |
| 51:30      | So I have various shortcuts that I use, and they're sort of ephemeral. They come and they go             |
| 51:36      | based on what I'm up to. So at the moment, I'm taking a week off actually next week as we record         |
| 51:41      | this episode. And I've got a whole bunch of DIY and home projects that I want to do, like I'm            |
| 51:47      | installing some new smart lights in my bedroom. I've got built-in alcoves in the corner. I've            |
| 51:53      | got cupboards above my bed going down to little nightstands on the side of the bed,                      |
| 51:58      | and there's a little alcove area in there with some shelves. So I'm putting in integrated                |
| 52:01      | lighting, of course. But this is me. It's smart lighting, of course it is. So I've got links to          |
| 52:08      | some of the things for stuff like that. And I'm just able to put it all into a tab group really          |
| 52:12      | easily. And now I can actually create and open those tab groups with specific [[Safari]] actions,            |
| 52:18      | which means that I have a home screen right now set up for that week off with,                           |
| 52:25      | it's got a widget for my playlist and so on. And then it's also got some                                 |
| 52:30      | shortcut actions to take me right to specific focus modes or filters. And that includes tab              |
| 52:37      | groups. And that's just really cool that I can go to a specific tab group, because previously you        |
| 52:42      | just, you couldn't go to a tab group. You couldn't really do anything with them. And now not only        |
| 52:48      | that, but you can also open new tabs, new private tabs, and you know, that it's just great stuff.        |
| 52:55      | Yeah, the way a focus mode has tied into everything is the reason why we're doing                        |
| 52:58      | it a separate show. But it is really remarkable. And they are like trying to make a system where         |
| 53:05      | you can stay focused, which is really the goal here. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it almost feels like            |
| 53:12      | it's the opposite of the device, you know, what the device is intended to do, right? A phone is          |
| 53:19      | intended, like, a phoning is a synchronous communication. So if I call you, you have to                  |
| 53:25      | stop what you're doing and then pick it up and talk to me. But they're really trying to make             |
| 53:28      | it into a device that meets your needs at that moment, whatever those needs might be. And                |
| 53:35      | it's, it's just really great to see that all of the things are really coming together. I've also         |
| 53:41      | noticed David was something that has appeared recently, which I hadn't noticed until now.                |
| 53:46      | Find bookmarks and open bookmark are shortcut sections. Yeah. So, you know, I, this is great             |
| 53:53      | because I've been, I've been having a little bit of a problem in that I've got the same data saved       |
| 53:57      | in a couple of different places because I need access to it in different places. And like,               |
| 54:02      | it's links to things like the links to the Google Drive folder for all of our automated show notes       |
| 54:07      | or the Google sheet for iOS today and things like that. Because if I have them in a bookmark,            |
| 54:13      | I can't get at them and on other devices and so on. So I can't easily build them into                    |
| 54:18      | focus mode things or bunches or whatever it is. But they've now added find bookmarks and open            |
| 54:23      | bookmark as shortcuts actions, which allows me to now have a single action shortcut that just opens      |
| 54:30      | a specific bookmark so that I can, you know, go to whatever it is that I need. And of course,            |
| 54:37      | you can also close tabs and find tabs and, and all of that. So I'm, you know, this is,                   |
| 54:44      | this is really good work from the [[Safari]] team. I'm really impressed. They've                             |
| 54:47      | snuck in a couple of features that I hadn't realised were there. And you can also toggle                 |
| 54:52      | like a read of you now in [[Safari]], which is great. So yeah, I'm just, I'm loving it. It's so good.        |
| 54:59      | And like browser setups and contexts are things I've historically done in [[Keyboard Maestro]],              |
| 55:04      | which tied me to the Mac. And now with these tools coming in, I can actually rewrite these               |
| 55:09      | into shortcuts and use them on an iPad or a phone or Mac, you know, I can use them on any device         |
| 55:14      | from Apple. And, you know, that's the kind of stuff I like. I like it to get my automation more          |
| 55:20      | mobile between my devices. So it doesn't matter which one I'm on. Yeah. Yeah. I've also just noticed     |
| 55:25      | they snuck in another one, David, find tab groups. I can get a list of all of my tab groups. This is     |
| 55:30      | great. Yeah, I don't know. Like maybe it just appeared in the latest beta. But who knows,                |
| 55:39      | there's probably going to be another beta while we're recording this knowing my luck.                    |
| 55:42      | But, you know, that, that's really good. I just wish [[Safari]] and [[Safari Technology Preview]] had            |
| 55:47      | the same tab groups that tripped me up the other day. I was trying to find a tab group that I            |
| 55:50      | created. And I realised it was in [[Safari Technology Preview]] instead of [[Safari]] and was able to get it     |
| 55:56      | on my other Mac, fortunately, but I wasn't able to get it on my iPhone. I might have to file some        |
| 56:01      | feedback about that and ask if we can share the folks, share our tab groups. But yeah, there's           |
| 56:07      | so many cool new actions here. I'm really glad I've just pulled this up. I've got my iOS 15 push cut     |
| 56:13      | automation server here, which should probably be running iOS 16 because there's a little beta            |
| 56:17      | out for that. But, you know, I've got one of them running iOS 15 and the other phone running             |
| 56:23      | iOS 16. So I'm just sitting here looking at them going, wait a second, when did bookmarks                |
| 56:28      | show up and all of these? So that's really cool. Yeah. And something we haven't said today that          |
| 56:33      | you should be aware of is not all of these actions are showing up on the iPad and iPhone                 |
| 56:38      | on the Mac. Unfortunately, I think particularly with the Mac, it seems like some of these actions,       |
| 56:44      | we got some new actions on the Mac that didn't show up anywhere else, but we also didn't get some        |
| 56:49      | of these actions over on the Mac. Like as of the last beta I checked on the Mac,                         |
| 56:55      | go to a specific Apple Mail mailbox is not available. I don't have a beta in front of me                 |
| 56:59      | right now, but I assume that's still the case. And it could just be a thing where they just              |
| 57:04      | haven't got there yet to implement it. You know, they haven't, they're not shipping that until           |
| 57:08      | maybe October. So, but there may be some hangups as you get this out into the public and actions         |
| 57:16      | aren't on your devices. Yeah. I mean, to be fair, people running Mac OS tend to be slower to upgrade     |
| 57:22      | than those running iOS. iOS people are much more likely to be aware of a big update sooner,              |
| 57:30      | to be honest. And it's also much less likely to break something that is considered a critical            |
| 57:35      | workflow. The way Mac apps work, you know, sometimes some developers just go, yeah, nah,                 |
| 57:42      | you can't like, I'm, I've just hard coded it and we're stopping support on devices or operating          |
| 57:49      | systems I've not yet tested for. And to be fair, you know, there are a lot of things that could          |
| 57:54      | change though. I have to say my bank app also does this. So if I try and launch my bank app on iOS 16,   |
| 58:00      | it just crashes. It doesn't tell me why. And I had to have a very long conversation with three           |
| 58:05      | different people at the bank before one of them finally understood that I just needed to know            |
| 58:09      | that there wasn't a problem with my bank account because I was completely unable to log in because       |
| 58:15      | they had locked me out on the device that was the secure authentication token. And they just crash       |
| 58:19      | it apparently when you're running a beta iOS. So that was a fun discussion when I found that out.        |
| 58:24      | And a long story short as I'm switching banks, but you know, it's, it's much less likely that            |
| 58:30      | somebody is going to update their Mac day one of a new operating system than it is they will their       |
| 58:34      | iPhone. Well, I will tell you one thing. I think somebody at Apple, high up, you know, I don't           |
| 58:40      | know, maybe, maybe it was Phil Schiller, but I know he's not, he's not as active. Somebody               |
| 58:45      | went somewhere and they parked their car and then they couldn't find it because now we have a bunch      |
| 58:50      | of support and maps to, to find your parked car. Yeah, you can mark your car as parked as well.          |
| 58:57      | And I think this is great when you've got like a rental car or something. If you've got Carplay          |
| 59:01      | in your main car and you're going, well, why would I want this? Well, just think of not having Carplay   |
| 59:05      | and if you rent a car, then you may not have Carplay or, you know, it, you are traveling with            |
| 59:12      | a friend and they don't have Carplay or Android play, but they, they frequently forget where             |
| 59:18      | they've parked their car. So now you can set your parked car, you can get the details of the parked      |
| 59:24      | car. And you can also get your parked car location. I'm not quite sure about the difference between      |
| 59:29      | details of your parked car and the parked car location is. I pulled that one up while we were,           |
| 59:36      | while you're re-talking. You can set the location, you can add notes, you can take a photo. I mean,      |
| 59:42      | it's just got a bunch of other details. Like I was thinking, like if you are going to Disneyland         |
| 59:47      | and you say, I am on the goofy level, you know, row seven, you know, section B, you know, so you         |
| 59:55      | could probably add details. Oh, that, that is really good because what I've been using for this          |
| 01:00:01   | instead is cheat sheet, which I've been able to use through shortcuts. It's got great shortcut           |
| 01:00:07   | support and I've, I've actually had it as a lock screen widget and I'm probably still going to keep      |
| 01:00:12   | that. But the fact that I can actually now add that into the shortcut information. So if I open          |
| 01:00:17   | up the maps app, it adds a little pin where you've parked your car. And yeah, I'm actually going to      |
| 01:00:22   | be able to, you know, have that on the pin, which is really cool as well as on my lock screen. So        |
| 01:00:27   | I'm really excited by that. And hopefully people will stop losing their car. I know some folks           |
| 01:00:33   | who don't have CarPlay will now just be able to stick like a little NFC tag in their car. And then       |
| 01:00:38   | you can tap your phone to it when you get out of the car and it'll just mark it as parked for you.       |
| 01:00:42   | That'll be great. And I'll have the correct location and everything.                                     |
| 01:00:45   | I was thinking about that. Yeah, like how much does that make sense as a shortcuts based automation?     |
| 01:00:52   | Like for instance, when Daisy and I park at Disneyland, we get out and just take a silly                 |
| 01:00:56   | picture in front of the sign of where we're parked next to. But you know, I could see, you know,         |
| 01:01:02   | like maybe building an automation around this. David, you have your Magic Bands, right? Do you           |
| 01:01:08   | wear your Magic Bands at Disney California too? No, but they're adding them not yet, but they will       |
| 01:01:14   | be. So I know where you're going here. Because my thought is, yeah, like the first time you tap          |
| 01:01:20   | your phone to your Magic Band in the day, it should prompt you to choose the picture of the car          |
| 01:01:27   | and get the location out of the picture of the car and mark the car as parked with the picture.          |
| 01:01:32   | Yeah, that would be very clever. Now, how would you do that so it only prompts you the first             |
| 01:01:36   | time? Because the second time I would tap it, I would want it to open the Disneyland app.                |
| 01:01:40   | Yeah. So the way I would do that is I would really simply just use [[Data Jar]] and every time                |
| 01:01:46   | you open the app, get the [[Data Jar]] variable, which will be like a Disney date or something,               |
| 01:01:55   | call it that. And if that, and then set that to today. Okay, but if it isn't, if the date isn't          |
| 01:02:01   | today, then you know it wasn't today. You're so smart. And do it from there. So smart. You are a         |
| 01:02:06   | clever programmer. So that's good. So you reset the token. You can also hook it. Yeah, yeah,             |
| 01:02:13   | basically just I just use the date, right? Because you probably aren't going to go to Disney twice       |
| 01:02:17   | in one day. Like logically speaking, like it could happen. I could see that there would definitely       |
| 01:02:23   | be an instance where it would happen, but it's unlikely. And if it happens, you know, and if             |
| 01:02:27   | that happens, then you can work around it, right? But as it is, you know, it would be really simple      |
| 01:02:32   | to just save a date in [[Data Jar]]. I like that idea. Save the date in [[Data Jar]]. And then just get the        |
| 01:02:41   | date. And if it's, if the date is today's date, then do that. Just make sure that you only do            |
| 01:02:46   | the date, not the date and time, because otherwise the date and time is never going to be the current    |
| 01:02:51   | date. But if you format it as just the date, then you should be good to go. So yeah, that that's         |
| 01:02:57   | probably how I do that. And then yeah, but also you could just attach it to disconnecting from           |
| 01:03:02   | CarPlay and just check your location. And if you're at Disney, then have it like throw up a prompt       |
| 01:03:08   | to go. Like actually what you could do with that is use a push cut action to send yourself a push        |
| 01:03:15   | cut notification to mark the car is parked. And then when you tap that, it runs the shortcut.            |
| 01:03:20   | Yeah, another option I was thinking was a focus mode, because use a location based focus mode,           |
| 01:03:25   | which I've already been doing, where when I arrive at the Disney park, it changes the home screen,       |
| 01:03:32   | it changes my notification preferences, does all that stuff. But the problem is it triggers the          |
| 01:03:37   | geo before you park, you know, as soon as you get in the in or near the structure, it's already          |
| 01:03:42   | triggered. So it's too early in the process. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's why I hook it into the magic    |
| 01:03:49   | bands when you get the magic bands. And also you can wear the magic bands to Disney, California,         |
| 01:03:52   | even if you can't use it, right? Yeah, you can. But they are actually in the process of adding them.     |
| 01:03:57   | So that's going to be, I think, pretty, pretty soon in the future. As we're recording this verb,         |
| 01:04:02   | I'm going to be going next weekend to D23, which is the big Disney kind of like version of Comic-Con.    |
| 01:04:08   | Daisy is working at it and she got me in. So I'm going to go in for one day and                          |
| 01:04:13   | I fully expect we're going to get a big announcement about magic bands at Disneyland.                    |
| 01:04:17   | So nice. So you're getting your Disneyland news here too, today.                                         |
| 01:04:21   | Perfect. Perfect. Well, the good news is, David, I'm also booking a plane ticket. I'm just going         |
| 01:04:25   | to come crash that now. Are you going to come over? Yeah. Well, I'm going to have to come visit and      |
| 01:04:30   | see Disney again, because I only got a day there last time, right? I probably need to make it at         |
| 01:04:35   | least two days next time. And I missed out on all the Star Wars stuff. So I've got to come back.         |
| 01:04:39   | You do. And my construction will be done soon and we're going to have a guest room. So I got a bed       |
| 01:04:45   | for you. Lovely. All right. Arranged. We mentioned shortcuts earlier. Shortcuts got love this year,      |
| 01:04:51   | not just in shortcuts, but also shortcuts actions, which is kind of meta, but it's good, right?          |
| 01:04:56   | Yeah. I mean, shortcuts already had shortcuts actions to be clear. It's just got more                    |
| 01:05:01   | shortcuts actions now. So you can delete shortcuts and you can also open shortcuts,                      |
| 01:05:08   | as well as running them. So you can go to an edit mode and I create shortcuts with                       |
| 01:05:15   | shortcut actions as well. And I feel like the delete and the open are really good when you               |
| 01:05:21   | combine it with the get shortcuts actions. So you can get shortcuts from, say, a specific folder,        |
| 01:05:28   | and then you can choose from list and then use the result of your choose from list to                    |
| 01:05:33   | open it or delete it as is appropriate. So that you can clean up your shortcuts library a little         |
| 01:05:39   | bit if, like me, you have a, oh my God, I don't know how many shortcuts. 1,337, David. I have a          |
| 01:05:44   | leaked number of shortcuts. This episode of the automators is brought to you by hover. Make a name       |

| 01:05:58   | one of Relay FM's longest running sponsors. When you have that one big idea, where do you go? Well,      |
| 01:06:04   | your business starts with a domain name. So for many entrepreneurs, hover is that big leap.              |
| 01:06:09   | For me, it was both MacSparky and Sparks Law started on hover. Hover has over 300 domain name           |
| 01:06:15   | extensions to choose from. So no matter what it is you want to build, there's a domain name waiting      |
| 01:06:20   | for it. And they have excellent technical support to answer any questions you may have. And they're      |
| 01:06:25   | dedicated to getting you online, not upselling you. Hover has a free who is privacy. So the bad guys     |
| 01:06:32   | don't get your information, a clean user interface, monthly sales on popular top level domains. And      |
| 01:06:38   | it's easy to see why hover is the popular choice for people starting businesses. Every time I get a      |
| 01:06:44   | new harebrained idea for something I want to do on the internet, I go to hover. And some of those        |
| 01:06:48   | ideas don't turn out to be harebrained. Some of them change my life like MacSparky.com and for           |
| 01:06:54   | a while, SparksLaw.com. I have nothing but good feelings when I go to hover because it's always          |
| 01:06:59   | the starting off place for something exciting in my life. Now we know you like intuitive user            |

| 01:07:19   | Years ago, I bought my kids their domains, and I did that through hover. And now as they're growing      |
| 01:07:23   | up, I'm getting ready to hand the keys over to them. So what else you buy your domain and start          |

| 01:07:46   | Relay-a-Thin. So David, do you read on your iPad because books got some new actions?                     |
| 01:07:52   | Yeah, although I have to admit I spend a lot more time in the Amazon app than the [[Apple Books]] app        |
| 01:07:57   | these days. But some of the new actions I think are really interesting. Like you can have it open        |
| 01:08:03   | a specific book or open a collection of books. So let's say you've got like kind of self-help books,     |
| 01:08:09   | you could have a shortcut that sets you up to read those books or some other kind of books.              |
| 01:08:15   | You can also change the point size. And I think this is another one where they got the                   |
| 01:08:21   | automation boon of the simplicity of adding actions. The books team has gone through and                 |
| 01:08:27   | done the same thing the Apple Notes team did. Yes. Yeah, I really feel like they did. The only           |
| 01:08:31   | thing I'm noting right now is I've just opened my phone to double-check what the actions were.           |
| 01:08:35   | And the Books app has disappeared. It did briefly have an open PDF in Books action,                      |
| 01:08:42   | and then the Books app just disappeared entirely. But I'm going to blame that on the fact that most      |
| 01:08:46   | of the other apps aren't appearing in shortcuts either right now. So I think I found a small             |
| 01:08:50   | glitch that will need to be fixed before iOS releases. But as it is, I'm really glad that the            |
| 01:08:56   | Books app has got some love there as well, because especially for people who use collections to          |
| 01:09:01   | organise their fiction from their nonfiction or work-related reading material from everything            |
| 01:09:08   | else, being able to just open a particular collection or similar whilst you're in your                   |
| 01:09:13   | work focus mode is really great. And something you just mentioned that I want to note is I have          |
| 01:09:18   | been a little concerned about shortcuts ability to find actions throughout this beta period,             |
| 01:09:24   | where you'll pull an app and actions that you know exist won't show up, or it just seems a little        |
| 01:09:32   | unusual in its ability to find actions. Yeah, so I think that this is an unfortunate reaction to,        |
| 01:09:40   | let's say, the fact that they're adding aliases to Shortcuts actions. So do you remember when            |
| 01:09:47   | Exit Shortcut got renamed to Stop Shortcut? Yeah. That was a change that happened, I think,              |
| 01:09:52   | in iOS 14. I still type Exit to this day when I'm looking for that action. And guess what I can't        |
| 01:09:59   | find? Yeah. The Stop Shortcut action, because it just wouldn't show up. But now what they've done is     |
| 01:10:04   | they've added support for basically aliases or secondary names for actions so that you can               |
| 01:10:11   | find them more easily. And I believe that, unfortunately, the fact that you sometimes                    |
| 01:10:16   | couldn't find an action is a bug related to the fact that they've been adding more ways to find          |
| 01:10:23   | the actions. So hopefully, that's all been fixed. I've not been having that problem recently myself.     |
| 01:10:30   | So hopefully, that's not happening anymore for you either. But that was definitely something             |
| 01:10:34   | that came up in one of the early betas. And also, I'd search for something and start scrolling down      |
| 01:10:39   | and realise it hadn't done the search. So I'd have to scroll back up and tap into the search bar,        |
| 01:10:43   | and then it would run the search. And that's all gone away now. So that went away for me a while         |
| 01:10:48   | ago. I haven't had that. But sometimes the actions I find, maybe I'm just not as fluent with them as     |
| 01:10:55   | you are. But sometimes I'm like, well, wait a second, then I will find it. Sometimes just doing          |
| 01:10:59   | a scroll or a different search coming out from a different angle. But maybe it's just me. But that's     |
| 01:11:05   | something to keep an eye out. Yeah, I found like, if I search for an action, and then I tap into an      |
| 01:11:12   | app, then my search remains active. And the thing that catches me every time is then I clear the         |
| 01:11:18   | search and it also clears my app filter. And it's like, actually, no, I wanted to clear the search       |
| 01:11:22   | and stay in the app filter. Like, I've now found the app that I'm looking for. Like, I just want         |
| 01:11:26   | to have an unfiltered list of actions from that app. So maybe I should file that as feedback,            |
| 01:11:32   | actually, because that's not the expected behaviour for me. And, you know, it probably                    |
| 01:11:37   | is for everybody else, but it certainly isn't for me. There's also kind of a group of new,               |
| 01:11:41   | like systems actions, which are all pretty notable. I think we should let's just go through those.       |
| 01:11:47   | The first one is set personal hotspot. You know, now that wasn't there before, but now let's say         |
| 01:11:52   | you want to have an airport mode or something, you can have it turn on your personal hotspot             |
| 01:11:58   | for you. And then when you leave it, you can have it turn it off. And I think that's a real handy        |
| 01:12:02   | little action. Yeah, yeah, I think that is, you know, really useful. Like I have, I've actually          |
| 01:12:08   | configured this so that when I connect to the Bluetooth in my dad's car, it pops up and it               |
| 01:12:13   | asks me if I want to turn on the hotspot. So the, you know, I can turn on the hotspot on my phone        |
| 01:12:19   | and then when I disconnect it, it pops up and asks me if I want to disable the hotspot. And of course,   |
| 01:12:25   | because it's Bluetooth, you know, that can't run entirely automatically, but I also don't want it        |
| 01:12:29   | to run automatically. So yeah, it's just really nice to be able to, to, you know, turn that on           |
| 01:12:35   | and off. But they've also taken those really cool image actions where you can like pick up a picture     |
| 01:12:40   | of your dog and drop it into messages like a sticker. And they've made that into a shortcut              |
| 01:12:45   | section along with extracting text from images as a shortcut section. So you can remove the image        |
| 01:12:50   | background and you can get the text from an image inside of a shortcut section, which is just so         |
| 01:12:55   | cool. And that is one of the ones that I've actually given to my mom and my dad, because they do take    |
| 01:13:02   | pictures of text and then they want to be able to copy something. And they kind of, you know, it can     |
| 01:13:06   | be a bit tricky in photos. Like if you enter the wrong edit mode or you change what you're looking       |
| 01:13:11   | at in the edit mode, then you lose the ability to select text. And that happens quite frequently         |
| 01:13:17   | when they're trying to do things. So I'm really glad that you can now just extract this with,            |
| 01:13:23   | you know, with a shortcut section. So they now have fancy new home screen apps, which don't,             |
| 01:13:28   | they're just shortcuts, but hey, it works for them. Yeah. And just unrelated, once you get               |
| 01:13:34   | iOS 16 installed, if you want to impress anyone in your life, go to them, take a picture of their        |
| 01:13:40   | kid or their dog or whatever, and then just immediately drag it out of the image and let                 |
| 01:13:45   | them watch you do it and put it into a message and send it to them. And it's a background                |
| 01:13:49   | removed image with a simple drag. I mean, I guess we should not be as impressed by this as we are        |
| 01:13:56   | because this has been a technology has been evolving for a long time. First, it was like a               |
| 01:13:59   | $600 Photoshop feature. Then it eventually became a free preview feature with a little manipulation.     |
| 01:14:06   | And now it's just literally drag it out. And it works really well. And I think this is going to          |
| 01:14:13   | be the one that all the non-nerd types are really excited about because it's just so fun. And            |
| 01:14:21   | did you use that much in the beta? I mean, I was really impressed with it the first couple               |
| 01:14:25   | weeks, but to be honest with you, I don't really use it very much. So it's one of those things that      |
| 01:14:30   | I go through using in sort of fits and spurts. So I was in IKEA a couple of weeks ago and taking         |
| 01:14:36   | pictures of something that my mom had asked me to look for for her. They were looking at footstools.     |
| 01:14:43   | But IKEA is kind of cramped at times. And there's like all the things ever and all the people.           |
| 01:14:48   | And it was really difficult to get a shot of just the footstool that I was trying to show them.          |
| 01:14:54   | And so I actually used that feature then because I was able to just pick up the footstool and drop       |
| 01:14:59   | it into messages. And so we didn't have the, yeah, yeah, I really like that one. Okay, there's six       |
| 01:15:04   | in the picture, mom. I need you to tell me which one you really like so that I can actually measure      |
| 01:15:08   | it for you. Of course, IKEA have got all this stuff on their website, but this is my mother. She         |
| 01:15:12   | wasn't actually in the mood for browsing the website, even though I sent her the links.                  |
| 01:15:16   | So yeah, it was really useful for that. So I'm looking forward to being able to use this and             |
| 01:15:21   | having other people use it when they send things to me. It can be very difficult. Sometimes somebody     |
| 01:15:25   | takes a picture and sends it to you and goes, Hey, isn't this awesome? And there's three things in       |
| 01:15:29   | the picture and you don't know which one it is. So maybe they'll use that instead.                       |
| 01:15:34   | Yeah, I was trying to experiment as we sat here to send you a picture that my dog is asleep in           |
| 01:15:39   | her bed, which kind of matches her fur. And so I did it. This is really disturbing. In fact,             |
| 01:15:48   | I don't think we should put this in the show. It cut her head off. It's just her body without her        |
| 01:15:53   | head. Oh, well, the good news is, David, is I got a lovely little picture of her sleeping                |
| 01:15:57   | in her little doggy bed on the floor. So, you know, that's, that's, I would say an improvement           |
| 01:16:03   | over something going missing. Yeah, it's like, because she has a collar on and just decided,             |
| 01:16:08   | okay, that's the top. And this is, this is not, I'm not sharing this with the audience.                  |
| 01:16:13   | Yeah, no, I think the thing that to me is a little perhaps sad is the fact that, you know,               |
| 01:16:21   | if I tap on the photos, like built in app in, in the messages app, I can't do it from there.             |
| 01:16:31   | But the good news is, is I got a playdate, David, you know, the panic playdate, the little cube          |
| 01:16:36   | gaming thing with the black and white display. Love it as a side note. But I took a picture              |
| 01:16:42   | of the box when it arrived and the little, the box for the case as well that it came in.                 |
| 01:16:47   | And I was able to just pick that, that picture up. And it was on the bubble wrap and the brown           |
| 01:16:54   | paper behind it. And the brown paper kind of blends in with the yellow box. It did a really              |
| 01:16:57   | great job. It did a really great job picking up the playdate in that picture.                            |
| 01:17:02   | Yeah, no, it's impressive. And I do encourage you to play with this and share it with some of            |
| 01:17:08   | your friends because it is really a nice feature. And now it's shortcut automation. So you can just      |
| 01:17:13   | do it. Yeah, we got the ability to optimise the size of a PDF. I feel like that's kind of the            |
| 01:17:20   | boon from the stuff they're doing over on the Mac. Yes, yeah, that that's definitely a case of, hey,     |
| 01:17:26   | there's a great ultimate direction for this. And we can implement it on iOS too. Let's do this.          |
| 01:17:31   | Same thing, because the Mac app got the clock app now. And this is stuff that we'll talk about           |
| 01:17:36   | once they ship a Ventura. But you couldn't set timers and shortcuts on the Mac because there             |
| 01:17:41   | was no clock app. And I'm convinced the only reason we have a clock app on the Mac now is for            |
| 01:17:45   | shortcuts. But you wanted the ability to choose between tabs on the Mac and they brought that over       |
| 01:17:50   | to the iPhone. That's kind of cool. Yeah, they did. And yeah, they've also just given us better          |
| 01:18:00   | integration by having things in all the places. The thing that for me is still not in all the            |
| 01:18:03   | places, which I'm missing, is the ability to use the sleep focus mode as a trigger on anything           |
| 01:18:09   | that's not an iPhone. Yeah, like it's just not a trigger on iPad OS. And I really wish it was,           |
| 01:18:15   | because I know that it doesn't have the health kid integration, though I personally don't see            |
| 01:18:19   | a good reason why the health app isn't on my iPad. Imagine looking at your ECG there.                    |
| 01:18:24   | But it would be really nice if I could use the sleep focus mode as a trigger, because that is            |
| 01:18:28   | my end of day. Like when my sleep focus mode engages, that means that my day is over and I               |
| 01:18:33   | want to reset things back to their usual state with the rotation lock and the way it should be.          |
| 01:18:39   | And also, I would like my iPad sound volume to be set back to the default state. And I                   |
| 01:18:45   | have to kind of work around it at the moment. And I don't love doing what I'm doing there.               |
| 01:18:50   | So yeah, it's not great. What I'm doing, David, is the Disney shortcut where I mentioned saving          |
| 01:18:56   | the date in [[Data Jar]]. Yeah. Yeah, I saved the date and the hour in [[Data Jar]]. And then I trigger a        |
| 01:19:06   | different focus mode. And then I trigger, and then from the other focus mode, that's what triggers       |
| 01:19:12   | everything on my iPads. And then I trigger the sleep mode again. So it's not great. And when it          |
| 01:19:19   | triggers the sleep mode, it checks whether or not the current date and hour is in [[Data Jar]]. If I         |
| 01:19:24   | trigger it like 11, 59, 58 seconds, then it might happen twice. But yeah, I can live with that.          |
| 01:19:32   | I think at some point we have to do a show on ways, Rose hacks [[Data Jar]],                               |
| 01:19:37   | to add features because you have a whole collection of them.                                             |
| 01:19:41   | I love [[Data Jar]]. Honestly, it's really great. I have periodic things that trigger on various             |
| 01:19:47   | devices, which will do things like create a daily note and agenda for my work stuff.                     |
| 01:19:52   | But because the precise time trigger and so on isn't necessarily perfect, I actually just store          |
| 01:20:00   | the date and the ID of the note in [[Data Jar]] so that I know that I've created a note for this date.       |
| 01:20:08   | And then I can open today's note with just one click or one tap from anywhere and go straight            |
| 01:20:13   | to it. And I love the fact that I can do that and I wouldn't be able to do it without [[Data Jar]].          |
| 01:20:17   | So yeah, we should do another show on [[Data Jar]]. Maybe we should get [[Simon Støvring\|Simon]] back again and ask him         |
| 01:20:21   | what he's excited about and shortcuts and all the things he's been up to.                                |
| 01:20:25   | That's a good idea. One last thing. I really think the story here, we talked about it in                 |
| 01:20:30   | the first segment. But the story here is that we've got more chickens and eggs. And it's been fun        |
| 01:20:37   | today talking through the new actions we got. And historically, that's kind of the end of it.            |
| 01:20:42   | We get to the release of the operating system and then we were kind of settled for a year.               |
| 01:20:47   | And some apps will show up on the scene like [[Drafts]] and really take advantage of it. But                 |
| 01:20:52   | in general, the growth rate of new actions has been revolving around September every year when           |
| 01:20:59   | Apple releases the new update. And I feel like that is changing this year. And I think that's the        |
| 01:21:05   | thing that's going to be fun for us as automators as we make shows throughout the rest of the year.      |
| 01:21:09   | I think we're going to have a lot of apps that show up that suddenly have way more shortcut              |
| 01:21:14   | support, which gives you more toys to play with, which allows you to easily make better                  |
| 01:21:19   | shortcuts and automation. And this is great. I mean, you see it happening on the Mac,                    |
| 01:21:25   | but it's happening on the iPhone and the iPad too. And I think that's going to be the big                |
| 01:21:31   | story of the next year for this show that we are going to find increasingly more powerful,               |
| 01:21:36   | yet easy to create automations because of what they've done in the back. And I hope that you             |
| 01:21:41   | take that away from the show and you bring a sense of curiosity to shortcuts because I think             |
| 01:21:46   | every time you open it up, you may find some new actions in there.                                       |
| 01:21:49   | Yeah, exactly. And honestly, it's just so great to see all the developers inside and outside of          |
| 01:21:56   | Apple going, yeah, shortcuts is shortcuts for everyone. They renamed my shortcuts to shortcuts,          |
| 01:22:03   | but I feel like they're also taking shortcuts from just a nerd tool to, hey,                             |
| 01:22:08   | shortcuts is giving us some great idea. This is what people have been doing with it and Apple            |
| 01:22:14   | have taken some of that and implemented it straight into the operating system, which I'm                 |
| 01:22:18   | excited about to be clear. You can still do this stuff through shortcuts, setting your wallpaper,        |
| 01:22:22   | setting your watch face. But you can now do it really easily integrated into a focus mode.               |
| 01:22:28   | And I think for a lot of people, they just need to find out that if they go to the top of the            |
| 01:22:36   | hill, then they get to see the thumb fare and the circus at the bottom. And they can do everything       |
| 01:22:40   | from sit on the merry-go-round to go on the roller coasters. But if they don't know the circus is        |
| 01:22:44   | there, then they're never going to come join it. All right. Well, on that, we're going to wrap up        |
