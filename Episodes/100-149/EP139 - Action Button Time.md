| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automatorss, the Automation Podcast, where we talk about grabbing your        |
| 00:06      | tech and making it do your bidding just like you wish cats would, and of course, your tech.         |
| 00:11      | I am Rosemary Richard and joined as always by David Sparks.                                         |
| 00:14      | Hey, David, how are you?                                                                            |
| 00:15      | David Sparks Good, but you sent my mind down a little                                               |
| 00:18      | rabbit hole.                                                                                        |
| 00:19      | It's like, what is more responsive, home kit or a cat?                                              |
| 00:23      | I mean, an average cat.                                                                             |
| 00:25      | Rosemary Richard Average cats are pretty responsive.                                                |
| 00:27      | It's just that they don't necessarily respond in the way that is intended, whereas home             |
| 00:32      | kits.                                                                                               |
| 00:33      | David Sparks Well, home kit sometimes just seems to                                                 |
| 00:36      | not do things.                                                                                      |
| 00:37      | I was helping somebody actually an iOS Today listener last week on the show or just after             |
| 00:42      | the show.                                                                                           |
| 00:43      | They are having issues where they are husband, so they have presence automations in home            |
| 00:48      | kit.                                                                                                |
| 00:49      | So when the first person arrives, when the last person leaves, and so on.                           |
| 00:54      | And those weren't working for their husband.                                                        |
| 00:56      | Rosemary Richard Only for their husband.                                                            |
| 00:58      | David Sparks Maybe he's just a non-person.                                                          |
| 01:00      | Rosemary Richard Yeah, maybe he's just a non-person.                                                |
| 01:01      | David Sparks Well, that's just it.                                                                  |
| 01:02      | So they went through all the settings.                                                              |
| 01:03      | They compared everything absolutely identical from person to person, phone to phone.                |
| 01:08      | And they changed.                                                                                   |
| 01:09      | So the way that they debug this, which, you know, as well, there's weird things because             |
| 01:14      | it's presence, right?                                                                               |
| 01:15      | So you actually have to leave home to change it.                                                    |
| 01:19      | So they changed it to anyone leaves home and anyone arrives home.                                   |
| 01:25      | And then they went off on a little errand, and then they came back and they sent their              |
| 01:27      | husband off on a little errand.                                                                     |
| 01:29      | And for them, the automation worked both times, for their husband it did not.                       |
| 01:34      | And that's how they were like, okay, so there's something wrong with that side of things,           |
| 01:38      | not my side of things.                                                                              |
| 01:40      | Like he's simultaneously always at home and never at home.                                          |
| 01:43      | David Sparks That's based on the phone, right?                                                      |
| 01:45      | It's detecting the presence by your phone.                                                          |
| 01:47      | Maybe did he have like a really old phone or something?                                             |
| 01:49      | Rosemary Richard Nope, no, brand new iPhone 15 Pro.                                                 |
| 01:52      | And this is the crazy thing.                                                                        |
| 01:54      | Because it was working with the 14, or at least they thought it was, you know, it's difficult       |
| 02:00      | to go back and check when you've traded that your device in.                                        |
| 02:03      | But you know, as far as they were aware, I've been working with the 14s.                            |
| 02:07      | And then they both got 15s and her continued to work for him.                                       |
| 02:10      | Not so much.                                                                                        |
| 02:11      | And it's just, you know, kind of crazy.                                                             |
| 02:14      | So I would vote that cats are more responsive than [[HomeKit]] when the cat wants to be responsive.     |
| 02:21      | [[HomeKit]] will always give you a response, but that may not be what you want.                         |
| 02:27      | David Sparks But like a cat, it may not give you much                                               |
| 02:29      | feedback either.                                                                                    |
| 02:31      | That's the problem, right?                                                                          |
| 02:32      | Rosemary Richard This is true.                                                                      |
| 02:33      | This is true.                                                                                       |
| 02:34      | Sometimes it'll just just go, mm-hmm.                                                               |
| 02:35      | And then, and it's that positive mm-hmm that the HomePod or Siri does.                              |
| 02:40      | And you're like, okay, cool.                                                                        |
| 02:42      | But the light that I just asked you to turn on isn't on.                                            |
| 02:46      | And I don't know what you just think you did.                                                       |
| 02:49      | David Sparks Well, if you're tuning in for the first                                                |
| 02:52      | time and you're still here, we are the Automators.                                                  |
| 02:54      | We like to talk about automation in different ways you can use it in your life.                     |
| 02:58      | And today we've got a very exciting topic because Apple released the new iPhone 15 Pro              |
| 03:03      | since the last time we recorded.                                                                    |
| 03:06      | And both Rose and I have been having a lot of fun with the action button.                           |
| 03:10      | So Apple added a button to the phone that they call the action button.                              |
| 03:15      | And by default, it's a silencer button, you know, just like the old ring silence physical           |
| 03:21      | button used to have.                                                                                |
| 03:22      | Now it's a programmable button.                                                                     |
| 03:25      | And Apple's got a bunch of options with it, like a lot of people have immediately reprogrammed      |
| 03:30      | it.                                                                                                 |
| 03:31      | So it's their camera button.                                                                        |
| 03:32      | So if you push it, it gets you to your camera and you can take a picture really quick.              |
| 03:37      | And there's other things you can do with it, like you can have it record a voice memo.              |
| 03:41      | And there's a bunch of built-in features.                                                           |
| 03:43      | But what Rose and I were both super interested in is you can make it run a shortcut.                |
| 03:48      | And I love it when Apple ties shortcuts to things, because then if you're an automator,             |
| 03:54      | you can make that button do way more than the default single functions.                             |
| 04:00      | And we've been talking about it.                                                                    |
| 04:01      | We both got new iPhones and we've we've both got thoughts and ideas and tips for getting            |
| 04:08      | the most out of the action, but we wanted to talk about that today.                                 |
| 04:11      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 04:12      | And it's just one of those things where to start with, you're like, oh, my God, I could             |
| 04:16      | do so many things with this.                                                                        |
| 04:17      | And you start coming up with this weird, a complicated set of scenarios.                            |
| 04:23      | If I'm at home and it's after sunset, it's before bedtime, then when I press the action             |
| 04:26      | button, it should do this.                                                                          |
| 04:27      | And you start building this giant flowchart.                                                        |
| 04:31      | And it seems like a really good idea.                                                               |
| 04:34      | And then you realise that you haven't actually done anything with this at all.                      |
| 04:39      | And you probably should.                                                                            |
| 04:41      | So yeah, I started with really simple.                                                              |
| 04:44      | I changed my action button to a shortcut and add a single action to that shortcut, toggle           |
| 04:49      | silent mode.                                                                                        |
| 04:50      | So I was like, this way I'm running a shortcut.                                                     |
| 04:52      | So you know, if I want to go change things, I can go change things and I can change them            |
| 04:55      | on any device and figure it out from there.                                                         |
| 04:57      | But then, you know, I've got the action button doing something.                                     |
| 05:01      | And then from there, I started branching out a little bit because I was like, you know,             |
| 05:06      | what, what, what do I want from, from my action button?                                             |
| 05:09      | You know, sometimes I do want to toggle silent.                                                     |
| 05:11      | Sometimes I do want to, you know, choose a focus mode.                                              |
| 05:14      | But it kind of depends on context, you know, time of day definitely can come into it.               |
| 05:20      | You know, if I am at home, having the option to trigger some home automations, definitely           |
| 05:25      | useful when I'm not at home.                                                                        |
| 05:27      | Not so much.                                                                                        |
| 05:28      | Don't want to add those in there.                                                                   |
| 05:31      | And so on.                                                                                          |
| 05:32      | And so, you know, I had to figure out, you know, what things do I really want to access             |
| 05:36      | the most?                                                                                           |
| 05:37      | One of the other things I made a point of doing is reviewing my use of control centre               |
| 05:41      | because I use control centre quite a bit, unsurprisingly.                                           |
| 05:46      | And you know, especially when, when she customised it and added, you know, your own, the actions    |
| 05:51      | that you want, where you want them.                                                                 |
| 05:54      | And so I had a look in there and went, huh, okay, so based on, you know, what I, what               |
| 05:59      | I'm looking at here, I should probably add some of these as options.                                |
| 06:03      | So I have choosing a focus mode.                                                                    |
| 06:05      | I've got toggling silent and rotation lock and the Apple TV remote is in there as well              |
| 06:13      | because that's pretty useful as a scanning a QR code.                                               |
| 06:16      | And then I've also added some other options for like playing music where it'll pick, you            |
| 06:21      | know, like a particular playlist and play it, but it picks a different playlist contextually        |
| 06:26      | depending on like time of day, focus mode, stuff like that.                                         |
| 06:29      | So I've really gone down a rabbit hole here, David.                                                 |
| 06:31      | I don't know if one episode is going to be enough to talk about all of this, to be honest.          |
| 06:35      | Well, I do want to break it down because I think for folks following along at home,                 |
| 06:40      | we need to, we need to explain how we're doing these tricks.                                        |
| 06:42      | But the first question to be answered and it's the thing you asked is what is the context           |
| 06:48      | of the action button because, you know, because you've got this action button here and by           |
| 06:53      | default it works all the time and does the same thing.                                              |
| 06:56      | Like if you set it to toggle ring silence, it does that.                                            |
| 07:00      | If you set it to open the camera, it does that.                                                     |
| 07:03      | Every time you press the button, it doesn't matter if you're in bed or out and about,               |
| 07:09      | it's going to do the same thing.                                                                    |
| 07:10      | And so what I'd like you to think about when you're programming your action button is context.      |
| 07:17      | What are the contexts that I want to detect and act upon, like for example, I'm using               |
| 07:24      | multiple contexts with my action button and it sounds like roses too.                               |
| 07:29      | For me, the first one would be, you know, is the phone face down or not?                            |
| 07:34      | That's a context.                                                                                   |
| 07:35      | It's face down.                                                                                     |
| 07:36      | That means something to me.                                                                         |
| 07:37      | Like I'm not going to be able to see the screen.                                                    |
| 07:39      | So maybe there's something I do with the action button when it's face down that, that I don't       |
| 07:43      | do when it's face up.                                                                               |
| 07:45      | Another basis of context for me is focus modes.                                                     |
| 07:48      | Like focus modes are very easy to set and I'm a big fan of them.                                    |
| 07:52      | So I'm constantly working in different focus modes.                                                 |
| 07:55      | Right now I'm in my podcasting focus mode, which means most people in the world can't               |
| 07:59      | get a hold of me right now and I'm not going to get a bunch of interruptions.                       |
| 08:03      | But I can have my phone, when I trigger the action button, check to see what focus mode             |
| 08:09      | I'm in.                                                                                             |
| 08:10      | And then, you know, that could lead to different actions as well.                                   |
| 08:13      | Rose was talking about time of day as a context.                                                    |
| 08:17      | So you could have it check for time of day and we're going to break all these down, but             |
| 08:22      | I just kind of want to go over what they are first.                                                 |
| 08:25      | Another one that Rose shared was location.                                                          |
| 08:28      | Like if you're at a specific location, that's a context as well.                                    |
| 08:32      | And so I think what you should think about as you're getting started on your action button          |
| 08:37      | journey is what are the contexts of your life that would make most sense to allow you to            |
| 08:43      | change what the action button does?                                                                 |
| 08:46      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 08:47      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 08:48      | I mean, there are so many things that you can do with this as well.                                 |
| 08:50      | So, you know, obviously you can check your location, you know, it could be a very simple            |
| 08:54      | binary, am I at home, am I not at home?                                                             |
| 08:57      | Or it could be a more complex, am I at home, am I at work, am I, you know, at this sort             |
| 09:03      | of general area, otherwise known as Disney, you know, and so on.                                    |
| 09:08      | But you could also have, do I have a calendar event within the next hour as a context?              |
| 09:15      | Because sometimes, you know, some folks live lives by their calendar.                               |
| 09:19      | Everything is in their calendar, and, you know, if they're not checking their calendar,             |
| 09:23      | things are going to, you know, disappear and, you know, vanish into a very strange place.           |
| 09:29      | And other folks like me tend not to have all that many things in their calendar, so it's            |
| 09:33      | quite useful when I, you know, push my action button to consider, hey, you know, there's            |
| 09:37      | a calendar event coming up that's in my calendar that I should probably be reminded about this      |
| 09:42      | so that I actually know what's going on.                                                            |
| 09:45      | And you know, it can maybe, you know, prompt me to prepare for it and so on.                        |
| 09:49      | There's also other things like, you know, am I roaming?                                             |
| 09:51      | You know, if you're roaming with data, that could be very useful.                                   |
| 09:56      | If your phone is in silent mode or isn't in silent mode, that could be very useful to               |
| 10:01      | use as well.                                                                                        |
| 10:03      | And all sorts of things.                                                                            |
| 10:04      | Yeah, another good one is which Wi-Fi am I connected to?                                            |
| 10:08      | Like, if you wanted to do a simple context shift, you could say, well, if I'm on the                |
| 10:14      | work Wi-Fi, make the action button do X, and if I'm on the home Wi-Fi, make the action              |
| 10:21      | button do Y.                                                                                        |
| 10:22      | And then you can go beyond that, you can say, well, make the action button, give me a list          |
| 10:26      | of things I can do.                                                                                 |
| 10:27      | And we're going to get through all that.                                                            |
| 10:29      | But what I wanted to start with was just this idea of understand that you have the power            |
| 10:35      | of making it contextually aware.                                                                    |
| 10:38      | And that's a step above what you normally do, right?                                                |
| 10:41      | I mean, like Rose said, when she first got her phone, she just turned it on where if                |
| 10:45      | you hold it down with a shortcut, it toggles silent mode.                                           |
| 10:49      | She could have if she wanted, and you could too, and this could be where you ultimately             |
| 10:54      | land.                                                                                               |
| 10:55      | You could have, there's a feature in shortcuts called choose from menu.                             |
| 10:59      | And it's the easiest way to create a quick menu of things you can choose from.                      |
| 11:04      | And so you could make a choose from menu with five options and say, anytime I hold the action       |
| 11:08      | button down, let me pick.                                                                           |
| 11:12      | One would be to toggle silence.                                                                     |
| 11:15      | Another one would be to open the camera.                                                            |
| 11:16      | The other one would be to do a voice memo, you hear what I'm doing all the stuff that               |
| 11:21      | you can already do with it, but I'm letting you pick every time you open the menu.                  |
| 11:26      | But you could also add your own shortcuts too.                                                      |
| 11:28      | And maybe the fourth one is text my location to my wife, right?                                     |
| 11:31      | And so you could make a shortcut that is triggered by the action button that is not respecting.     |
| 11:37      | There's no context to it at all.                                                                    |
| 11:39      | If you hold down the action button, it runs the choose from menu script and lets you pick           |
| 11:44      | one.                                                                                                |
| 11:45      | And that's a very easy way to get more than one thing out of the action menu button.                |
| 11:50      | Now the downside is you still got to pick, right?                                                   |
| 11:52      | I mean, with the default action button, it just happens.                                            |
| 11:55      | If I hold down the button, the camera turns on or the silence gets toggled, but I don't             |
| 12:00      | get options to do other things.                                                                     |
| 12:02      | But with this, you get options to do other things, but you've got one more tap.                     |
| 12:05      | You've got to pick which one you want to do, and that's kind of the nature of the beast.            |
| 12:09      | But that is a perfectly acceptable, automated way to handle the action button and say, well,        |
| 12:17      | you know what?                                                                                      |
| 12:18      | I don't want to get too fancy with this.                                                            |
| 12:19      | I don't want to think about locations, but I would like to have the option to do more               |
| 12:23      | than one thing.                                                                                     |
| 12:24      | In that case, I would recommend just create a new shortcut called action button.                    |
| 12:29      | I call it my super action button shortcut because it makes me happy to say it's super.              |
| 12:34      | And just say choose your menu and then put all the stuff in there that you want.                    |
| 12:39      | Like maybe, you know, you can use all the default stuff if you want, but you can also               |
| 12:43      | make your own custom ones.                                                                          |
| 12:45      | And we talk about this on all the time on the show, but no matter what it is you want               |
| 12:49      | to do on an iPhone, it pretty much can do it with a shortcut.                                       |
| 12:52      | I mean, most things are available to, you know, you can make one turn on your lights.               |
| 12:56      | We were joking earlier about [[HomeKit]], but you could say, you know, make one of them                 |
| 12:59      | turn on the lights at home or turn off the lights or unlock the front door or whatever.             |
| 13:05      | And you can tie all of that to the action button with the simple choose from menu.                  |
| 13:09      | It doesn't have to just be five.                                                                    |
| 13:10      | It could be 10 or 20 and then you could scroll through a long list, but don't put anything          |
| 13:15      | more than you absolutely want in there because the more you put in there, the easier it is          |
| 13:18      | to hit the wrong one or, you know, take longer to find the one you need.                            |
| 13:23      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 13:24      | One of the things I definitely recommend for things like this is consider carefully before          |
| 13:29      | adding things to the menu, but to any kind of menu.                                                 |
| 13:32      | And I'm going to talk about a little trick that I've got for nicer menus in a bit.                  |
| 13:37      | Consider before you add things to a menu and also think, where are my hands going to be             |
| 13:43      | in relation to this menu?                                                                           |
| 13:45      | Now the action button is pretty high up on the left hand side of your phone, but I'm                |
| 13:49      | sure most folks or a large number of folks will be like myself where they're pressing               |
| 13:55      | it with, say, their second finger of their hand.                                                    |
| 13:59      | And so, you know, as you press and hold that, where is your thumb?                                  |
| 14:05      | Because that's what most people will end up tapping the screen with, you know, you're               |
| 14:07      | sort of pressing around the back of your phone.                                                     |
| 14:09      | And then where is my thumb?                                                                         |
| 14:10      | Is my thumb pretty high up or pretty low down when I do this?                                       |
| 14:14      | Because if your thumb's going to be pretty low down, what you're going to want to do                |
| 14:17      | is put the options that you want the most at the bottom of the menu.                                |
| 14:21      | If your thumb's going to be pretty high up, put the ones that you want most at the top              |
| 14:24      | of the menu.                                                                                        |
| 14:25      | And things like that, you know, it sounds very obvious, as I'm saying it, I'm sure.                 |
| 14:31      | I'm guessing a whole bunch of people are there rolling their eyes going, yeah, put it where         |
| 14:35      | you can touch it, obviously.                                                                        |
| 14:37      | But if you put 17 things in a menu and you have to scroll off the bottom of the screen              |
| 14:43      | to get to the three that you use the most, you're not going to be enjoying your use of              |
| 14:47      | the action button anywhere near as much as the person who dads two things there and their           |
| 14:50      | thumbs pretty much always in the right place anyway.                                                |
| 14:53      | So do you have a little bit of a think about that?                                                  |
| 14:56      | And also, if you're adding 17 actions to it, you know, definitely, we've talked about this          |
| 15:00      | a little bit before, use some kind of login to figure out how often you're actually using           |
| 15:05      | each of those options.                                                                              |
| 15:06      | Because it's so tempting to just like fill the home screen of a 12.9 inch iPad Pro with             |
| 15:11      | shortcuts that are all colour coded perfectly to match your exact needs.                             |
| 15:15      | But if you don't ever end up using any of them, that's not a good use of your device.               |
| 15:20      | So yeah, consider what you're going to add to any of these menus or actions before you              |
| 15:26      | do it, because it's definitely going to save you a little bit of, I don't, crankiness is            |
| 15:34      | the wrong word, but, you know, just generally, you know, yeah, it doesn't feel like it's            |
| 15:40      | smooth when these things don't work or don't quite work the way you were expecting.                 |
| 15:43      | And obviously, while you're in the build and test phase, you know, things, things aren't            |
| 15:48      | going to be perfect, but one of my, my rules for anything like this where it's like, it's           |
| 15:53      | like pre-baked onto the hardware and it's directly connected to something like that                 |
| 15:57      | is if I have to drop this and walk away from it right now, it should still be usable and            |
| 16:02      | work in some way.                                                                                   |
| 16:06      | And so, you know, I, you know, that might involve just throwing in a stop shortcut action before    |
| 16:09      | you get to the really complicated bit of logic that you haven't quite figured out yet, you          |
| 16:13      | know, if you have to drop it or something.                                                          |
| 16:14      | But yeah, definitely think about, you know, you at three o'clock in the morning when you've         |
| 16:19      | just been woken up because, you know, there's siren going off outside or something like             |
| 16:23      | that.                                                                                               |
| 16:24      | And you, you press this and can, can you comprehend what's going on when you press this?            |
| 16:31      | And yeah, that's, that's, that's my, my test at any rate.                                           |
| 16:34      | And on that note, in the choose from menu shortcut action, there is an option to sort.              |
| 16:40      | You can go in and edit that and there's the little hamburgers, the little three horizontal          |
| 16:45      | lines.                                                                                              |
| 16:46      | Three horizontal lines.                                                                             |
| 16:47      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 16:48      | I always mix horizontal and vertical for some reason I have trouble tracking that, but three        |
| 16:52      | horizontal lines, you just drag them up and down.                                                   |
| 16:54      | So you can like, if there's one you want towards the bottom or the top, you can drag it.            |
| 16:57      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 16:58      | But that's the, that's the level one, automated version of the action button shortcut, but          |
| 17:04      | I was teasing you about context earlier.                                                            |
| 17:07      | So you can make a shortcut based on context and you can do it on a single context or multiple       |
| 17:13      | context.                                                                                            |
| 17:14      | So we're, we're going to work our way up to multiple contexts, but first let's talk about           |
| 17:18      | a single context and whether it is location or focus mode or, you know, whatever you choose         |
| 17:26      | to, it chooses the, the variable upon which you're choosing your buttons, I would, I would          |
| 17:34      | do this with an if statement.                                                                       |
| 17:36      | So like, for instance, in mine, I just shared mine with you, Rose, we'll put it in a link           |
| 17:40      | to our action buttons in the, in the notes for the show.                                            |
| 17:44      | But I would, um, like just say, uh, you know, first I would call an example I'm using of            |
| 17:51      | focus modes.                                                                                        |
| 17:52      | I would say, you know, get current focus mode.                                                      |
| 17:55      | That's an action in shortcuts.                                                                      |
| 17:56      | So it gets the current focus mode.                                                                  |
| 17:58      | And then I would have an if statement that says, if, you know, focus mode equals work               |
| 18:03      | then, you know, then I can put in what it's going to do and then they'll have a separate            |
| 18:08      | one that says, if focus mode equals personal, I'll have what it's going to do.                      |
| 18:11      | And so all I do is I have a series of singular if statements underneath that, you know, get         |
| 18:18      | action mode and then I can start programming custom actions.                                        |
| 18:23      | Is that the best way to do it?                                                                      |
| 18:24      | I was thinking Rosemary may have a more clever way to do it, but that's the way I did it.           |
| 18:28      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 18:29      | I mean, I would do that.                                                                            |
| 18:30      | And one of the things that I would definitely recommend for folks, um, when they're doing           |
| 18:34      | a series of if statements like, okay, if focus mode is driving, so get current focus mode           |
| 18:38      | and then, um, you can tap on, uh, you can add an if statement and then you tap on the               |
| 18:42      | focus mode because think of the focus mode.                                                         |
| 18:44      | It's like a book.                                                                                   |
| 18:45      | Okay.                                                                                               |
| 18:46      | You want the title of the book, not the book itself because the, you know, the book is              |
| 18:48      | a concept and shortcuts doesn't necessarily know how to interpret that usually does a               |
| 18:52      | pretty good job.                                                                                    |
| 18:53      | It probably does with focus modes, but I always tap on it and make sure that I'm getting the        |
| 18:56      | name of the focus mode or the title of the thing if I'm trying to compare that.                     |
| 18:59      | So if focus mode is driving and I press this, uh, driving is probably a bad example.                |
| 19:04      | Uh, so let's go with sleep.                                                                         |
| 19:05      | If focus mode is sleep and I press my action button, um, so I've, I've got if focus, uh,            |
| 19:11      | you know, if focus mode asleep, do my actions and I'll have a stop shortcut inside of the           |
| 19:16      | if I won't have an otherwise.                                                                       |
| 19:18      | There's no otherwise.                                                                               |
| 19:19      | Um, and then end if, and then my next statement, if focus mode is, uh, work, if focus mode          |
| 19:26      | is podcasting and inside of each of those ifs, the last action is a stop shortcut, but              |
| 19:30      | I don't nest the ifs because what happens is when you nest the ifs, okay, you start with            |
| 19:35      | a shortcut that takes up, say the full width of the screen of your iPhone, okay, or most            |
| 19:39      | of the screen of an iPad, um, all the screen of an iPad with wise, if it's in vertical,             |
| 19:44      | uh, orientation portrait, if it's landscape, it'll have a menu over on the right side.              |
| 19:48      | Um, but once you start adding ifs, you start losing a little bit of space on the left every         |
| 19:54      | time.                                                                                               |
| 19:55      | You add too many ifs and you get something very, very, very skinny and it's quite difficult         |
| 19:59      | to, to read and it's tricky to work with.                                                           |
| 20:02      | So I would always recommend don't nest your ifs for something like this.                            |
| 20:06      | Um, you know, I really wish the shortcuts, uh, team could add a switch case or I could              |
| 20:10      | say, Hey, if it's this, do these actions else, if it's this, do these actions, else, if it's        |
| 20:17      | that, do these actions, you know, switch case, else, if whatever it is, um, but just a binary       |
| 20:21      | if and otherwise, it tends not to be so great, but the stop short connection is definitely          |
| 20:26      | going to be very useful in anything that you're building this like an action button one, because    |
| 20:31      | basically you're saying, okay, this was this, this was my, my context at this point, my,            |
| 20:36      | my focus mode, my location, whatever I'm doing this, I'm stopping.                                  |
| 20:41      | That's it.                                                                                          |
| 20:42      | End of game.                                                                                        |
| 20:43      | Finished.                                                                                           |
| 20:44      | And so anything that's underneath that you're, you're good, like it's not going to happen.          |
| 20:47      | You don't have to worry about that.                                                                 |
| 20:49      | Exactly.                                                                                            |
| 20:50      | Under the, if, once you've finished telling me what to do, there is an action called stop           |
| 20:55      | this shortcut.                                                                                      |
| 20:57      | And in fact, Rose, did you download the one I sent you, my, my, did you see, I did that.            |
| 21:03      | I did that.                                                                                         |
| 21:04      | I put the stop.                                                                                     |
| 21:05      | But you do have an otherwise end there that I think is possibly slightly unnecessary,               |
| 21:08      | but we'll, we'll take a look at that later.                                                         |
| 21:09      | We'll talk about that.                                                                              |
| 21:10      | But I just want to know whether or not I earned a Rosemary Orchard gold star for doing that.        |
| 21:14      | Because I feel like I, I should get at least one, but that's what you do.                           |
| 21:19      | You make, so you make a series of if statements and the, and the other reason you want to           |
| 21:23      | stop this shortcut is cause if you change the, let's say that one of your actions, like             |
| 21:30      | I've got one that when I leave the studio, I've got one of these action button shortcuts            |
| 21:37      | for me literally changes the focus mode as it's last step.                                          |
| 21:42      | So like if I am under work, I've got one say, you know, stop work.                                  |
| 21:48      | And then it turns out the lights and it switches my focus mode to personal, blah, blah, blah.       |
| 21:53      | Well, if I've got the if personal below, then it's going to run that one too, because I've          |
| 21:58      | changed the focus mode and now the condition that it's going to see what the later if is            |
| 22:02      | going to get triggered.                                                                             |
| 22:03      | I don't want it to do that.                                                                         |
| 22:04      | I just want it to run once.                                                                         |
| 22:06      | So that's another reason why the stop this shortcut can avoid anarchy with your shortcut.           |
| 22:13      | But it's, but that's the idea of it, if you're doing it based on focus modes, just gather           |
| 22:18      | the focus mode and then have it do an if, you know, if the focus mode equals this, then             |
| 22:27      | you can do things.                                                                                  |
| 22:28      | We're going to talk in the next segment about what we're actually doing with them, but that's       |
| 22:31      | a very simple way to set a contextual, you know, action button that does different things           |
| 22:37      | depending on where you are and what you're doing.                                                   |

| 24:58      | podcast all right well so I talked about checking focus modes but you have got some                 |
| 25:06      | based on time what's the best way to go about that to have the action button check the time         |
| 25:11      | before it tells decides what you're going to do well first of all I'm sorry Americans               |
| 25:18      | and folks who primarily use 12 hour time you are going to probably want to use 24 hour              |
| 25:24      | time to figure out time of day but we'll circle back to that in a moment but yeah I do have         |
| 25:28      | things figure out you know options appear or not appear somewhat depending on my current            |
| 25:35      | time of day and I say my current time of day because this is relative to where I am in              |
| 25:40      | the world okay it's not a hard coded if it's 9am in the UK then I want this option showing          |
| 25:46      | up it's you know obviously based on my device time so the first thing that I do is I use            |
| 25:53      | a format date action okay and I will format the date to just the time so I'm removing               |
| 26:00      | the time from the date and usually what I can what I do is I fetch things a bit and                 |
| 26:05      | I just use hours okay and this is why I use 24 hour hours because then you know I to is             |
| 26:12      | 2am 14 is 2pm it's very simple to figure out you know if it's never make a mistake or if            |
| 26:18      | it's after that time yeah never make a mistake that way yeah now there is of course a little        |
| 26:25      | bit of a difficulty of you know if something is at night so if it's like after 10pm and             |
| 26:30      | before 6am then then that's a little bit tricky but what I usually do is I figure out you           |
| 26:35      | know a logical start time for when I want you know options to be appearing so for example           |
| 26:40      | work related options you know like maybe starting work early and things like that I have a short    |
| 26:44      | cut for that that I can run this like hey you're starting work early so this is a time              |
| 26:48      | you should probably take lunch this time you should probably be finishing for the day and           |
| 26:51      | stuff like that and I want that to appear when I'm not in my work focus mode and I wanted           |
| 26:57      | to appear between 7am and 9am okay so what I do is I format the time I use 24 hour time             |
| 27:04      | and I say if time if the hours are greater than or equal to 7 and less than or equal                |
| 27:12      | to 9 then show me this so theoretically this will actually show up until 9.59am as I said           |
| 27:19      | I'm kind of fudging it a little bit but that's okay because 9.59am yeah I will probably already     |
| 27:23      | start to work but I can ignore that option appearing as an extra option when I don't                |
| 27:28      | need it but it's easier to kind of just fudge it and be like okay if it's between 7 and             |
| 27:33      | 9am then you know that's what I need and because I format it what I do is I format the date         |
| 27:43      | and I use a format date action with my current date okay and I format it to just the hours          |
| 27:47      | which is hh and capital letters and then I put that into a number action and the reason             |
| 27:53      | why I put that into a number action is because then I can you know easily do the is greater         |
| 27:59      | than or equal to and the is less than or equal to comparison there's also is between which          |
| 28:06      | is what I'm actually using for these so I'm saying if it is between because I wanted to             |
| 28:12      | appear like from 7am onwards I actually have to say that it's from 6 till 10 because between        |
| 28:21      | is inside of this range okay so if it's between 7 and 10 it would only appear like at 8am           |
| 28:29      | and until 8.59am and then go away does that make sense yeah yeah cool so yeah that's that's         |
| 28:37      | what I do to start with and what I try to do is sort of bracket my day into segments okay           |
| 28:44      | so I figure out you know what do I consider morning what do I consider lunchtime afternoon          |
| 28:51      | late afternoon evening should probably be going to bedtime should actually be in bedtime            |
| 28:57      | no really you should be asleep time and things like that and you know these are you know silly      |
| 29:02      | names for it but it's you know it's a handy sort of shorthand for figuring out okay what            |
| 29:07      | am I what am I considering various times a day and because I use this in more than one              |
| 29:10      | place I'm gonna throw out a mention to one of our good old friends that we've mentioned             |
| 29:14      | as an app before [[Data Jar]] came up in the last episode because I have all of the times that          |
| 29:22      | I consider you know like the brackets of my day in [[Data Jar]] because then I can reuse this           |
| 29:27      | in multiple shortcuts so I can say hey I consider morning to finish at 12 okay 12 noon so you       |
| 29:35      | know I can just get that out and if at any point I decide that I want to change it to               |
| 29:39      | one then I can I can do that and I do that in one place and it updates everywhere and               |
| 29:44      | it's quite convenient for for figuring these things out when you want it in multiple places         |
| 29:47      | because contexts aren't just for action buttons they're there for you know automations in           |
| 29:52      | general so so yeah I start I start with things like that you but you can also do you know           |
| 29:58      | if today is a Tuesday so I can format the date to just the day of the week and and and              |
| 30:06      | figure out if it's Tuesday a trick that you can use in English and German speaking languages        |
| 30:11      | and probably some other languages as well if you format your date with five capital                 |
| 30:16      | E's you'll take it down to a single letter S stands for Saturday and Sunday okay Samstag            |
| 30:23      | and Sontag in German and so that's a really handy shorthand for figuring out is it the              |
| 30:28      | weekend you could also do things like get contents of your calendar for calendar events             |
| 30:36      | from a holiday calendar to figure out if it's if it's a holiday day so it would also be             |
| 30:42      | weekend but yeah I generally start with just formatting it for the day of the week and              |
| 30:47      | the hour of the day to figure out you know what day is it and what time in very approximate         |
| 30:53      | terms is it and that gets me a pretty long way nice and so I mean we're doing kind of               |
| 31:00      | the same thing 'casuse I've got different automations that change focus modes for me through the        |
| 31:07      | day for various reasons it could be set on a clock or what I'm doing or where I'm located           |
| 31:13      | but then the action button is not triggering on time but it's triggering on with the focus          |
| 31:18      | mode so it's almost like a secondary automation of me changing the focus mode is also changing      |
| 31:24      | what action button sees when I pull the trigger so there's a lot that the point really is           |
| 31:31      | there's a lot of ways to do this we were talking earlier about Wi-Fi you could just have it         |
| 31:35      | run a Wi-Fi check what's the Wi-Fi on and if it's the name of your work then there's                |
| 31:41      | one set of actions and if it's the name of your home that's another set and if it's                 |
| 31:46      | neither maybe it's a third set and that stuff is all pretty simple to set up I mean you're          |
| 31:52      | just doing a check it's like so much automation you get a trigger and then you have an action       |
| 31:57      | in this case the trigger is you push the button and it checks to see whatever the context you're    |
| 32:02      | using as the basis for it and one of the points I wanted to make is you don't have to just          |
| 32:07      | use one context like mine has two contexts the first one it's checking is is the device             |
| 32:15      | face down and this also works if it's in my pocket so I like that it works in either one            |
| 32:20      | but it doesn't if check and it says if it is face down then what does it do well and                |
| 32:26      | and if it's face down then it's a silence it turns on silence and I kind of went back               |
| 32:31      | and forth on this because I the way I originally wrote it it had a more complex shortcut that       |
| 32:38      | check to see if the silent mode is on or off and then it engage the opposite of that or             |
| 32:43      | they do have a way where you could toggle it but I realised I only want that to do what             |
| 32:48      | if I'm pushing it it's because I want it to be quiet so it's an example of getting                  |
| 32:54      | too smart for your bridges with automation like oh I'm making this really fancy thing               |
| 32:59      | that I don't need all I want is if I push that button and it's face down in my pocket               |
| 33:03      | I want it to shut up I don't ever want it to stop shutting up if I do that so it made               |
| 33:08      | it a really easy shortcut if if the device is face down or in the pocket then you just              |
| 33:14      | it it turns silent on and I'm using a unique trigger for this it's called a device orientation      |
| 33:21      | call and we just did a show what was it about a month ago where we talked about other shortcut      |
| 33:27      | apps that add actions to shortcuts and actions the actions app for shortcuts adds the check         |
| 33:34      | device orientation toolbox pro does not do that at this point correct no no it doesn't              |
| 33:40      | have that specific action but it does have some other actions which can be quite useful             |
| 33:46      | for things like this so yeah just double checking because we've been working we've been working     |
| 33:53      | on toolbox pro update and I just want to double check what's in the current version                 |
| 33:57      | to make sure but there's things like getting device motion which can be pretty useful so            |
| 34:03      | that'll tell you you know if the device is currently moving or not moving which could               |
| 34:07      | be very very useful well let me just say to you while you're when your developer had                |
| 34:11      | that I love that you guys give each other that space that neither of you generally copy             |
| 34:18      | the other right it means that if I get both apps I doubled the number of actions available          |
| 34:23      | to me you know so but either way so the actions app has a thing that checks orientation to          |
| 34:28      | see if it's face down so you got to get a third-party app but once you get that I find              |
| 34:32      | it super useful now if my phone is face down it's my pocket I reach in I hold the action            |
| 34:36      | button and it's a silencer just like it was on every iPhone I've ever owned for my entire           |
| 34:41      | life so that the context of that is the location of the phone but then I just got done telling      |
| 34:47      | you that I'm doing a bunch based on on focus mode too so but what I'm doing is I'm using            |
| 34:52      | that magic stop this shortcut action so if it's face down in my pocket I hold down the              |
| 34:57      | action button it turns it on silent and that ends the shortcut so it doesn't check at that          |
| 35:03      | point it doesn't check my focus mode it doesn't care what my focus mode is it can I can be          |
| 35:07      | in sleep mode or podcast mode or whatever so long as my phone is face down or in my                 |
| 35:13      | pocket it's going to put it in silent mode and the important point here is the order                |
| 35:19      | that you put these things in because I made that the very first thing it checks if I made           |
| 35:23      | it the last thing it checks then it wouldn't work because it's always going to look at              |
| 35:27      | the focus mode it's never going to get to that check right so the you want to order these           |
| 35:32      | in order of priority and like if the the time of day is more important than the focus mode          |
| 35:39      | or the you know the face down status is more important the focus you got to put it on top           |
| 35:44      | but so that's my first thing is I check to see if the thing is face down and then silence           |
| 35:48      | itself yeah and I definitely spent a little bit of time sitting down and thinking okay              |
| 35:54      | what what do I want my default to be because the last thing I think that you should be              |
| 35:59      | setting yourself up for when you configure something like an action button is I press               |
| 36:04      | this button and I'm not 100% certain what it's going to do that's bad yeah well you                 |
| 36:09      | know depending on what you've got in there you know if you think you're pressing it and             |
| 36:13      | it's good trigger selling but you're not 100% certain is it going to start playing rise             |
| 36:18      | of the Valkyries or something like that at full volume because that's kind of the opposite          |
| 36:23      | of what you are hoping for so yeah start with the the simple things the sensible defaults           |
| 36:29      | and stuff like that and then you know duplicate your shortcut and experiment from there and         |
| 36:33      | then put the duplicated shortcut onto the action button with the old one as a backup                |
| 36:36      | and so on and you know you don't have to start with really complex context you know you can         |
| 36:41      | just say hey you know like turn on this focus mode like not even toggle this focus mode             |
| 36:47      | just turn it on like if I if I if I press this button just turn on this focus mode I'm              |
| 36:51      | good I'm happy with that and then you can branch out of okay so I press my action button            |
| 36:56      | and according to my phone I am in my fitness focus mode so I would like it to maybe play            |
| 37:02      | a playlist for me or maybe start a workout for me or you know an Apple Watch workout                |
| 37:08      | to be clear or maybe it can then go okay so she press the action button you know the device         |
| 37:14      | is unlocked and the focus mode is fitness she's not at home I'm going to start this                 |
| 37:22      | workout she is at home I'm going to work I'm gonna start this workout and play this music           |
| 37:29      | because when I'm not at home I don't want my phone randomly blasting out music when                 |
| 37:34      | I start a workout because you know if I'm doing an acrobatics class or a ballet class               |
| 37:38      | or something they tend to provide their own music so so adding to the noise is probably             |
| 37:42      | not gonna make me a lot of friends but similarly you know if I am in airplane mode I'm gonna        |
| 37:48      | want totally different things to be happening and airplane mode that's that's a nice easy           |
| 37:54      | easy one to just sort of think about you know if you're in airplane mode well what do you           |
| 37:59      | want when you're on a plane probably music right you know if your iPods are connected               |
| 38:04      | then then you're probably gonna want some music so yeah I think try and think of you                |
| 38:09      | know the very simple things that are okay if it's this that's gonna happen very simple              |
| 38:13      | done and what you can do for each of these which I would recommend maybe create a folder            |
| 38:19      | hold action button and each of your different you know actions that you would potentially           |
| 38:24      | want to happen at different times create them as a separate shortcut and then you can just          |
| 38:28      | use the run shortcut action so you can have like you know your logic in one place figuring          |
| 38:32      | it all out and then the actual actions that happen after that they're just a separate               |
| 38:37      | shortcut so you can you know adjust the logic and move things around without worrying about         |
| 38:41      | losing the actual individual actions that you set up which could be you know it could               |
| 38:45      | be two steps it could be four steps could be one step but it can be really useful to                |
| 38:50      | have these as shortcuts yeah and so what Rose just talked about was like a ninja level trick        |
| 38:55      | because you you trigger another shortcut then you can have if statements in there and even          |
| 39:01      | nest them if you want and it's still completely readable it's editable you don't have to worry      |
| 39:07      | about a shortcut I think it's overwhelming in size and I think if you did that Rose would           |
| 39:12      | give you two gold stars oh definitely I think she would because you should do it that way           |
| 39:18      | that's not the way I did it I just set them up in one because I was having fun playing              |
| 39:22      | with it it's early days for me but you know what I think after this break we need to go             |
| 39:27      | through we need to just get down to it Rose we need to share what we're doing with our              |
| 39:30      | shortcut buttons I mean this is so sneaky David because I am just constantly in flux                |
| 39:36      | on this and I I simultaneously know exactly what I doing and I don't know what I'm doing            |
| 39:41      | because I'm on like my third Shortcuts action button this week and it's Monday so you know         |
| 39:46      | we're gonna have to figure out which one of these I'm gonna talk about or maybe I'll talk           |
| 39:50      | about all of them and just share one of them I caught myself before the break I was calling         |
| 39:53      | it the shortcuts button and it's actually the action button but it we're running shortcuts          |
| 39:59      | from it so yeah it's it to me it's the shortcuts button and that's what it will always be in        |
| 40:04      | fact one quick side note here I have an Apple Watch Ultra that also has an action button            |
| 40:10      | I am not having nearly as much fun with the watch action button as I am with the phone              |
| 40:15      | I mean when you have the full shortcuts the big screen it just gives you so many more               |
| 40:20      | options than the watch action button does you know just there's no the if you're used               |
| 40:27      | to using it on the Apple Watch Ultra like it's gonna be just like that no this is this              |
| 40:30      | is better but anyway let me let me let's just go through and share what we're doing I'm             |
| 40:37      | gonna go first Rose because I have a feeling yours is more complex than mine well my current        |
| 40:42      | iteration of it is very very simple it's it's literally just you know giving me a menu with         |
| 40:47      | with two options because I have I've been having a little fun with an app that is gonna             |
| 40:53      | be in Tesla and we'll share about that in a moment but you can still go ahead and start             |
| 40:57      | so what I do is like I said before the break is the first thing is I check if it's face             |
| 41:01      | down and it's a silence button which is you know the number one goal of this thing you              |
| 41:07      | know my daughter does a lot of play stuff and I don't ever want to be sitting in a theatre          |
| 41:12      | and have that thing go off but after that then the next thing it does is it checks focus            |
| 41:18      | mode and everything for me is based on focus mode I have not been tempted to use times              |
| 41:24      | and locations and stuff because I don't feel the need the focus mode stuff works so good            |
| 41:30      | and like some of my focus modes are triggered by location already like I have a focus mode          |
| 41:35      | called Disneyland that's triggered when I'm at Disneyland so now the action button is               |
| 41:40      | naturally going to reflect the Disneyland choices not because it's looking to see my                |
| 41:46      | locations because my phones are already seen the location and put me in that focus mode             |
| 41:51      | so focus modes for me are what it's all about and then in them I've got multiple different          |
| 41:58      | actions and I just literally went through every one of my focus modes and said what                 |
| 42:03      | would I like it to do in the case of this right and so as an example I have one that                |
| 42:09      | is what if there is no focus mode right what if you check it and that none of them are              |
| 42:14      | selected well then it triggers an action that lets me select a focus mode because I'm always        |
| 42:19      | in a focus mode I have one called personal so if I'm not in work I'm in a personal focus            |
| 42:24      | mode then so then this is well what happens if you're in the focus the personal focus               |
| 42:28      | mode well then there's a couple things I'm using a choose from menu like I was talking              |
| 42:33      | about earlier but this is a choose from menu that only works on personal stuff because              |
| 42:38      | I'm in the personal mode so I've got one here to run my nap timer because I like to take            |
| 42:43      | a nap I've got one to open Kindle so I can read a book I've got one to track time because           |
| 42:50      | I track time all day I've got one that takes me to a specific website where I can make              |
| 42:55      | a reservation for Disneyland because that's how we roll in the Spark family and I also              |
| 43:00      | have one in there to check my print because I've been having so much fun with this 3D               |
| 43:06      | printer and my printer has an app and sometimes I just want to check the status of the print        |
| 43:11      | I hold down the action button click check printed opens up the app and shows me because a little    |
| 43:15      | camera and my printer the last one and all of my focus modes is new focus mode because              |
| 43:22      | sometimes I just want to change a focus mode and I know there's a million ways I can do             |
| 43:26      | that but since I've got an action button here I went ahead and added that as well so that's         |
| 43:30      | my personal list any comments Rose on that before I move on to the next one no I mean               |
| 43:37      | I think that works really well for somebody like you who's nearly always in focus modes             |
| 43:42      | and so on you know I don't live my life inside of focus modes I tend to have focus modes            |
| 43:47      | on and then my default is off though to be honest I'm mostly in a focus mode but my default         |
| 43:52      | isn't in a focus mode so yeah I think that that's a really smart way of doing it and                |
| 43:58      | yeah I like the idea of the Disney one in particular and Disney and the 3D printer are              |
| 44:04      | you just using the the open app actions for those two to open the app yeah well no the              |
| 44:09      | Disney one okay you want me to give you a rant on the Disneyland app because I could                |
| 44:15      | it is it is terrible but in the Disneyland app if you want to make a reservation it kicks           |
| 44:21      | you out to a browser and goes to a specific web page and then it makes you log in every             |
| 44:29      | time you do it the username and password and then it sends you a confirming email that              |
| 44:34      | you just logged in to the website and then it shows you the available reservations it's             |
| 44:40      | the most asinine thing I've ever seen but so what I do is I just copy the URL and then              |
| 44:46      | I just have it jump to the web page to skip the app entirely but they still did they even           |
| 44:52      | made it worse recently they used to be thing where the username and password were one screen        |
| 44:57      | so and with you know 1Password or Apple passwords I could just have it autofill but              |
| 45:02      | now it's got to go through two screens it's nuts but anyway that's going that's a URL               |
| 45:06      | call it's just going to a web page but the printer is just opening an app and these things          |
| 45:11      | don't need to be super difficult yeah the for a podcasting I have a podcasting focus                |
| 45:17      | mode same thing but some of the stuff I do I have one called check time it gives me the             |
| 45:21      | time in London for so I know what time it is for Rose I've got one called notify sparks             |
| 45:28      | prime it's just a text message a pre-canned text message to my family says guys I'm recording       |
| 45:33      | for the next two hours leave me alone and I have a light outside my window my door here             |
| 45:38      | that turns on but my family isn't always respectful of that or they just don't look at it so I      |
| 45:44      | send them a text to but I also have the ability to turn the recording light on offer on and         |
| 45:49      | some other stuff for podcasting you know all these are just the whole idea here is to just          |
| 45:53      | pick what is it you want it to do like I have a Disneyland focus mode which is a triggered          |
| 45:59      | by location so if I hold the action button down and and iPhone says hey he's in Disneyland          |
| 46:05      | mode then there's no menu it just opens a camera it says okay well he's at Disneyland               |
| 46:09      | he probably wants to take a picture open the camera there's no nothing to choose from so            |
| 46:13      | I'm getting the benefit of a dedicated action button for just one thing open the camera             |
| 46:18      | but it only does that when I'm at Disneyland when I'm doing just general work with Max              |
| 46:24      | Sparky I can start up and shut down work and some other things I've got one called production       |
| 46:31      | where when I'm recording and there's a whole bunch of different lighting rigs and stuff             |
| 46:35      | I do in the studio and I've got the ability to trigger all of those off the action button           |
| 46:40      | and let's see here what else have I got oh when I'm in the car this was a clever one                |
| 46:47      | when I'm driving I didn't know what to do with that one right I mean you don't have to do           |
| 46:51      | something for everyone but I wanted to so if I hold on the action button when I'm driving           |
| 46:55      | it gets my current location and texts it to my wife I don't have to even look at the screen         |
| 47:00      | it's like it's just like the toggle sleep and wake right if the car is in driving mode              |
| 47:05      | my phone is down kind of on the side of me because it's connected to car play I don't               |
| 47:11      | know if I'll ever use this because I could also I don't know I don't know if I'll ever              |
| 47:15      | use it but I added one where I hold on the action button while I'm driving it since                 |
| 47:18      | my wife my location I know you think of a better use for that I don't know I mean you               |
| 47:24      | could just have it play like a particular playlist or continue playing an overcast                  |
| 47:28      | or something like that that's what I've set mine to do because I do tend to have my phone           |
| 47:34      | on a charger in the car you know I my my clothing is not always blessed with the luxury of pockets  |
| 47:41      | and definitely not pockets that necessarily fit a phone if you if I ever find a dress               |
| 47:46      | that will actually have pockets that fits a phone I'm so excited and I have to buy the              |
| 47:49      | dress immediately of course but yeah it's you know so I tend to have to put my phone                |
| 47:55      | and then also I'm putting on charge so it's definitely not gonna be flat when I get where           |
| 47:57      | I'm going and so I just have the action button trigger a playlist for me of music or and            |
| 48:07      | this is where I've got a little bit smarter because I've been working on the shortcut               |
| 48:12      | for a while it figures out kind of based on time of day basically if I will probably want           |
| 48:19      | to listen to a podcast or music and then just goes from there and goes okay I'm gonna play          |
| 48:23      | this place or I'm gonna you know play this podcast it's not perfect doesn't always get              |
| 48:27      | it right but it does give me you know most of the time I'd say like 90% of the time it              |
| 48:32      | gets it right and yeah so that's pretty good and if I know that I want a specific thing             |
| 48:38      | that's easy enough to tap on car play before I start driving to just start those but most           |
| 48:42      | of the time I can just press the action button and off it goes yeah I have one for sleep            |
| 48:46      | mode if I'm in the sleeping focus mode and it's currently a choose for a menu the main              |
| 48:52      | one is capture thought it's a [[Drafts]] action just create a draft with dictation like in              |
| 48:57      | the middle light you're thinking about something and your mind gets on a loop you're like okay      |
| 49:02      | I need to write this down so I can like let go of it and go to sleep so I just trigger              |
| 49:06      | that and I just talk real quick to my phone and it captures the thought and then I'm good           |
| 49:11      | I think I'm going to change this action button to remove the menu and just make it capture          |
| 49:18      | thought I also have options to open up the Kindle app and do a couple of things but you             |
| 49:23      | know I should embed I should be sleeping I shouldn't be opening Kindle app so I think               |
| 49:28      | I'm going to change that one to just capture thought and do not disturb to me is like the           |
| 49:33      | time when I'm really focused on a project I don't want to be bothered and I have it                 |
| 49:37      | where it can play a thunderstorm through [[Dark Noise]] I also have a capture thought when and          |
| 49:41      | there because if you're working on something hard and random thoughts appear that don't             |
| 49:45      | relate to what you're working on it's nice to be able to capture those and move on but              |
| 49:50      | so what I've done basically just gone through each focus mode some of them have a single            |
| 49:54      | action like Disneyland others have a menu that I can choose from but you know no matter             |
| 49:58      | what I'm doing if I hold on the action button I get generally a list of the stuff that I            |
| 50:03      | need to see and I've been refining it over time and I've been really enjoying it this               |
| 50:08      | is a great automation exercise because you can learn all sorts of cool stuff with shortcuts         |
| 50:13      | while you're at it yes and I think that's the thing you know the action button is you               |
| 50:19      | know one of those things where it seems like well I'll just use it to trigger silent mode           |
| 50:24      | okay but if I'm in silent mode and I press it again maybe actually I wanted to put on               |
| 50:28      | do not disturb for me and things like that now you're not necessarily gonna be able to              |
| 50:32      | get the status of all of these so you might have to you know do something smart and figure          |
| 50:36      | it out another way but you know it is you know one of those things where you can absolutely         |
| 50:45      | you know take advantage of the fact that you have a button on your phone that can do magic          |
| 50:51      | when you press it and you are the person who can say what magic it does and I'm sure some           |
| 50:57      | of you are going I'm not smart enough to do this I can't figure this out I promise you              |
| 51:01      | you can start by just having a look at the actions in shortcuts because things like silent          |
| 51:06      | mode okay if you want to toggle silent mode you don't need to figure out if silent mode             |
| 51:10      | is on or silent mode is off you can just use the silent mode action and then change it from         |
| 51:16      | turn on and turn off to toggle the turn on turn off bit has a toggle option so you actually         |
| 51:22      | don't need to write a bunch of logic in there the actions will do it for you and this is            |
| 51:26      | the really great advantage of shortcuts because it can you know just hide a bunch of magic          |
| 51:31      | under the hood and make things happen for you so you know that that is one of the reasons           |
| 51:37      | why I really love it. So Rose share your super action shortcut with us. Well so I'm on as           |
| 51:44      | I mentioned my third iteration like today and that's because the reason for this is something       |
| 51:51      | I kind of mentioned earlier so [[Alex Hay]] had an app that was in beta before he passed away           |
| 51:57      | and it was very popular with some folks so we've been going through it doing a couple               |
| 52:01      | of polishes and updates and we are announcing a public [[TestFlight]] of menu box where you            |
| 52:07      | can make really lovely pretty menus for shortcuts with icons in and it can give you different       |
| 52:13      | bits of data on the output and things like that you can create these menus in shortcuts             |
| 52:18      | you can add to them and modify them and all sorts of fabulous things which is great and             |
| 52:24      | you know I've been playing with that a lot but when I say my action button's been in                |
| 52:28      | flux I'm really not kidding I'm like my third shortcut using menu box today. I am going to          |
| 52:34      | just have a little you know side note of something I need file feedback about and I would like      |
| 52:40      | other folks to file feedback about this as well. I really wish I could get the battery              |
| 52:43      | status of other devices from my phone in shortcuts like my watch and my AirPods because one of      |
| 52:51      | the things that I have been experimenting with as part of my action button is prompts               |
| 52:57      | to do the things that really need doing. So for example if it's after 11pm and I press              |
| 53:04      | my action button the first menu item that appears at the top is just titled go to bed               |
| 53:10      | it's very simple because it's a reminder hey you're messing around on your phone you're             |
| 53:16      | doing whatever go to bed and it's you know it's just an attempt to help me. I'd really              |
| 53:21      | love it if it could say charge your watch because I switched from an Apple Watch Ultra              |
| 53:25      | I've still got my Apple Watch Ultra but I switched down to a Series 9 because I wanted              |
| 53:31      | to experiment with the tap actions where you tap your finger and thumb together which is            |
| 53:36      | going to be coming in the next release of watch OS and oh my gosh has that been a learning          |
| 53:42      | curve to remember that I have to charge my watch. It feels like I'm running out of charge           |
| 53:46      | like every five minutes it's like when I last charge it two days ago. That explains why             |
| 53:51      | it's on 1% battery. I should definitely charge that again. So yeah I wish I could do that           |
| 53:56      | but one of the things that I always have in my action button menu is a simple capture               |
| 54:05      | action. Now this capture action is very very simple. It opens [[Drafts]] and it opens [[Drafts]]           |
| 54:09      | to a particular workspace with a new draft so I then have a series of actions in the                |
| 54:15      | action button row which appears above the keyboard which allows me to do things like                |
| 54:20      | input dates and things like that so if I'm capturing a task or whatever then I can easily           |
| 54:24      | add a date to it and times and stuff like that which has been extremely helpful for                 |
| 54:30      | my productivity just being able to quickly capture things and dump them into the system             |
| 54:35      | which is part of the trusted system. And I don't use dictation on this because there's              |
| 54:40      | a dictation button right on the keyboard so I can just open that in [[Drafts]] and I also               |
| 54:46      | have the magic [[Drafts]] dictation option in there as well if I want it. So my first option            |
| 54:54      | is possibly reminding me that I should be doing something like going to sleep and my                |
| 54:59      | second option is always capture. The next option that appears is contextual. It depends             |
| 55:07      | on whether or not there's something in my calendar in the next 90 minutes. Now I need               |
| 55:12      | to work on refining this a little bit because honestly if I have a podcast recording any            |
| 55:16      | time today I would also like that to be present. But if I have a calendar event within the          |
| 55:22      | next 90 minutes it appears in there and then when I tap on that calendar event it gives             |
| 55:30      | me the option of getting the details of it or preparing for the event. So when that one             |
| 55:37      | gets tapped it's just preparing for the event is running a shortcut that will open up relevant      |
| 55:44      | notes if they exist and create them if they don't exist and things like that with little            |
| 55:48      | templates. So yeah, that's the first sort of series of things. The next segment tends               |
| 55:55      | to be the time dependent ones. So at the moment this is predominantly things like starting          |
| 56:00      | work early and stuff like that which will appear and I will use context, time and focus             |
| 56:06      | mode contexts possibly together, possibly separately to trigger those. So that's that bit. And      |
| 56:17      | then other than that it is very much dependent on focus mode. So if it's driving I mentioned        |
| 56:25      | before it's going to either play music or play a podcast through the run shortcut action.           |
| 56:30      | If it is my work focus mode it actually does exactly what I've talked about here but it             |
| 56:37      | also has a separate option for like open [[Obsidian]] to my notes for work specifically so I can        |
| 56:48      | go straight into my work notes in [[Obsidian]] which can be very useful. And yeah, and then             |
| 56:54      | podcasting I need work on this one because I would really like it to figure out which               |
| 56:59      | podcast I'm recording and pop up things a little bit differently. If I've got an automated          |
| 57:04      | podcast anytime today I'd love it to give me the option to open the show notes for                  |
| 57:09      | today and things like that but I think I need to work on finding that just a little bit             |
| 57:13      | before I can really take advantage of that.                                                         |
| 57:16      | Yeah, it would be so easy to solve this problem. Just give us more focus modes, right? I mean       |
| 57:21      | it's just not that hard. I mean it's still dressing nuts that we only get 10. It's such             |
| 57:27      | an arbitrary number.                                                                                |
| 57:29      | Yes, but I have finally found a use case David for the set focus mode filter because that           |
| 57:37      | has allowed me to sort of duplicate some settings across focus modes. So yeah, it's been quite      |
| 57:46      | useful for things like that.                                                                        |
| 57:48      | Well I am loving this action button and it delights me every time I pick it up and like             |
| 57:55      | before we started recording today I picked it up. I held it down. I turned the recording            |
| 58:00      | light button on on my phone and it turned on outside the door and that's golden or like             |
| 58:08      | when we went to Disneyland a week and a half ago and I saw something fun and I just held            |
| 58:13      | up my phone and held up the action button and it opened up the camera for me because                |
| 58:17      | I was at Disneyland. I think this is great and I think this is a real opportunity for               |
| 58:22      | people who listen to this show to make their phone do some cool tricks. Share the love              |
| 58:27      | of automation frankly when your friends and family see that it does different things for            |
| 58:31      | you depending on where you're at or what you're doing, they're going to want you to show them       |
| 58:36      | how you did that. So you can kind of flex your automator muscles.                                   |
| 58:40      | Yes, yeah. Is your wife still using that NSC trick that you set up for her David where              |
| 58:46      | she scans her magic band from Disney then it will open the app for her?                             |
| 58:51      | Yes, but we don't use the magic bands in Anaheim very often because they're much more useful        |
| 58:58      | in Florida. But yeah, it's great. I mean, she hasn't been to Florida in some time but               |
| 59:03      | yeah, it's awesome.                                                                                 |
| 59:05      | Just thinking maybe now you have a 3D printer, you should print her Disneyland California           |
| 59:10      | special magic band that she can wear for Disney California which will have an NSC chip in           |
| 59:16      | it that will do Disney on California things for her.                                                |
| 59:19      | Well she has. Disney California now has magic bands, but they don't do anything. I mean             |
| 59:25      | like they get you, they'll get, it'll be your ticket, it'll get you in a park, it'll get            |
| 59:30      | you on rides. But in Florida it opens your hotel room and you can buy stuff with them               |
| 59:36      | and they're just much more useful in Florida. So she has one that she never wears. So I             |
| 59:40      | don't need to even print her one. She just doesn't wear it.                                         |
| 59:43      | Maybe if you 3D printed her something really cool, she would wear it more because it would          |
| 59:47      | just be super funky with her own special custom Mickey or Minnie design on there that you've          |
| 59:51      | drawn out for her.                                                                                  |
| 59:52      | Yeah, or a year or two from now when she inherits this phone, I'm going to take all the automation  |
| 59:58      | off and anytime she holds the action button, it's just going to be Mickey's voice saying,           |
| 01:00:03   | hi Daisy, how are you today? And she'll think that's the greatest thing in the world.               |
| 01:00:08   | But honestly, this is something that folks should definitely look into doing for their              |
| 01:00:12   | friends and family members, like have a cute voice say something as they press the action           |
| 01:00:16   | button in lesser in silent mode, obviously, because that could be really useful for folks           |
| 01:00:22   | like that. And the action button on the Ultra, you touched on this before David, it's not           |
| 01:00:27   | as good as the phone. This is one of the reasons why I had the Ultra last year. I'm keeping         |
| 01:00:32   | the Ultra for testing purposes and to periodically try out with things. But first of all, the       |
| 01:00:39   | Ultra action button seems slow in comparison to the action button on the iPhone.                    |
| 01:00:45   | And secondly, you create a shortcut and that doesn't appear in the list that you can choose         |
| 01:00:54   | because some action in there doesn't sync over to your watch. And that's why it's not               |
| 01:00:58   | working. But it's not obvious that you've done that. And so you remove a bunch of actions           |
| 01:01:03   | and then it appears. So you select it and then you add some actions back and then it                |
| 01:01:06   | stops working. And it's really tricky to figure out what is going to work and what isn't            |
| 01:01:12   | going to work there. So yeah, it's a shame that the action button on the Ultra isn't                |
| 01:01:18   | more customisable. You can do things like Apple Watch workouts and stuff from there,                |
| 01:01:23   | which I really loved. But because it was so slow, I found myself just adding complications          |
| 01:01:28   | to a watch face and tapping those instead.                                                          |
| 01:01:31   | So I tried to make the Ultra button work. I wrote a shortcut for it. And because you                |
| 01:01:36   | don't really have the screen access you do with the iPhone and you're right, it executes            |
| 01:01:40   | them slowly. And I have to make an automator's admission here. I'm just using it to start           |
| 01:01:47   | workouts now because I just kind of gave up trying to make it run shortcuts for me where            |
| 01:01:52   | I had just the opposite experience with the phone. The action button on the phone is super          |
| 01:01:56   | useful for shortcuts. But anyway, I don't want to end it on a downer. If you've got                 |
| 01:02:00   | a new phone with an action button, try this out. Rose and I will share some in the notes            |
| 01:02:05   | that you can download and use as a kick in off point. But this stuff is fun and there's             |
| 01:02:12   | a lot you can do with it. And it is truly useful automation. I mean, you pick up your               |
| 01:02:17   | phone and you push a button on it and it gives you exactly what you need based on where you're      |
| 01:02:22   | located or what time of day it is or what focus mode you're in. That's useful stuff.                |
| 01:02:28   | So please give it a try and let us know what you're doing. I'm sure some of our listeners           |
| 01:02:32   | are going to have better ideas than we did. I'd love to hear them back from you. Maybe              |
| 01:02:35   | add it to a feedback episode, but let us know. Yeah. And also, you know, I mentioned earlier        |
| 01:02:40   | there's that menu box beta because, you know, we really want to get Alex's app out there.           |
| 01:02:46   | We're also going to be releasing an update to toolbox pro folks. But unfortunately, this            |
| 01:02:51   | one comes with a little bit of a warning when Apple transferred the app to us. The way that         |
| 01:02:57   | it worked out is that if we when we update this global variables and bookmark folders               |
| 01:03:02   | are going to disappear and there's literally nothing we can do about this other than help           |
| 01:03:08   | you get it back if you've got a Mac. So I'm saying this now. If you're using global variables       |
| 01:03:13   | or bookmark or folder bookmarks until books pro, please back them up to make your life              |
| 01:03:18   | easier and therefore our lives easier. And we're very, very sorry. There's there's no               |
| 01:03:22   | way that we can not break that when we do the update. And we do need to do the update               |
| 01:03:27   | because [[Apple Music]] has got a little bit of a weirdness that we've we've figured out how            |
| 01:03:32   | to work around for that. But the good news is, is we've also got that menu box beta and             |
| 01:03:37   | menu box is such a good pairing with the with the action button. Honestly, it's it's so             |
| 01:03:42   | much fun. I love having all the different icons and things there that really, you know,             |
| 01:03:47   | if I've, you know, when I'm getting a menu to appear, it's actually a really nice looking           |
| 01:03:51   | menu that, you know, looks like it's part of the UI. So that's, that's one of the things            |
| 01:03:56   | that I really like about, you know, a good shortcut, it can really, you know, just it               |
| 01:04:01   | doesn't feel like a shortcut. It doesn't feel like a hack. It feels like it's part of the           |
| 01:04:04   | phone experience.                                                                                   |
| 01:04:05   | Yeah, I'm going to be digging in on that. I just got in the beta myself. I can't wait               |
| 01:04:09   | to give that a try. And the, you know, the nature of toolbox pro is it's always going               |
| 01:04:13   | to be evolving, I would think, because Apple is going to Sherlock some of the stuff you             |
| 01:04:18   | guys do is they add it to their own features or make changes. But the good news is, you             |
| 01:04:23   | know, the toolbox pro team has a list of mile long of stuff they want to add.                       |
| 01:04:27   | If it were only a mile long, our life would be so much easier. Our task management system           |
| 01:04:31   | is literally exploding at the seams with all of the feature requests that we've got and             |
| 01:04:35   | our ideas of our own and things like that that we've, we've got in there. So it's, you              |
| 01:04:40   | know, don't like ascend, send requests and please do folks, you know, we're always happy            |
| 01:04:45   | to hear them, but we have so many requests and it's, it's genuinely amazing to see how              |
| 01:04:50   | much love there is and has been for [[Alex Hay]], and we've passed a whole bunch of down               |
| 01:04:55   | to his family as well, you know, letting them know, you know, the, the lovely things that           |
| 01:04:59   | people have said, which, you know, is why we took over the apps.                                    |
| 01:05:02   | Well, I just love that toolbox pro is back under active development and I, I will be                |
| 01:05:07   | looking forward to every new release Rose and thanks for sharing that with us. Meantime,            |
| 01:05:12   | if you've got that button on your phone and you're not using it, spend some time as we              |
| 01:05:16   | can use it. Look at the stuff we're sharing with you from the show. Let us know what you're         |
| 01:05:20   | doing. The action button is a lot of fun and it's a, it's some great automation. We are             |
| 01:05:25   | the Automators podcast. You can find us at relay.fm/automators. We want to thank              |
