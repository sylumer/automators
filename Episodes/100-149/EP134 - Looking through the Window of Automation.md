| 00:00      | Welcome the Automators, I'm David Sparks and joined by Rosemary Orchard.                              |
| 00:06      | This is the Automators where we talk about how to automate your technology to do your                 |
| 00:09      | work for you.                                                                                         |
| 00:10      | Hi Rosemary.                                                                                          |
| 00:11      | Hey David, how are you?                                                                               |
| 00:13      | I am quite excited.                                                                                   |
| 00:15      | We have one of our favourite Automators here today.                                                    |
| 00:18      | Welcome to the show, Sal Soghoian.                                                                   |
| 00:21      | Greetings everybody.                                                                                  |
| 00:22      | It's such a thrill to be with you today.                                                              |
| 00:25      | It's my favourite podcast.                                                                             |
| 00:26      | I listen to you all the time.                                                                         |
| 00:29      | I feel like that is a burden for me because you are so smart with automation.                         |
| 00:33      | I'm like, oh man, I say things and South's like, no, that's not the way to do it.                     |
| 00:38      | David, you also set yourself up there because you said at the start, you're quite excited.            |
| 00:43      | You're not really excited.                                                                            |
| 00:44      | You're not super excited.                                                                             |
| 00:46      | You're not amazing, awesome, fantastic, excited.                                                      |
| 00:48      | You're just quite excited.                                                                            |
| 00:50      | So, you know, everything's going to go wrong from here on out.                                        |
| 00:53      | It all depends on how you define quite and quite to me is quite important.                            |
| 00:57      | There you go, right?                                                                                  |
| 00:58      | No, but Sal, you were, I think, our first guest on the Automators podcast.                            |
| 01:02      | Was I really?                                                                                         |
| 01:04      | Yeah, you were my Sherpa.                                                                             |
| 01:05      | I'm not even sure if I'm supposed to use that word anymore, but you were my Sherpa                    |
| 01:10      | into [[AppleScript]].                                                                                    |
| 01:11      | Years and years ago, I took your multi-day course at Mac World.                                       |
| 01:15      | That was quite the course, wasn't it?                                                                 |
| 01:17      | It was so fun.                                                                                        |
| 01:18      | That was like two days, seven hours each day, something like that.                                    |
| 01:22      | Yeah, but you just bathed us in it.                                                                   |
| 01:25      | The other thing that Sal did.                                                                         |
| 01:27      | Sal used to be a mucky muck at [[Apple]].                                                                 |
| 01:31      | You were the guy, really, who, you know, who brought automation to all the teams and was,             |
| 01:36      | you know, auto the automator and automation all came, you know, came from Sal and some                |
| 01:40      | very smart people over there.                                                                         |
| 01:42      | But Sal would tell us stuff, too.                                                                     |
| 01:44      | You know, I remember you told me that there's a room at [[Apple]] where there's just a drain              |
| 01:49      | in the floor.                                                                                         |
| 01:50      | And after Steve Jobs would come through and look at your product, they just washed the                |
| 01:54      | blood off the floor, off the walls of the floor, and I thought that was so funny.                     |
| 01:58      | Yeah, it was over in building three.                                                                  |
| 02:00      | Well, that one, I gotcha.                                                                             |
| 02:03      | Okay, that explains why I, yeah, I haven't heard of it from us and friends who started                |
| 02:07      | recently there.                                                                                       |
| 02:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 02:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 02:10      | Back at the old campus, but Sal, you really are an inspiration to so many of us in automation         |
| 02:16      | because at a time when automation wasn't getting the focus it gets now, you were there advocating     |
| 02:22      | for it and so we love having you on the show.                                                         |
| 02:26      | But also, you just come up with the coolest stuff because you do listen to the show we                |
| 02:31      | know because recently I was bemoaning the loss of a very excellent plug-in for OmniFocus              |
| 02:38      | that worked with [[Alfred]] and it allowed me to jump to my various perspectives and folders              |
| 02:43      | with just a couple taps and, you know, and it broke for various reasons and the guy who               |
| 02:48      | put it together never had time to go back and fix it or the technology he was using                   |
| 02:53      | wasn't working anymore and then one day Sal just sends me a little link and he's rebuilt              |
| 02:58      | the whole thing and now we're going to put a link in the show notes.                                  |
| 03:03      | Anybody that's using OmniFocus, you need to check this out, OmniFocus and [[Alfred]].                     |
| 03:07      | But you just did this on the side, Sal, and I wanted to talk about on the show, we got                |
| 03:11      | a lot of topics to go over with you today, but this one just delighted me because it                  |
| 03:16      | really solved a problem for me.                                                                       |
| 03:20      | I know you're doing some work with Omni Group now, but when you heard that that thing was              |
| 03:25      | dead, what did you go through as an automator to rebuild it?                                          |
| 03:29      | Well, one of the things about your show that I love is I always leave it on and I listen              |
| 03:35      | to a particular episode multiple times because I might not be catching everything while it's          |
| 03:42      | going down, right?                                                                                    |
| 03:44      | And I heard this thing about [[Alfred]] and I kept popping up in my brain and I said, okay,               |
| 03:50      | I'm going to sit down and look at this.                                                               |
| 03:52      | And I looked at the potential and what they had done and the [[Alfred]] team had upgraded                 |
| 03:58      | to Alfred 5 with a lot of new interoperability features so that you could talk to it in               |
| 04:06      | different ways like with URLs and things.                                                             |
| 04:09      | And I looked at the situation and I said, okay, what do we have to work with?                         |
| 04:14      | And of course, Omni Automation, the depth and the scope of that is so big that it allowed             |
| 04:23      | me to pretty quickly come up with the basic scenarios of, okay, I want to run a command               |
| 04:31      | from [[Alfred]] with no input that does something and OmniFocus with no input.                            |
| 04:37      | I want to use input in [[Alfred]] that does something in OmniFocus.                                       |
| 04:42      | I want something that uses input and then returns a list.                                             |
| 04:46      | So I figured out all the different combinations that you would use and tried to come up with          |
| 04:51      | some kind of interesting example for each one so that our customers could see how it's                |
| 04:58      | done and then replicate that and make their own.                                                      |
| 05:04      | And the folks at [[Alfred]], I contacted them and told them about what I was interested                   |
| 05:10      | in doing and they were so helpful guiding me through learning their product and taking                |
| 05:17      | advantage of the features that they add.                                                              |
| 05:20      | They have a lot of setup features that are built in.                                                  |
| 05:23      | And quickly came to a nice subset of [[Alfred]] actions that pretty much show you how to get              |
| 05:32      | it to various core parts of an Omni application through either Omni Automation or through             |
| 05:38      | Apple events.                                                                                         |
| 05:39      | They also included some Apple event examples in there.                                                |
| 05:43      | It was a lot of fun and I can see why you like that product so much.                                  |
| 05:48      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 05:49      | Well, [[Alfred]] is really powerful and they have embraced automation.                                    |
| 05:54      | This kind of gets to my core automation stories.                                                      |
| 05:59      | I did software development as a kid as we all did, as all us nerds did back in the day                |
| 06:06      | before the internet and you had to go get the magazine and copy the code out of the                   |
| 06:10      | back and things like that.                                                                            |
| 06:12      | But then at some point I realised this isn't something I have time for to figure out how              |
| 06:17      | to write my own software and do it efficiently and effectively.                                       |
| 06:20      | But what if I could take the software other people are writing and glue it together to                |
| 06:24      | become my own personal robot and do the things I wanted to do and that is something anybody           |
| 06:31      | listening to the show can do.                                                                         |
| 06:33      | That's why we make a show.                                                                            |
| 06:35      | And that's what you did here.                                                                         |
| 06:37      | You took [[Alfred]], which is a great app that's sending information to your Mac with just                |
| 06:42      | a couple keystrokes and taught it to do stuff in OmniFocus.                                           |
| 06:49      | Just to give you an example, one of the things I like to do is sometimes I need to go into            |
| 06:53      | a specific project.                                                                                   |
| 06:56      | You made it now.                                                                                      |
| 06:57      | I can just hit [[Alfred]], type in a keystroke, type in the project name and I go to that                 |
| 07:00      | project in OmniFocus.                                                                                 |
| 07:02      | It seems like a small thing, but when you spend your day opening OmniFocus, going over                |
| 07:08      | to the sidebar, clicking on the Projects tab, drilling down to the Projects tab, getting              |
| 07:13      | to the project you want.                                                                              |
| 07:14      | I mean, that is a multi-step process that takes your mind off the ball, getting back                  |
| 07:19      | to my idea of contextual computing.                                                                   |
| 07:21      | You get lost in the thread, not anymore.                                                              |
| 07:24      | You just run this thing and you're there.                                                             |
| 07:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 07:28      | Because the thing that happens to me all the time is, I'll open OmniFocus because I want              |
| 07:33      | to check what I'm doing next or add something or whatever, and then, bam, I'm sidetracked             |
| 07:39      | because I saw a shiny and there was a shiny thing there and it grabbed my attention because           |
| 07:43      | it was kind of important, and then, bam, I'm gone.                                                    |
| 07:48      | So yeah, this has been really useful for me, that and the quick open feature in OmniFocus             |
| 07:52      | itself.                                                                                               |
| 07:53      | But this way, I don't have to sort of half close my eyes when I open OmniFocus until I've             |
| 07:58      | hit the quick open.                                                                                   |
| 08:00      | I can just go for it, and that saves me a lot of time, and it's amazing how integrating               |
| 08:06      | things into the tools that we're already using for automation, even if you're only doing              |
| 08:11      | a very light usage of any of these openers can really make a difference.                              |
| 08:16      | Do you find that using the launcher approach is something that comes easy for you?                    |
| 08:22      | Yeah, because for me, I just replaced [[Spotlight]] with [[Alfred]], and I spend pretty much all day          |
| 08:30      | every day using a keyboard.                                                                           |
| 08:32      | The mouse is right there.                                                                             |
| 08:33      | I'm not going to say I don't use the mouse.                                                           |
| 08:34      | I have a very nice Razer mouse.                                                                       |
| 08:36      | It's got RGB lighting in it, which makes it extra pretty.                                             |
| 08:39      | But the reality is, I'm already on the keyboard.                                                      |
| 08:44      | So if I have to move from the keyboard to the mouse to get to an application, then that's             |
| 08:50      | going to slow me down.                                                                                |
| 08:52      | In addition to that, it's not just that, but Command Tab, it's a great invention, right?              |
| 09:00      | And then you accidentally nudge your mouse just the tiniest bit, and now your mouse is                |
| 09:03      | hovering over one of those app icons.                                                                 |
| 09:06      | Suddenly that's the one that is pecking, and that breaks my flow.                                     |
| 09:11      | So I found that by using the launcher approach to activate apps, even if they're already              |
| 09:17      | open, it's also, by the way, it's a nice hack if you've got multiple windows, because                 |
| 09:21      | it brings all of them to the front.                                                                   |
| 09:23      | So if I have, say, for example, three windows open in OmniFocus or [[Script Debugger]] or something,           |
| 09:28      | when I use [[Alfred]] to activate them, usually it ends up bringing all the windows to the                |
| 09:33      | front for me, which is just really useful when you've got like seven windows on the                   |
| 09:37      | go for some reason.                                                                                   |
| 09:39      | Yeah, I also added in one extra little example there, just because I enjoy working with voice         |
| 09:46      | so much.                                                                                              |
| 09:47      | I took one of the commands for showing the currently tasks due today, and I also showed               |
| 09:56      | how you could also trigger that using your voice as well.                                             |
| 10:00      | So you can have voice-controlled [[Alfred]] in addition to using it by the keyboard.                      |
| 10:07      | Nice.                                                                                                 |
| 10:08      | Yeah, the voice-controlled stuff is very exciting.                                                    |
| 10:11      | We're going to talk about voice-controlled, because you've done a lot on that, Sal, but               |
| 10:13      | I feel like you are single-handedly bringing voice control to another level.                          |
| 10:21      | But with respect to this OmniFocus thing, and I haven't had time to do this yet, I want               |
| 10:27      | to go through.                                                                                        |
| 10:29      | You have also made a group of 100-plus OmniFocus scripts.                                             |
| 10:34      | One of the things they did with the currently shipping versions of OmniFocus and OmniFocus            |
| 10:40      | 4, which is in the works, is they've added this robust OmniJavaScript automation engine               |
| 10:47      | and Sal's been with your knowledge of [[JavaScript]], you've been building out all these automations.     |
| 10:53      | So basically, you've added 100, I would say, features or utilities to the application.                |
| 11:00      | So if you wanted to, like I at one point asked you, can you make one that takes every active          |
| 11:06      | task and puts a deferred date to today?                                                               |
| 11:08      | Like, if I want to do that, I just push a button, Sal wrote a script for that.                        |
| 11:12      | Well, I could conceivably, using the architecture you've built here, just take that script,           |
| 11:17      | I would assume, and just build it into an [[Alfred]] command as well.                                     |
| 11:23      | Yep, absolutely.                                                                                      |
| 11:25      | And we show you how to do that.                                                                       |
| 11:26      | It's a very simple process.                                                                           |
| 11:29      | Their tool has been designed very well to work with other applications like Omni applications          |
| 11:37      | and, of course, Omni Automation, the real treasure about Omni Automation is that any                  |
| 11:45      | script can be converted into a URL that can be sent to the application and executed as                |
| 11:54      | a full, robust script.                                                                                |
| 11:57      | So it's easy to take any script that you're using and just turn it into a URL and then                |
| 12:03      | paste.                                                                                                |
| 12:05      | And you're ready to go.                                                                               |
| 12:06      | You give it your favourite [[Alfred]] Keystroke command and literally, just like Rose said,                |
| 12:14      | you pull up the launcher, type in something, and then you're gone and you go straight to              |
| 12:19      | what you need to do and you're not distracted by anything else.                                       |
| 12:23      | It just executes right into the heart of the machine.                                                 |
| 12:26      | Well, I mean, that's one of the reasons why I'm in the bag for OmniFocus.                             |
| 12:31      | When I made my big career change, I thought, well, maybe I don't need something as powerful           |
| 12:35      | as OmniFocus, and I tried some other apps, I tried to use [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]], and it's just not                |
| 12:40      | this toy set that you've built.                                                                       |
| 12:44      | How could you walk away from that?                                                                    |
| 12:46      | I mean, I can make my task manager dance for me and it gets out of my way.                            |
| 12:54      | The effect of that is I manage tasks faster and more efficiently.                                     |
| 12:59      | So why wouldn't you?                                                                                  |
| 13:01      | And I think that this move they made when you joined the team and you started adding                  |
| 13:07      | this functionality, it's just really hard to overstate.                                               |
| 13:12      | I mean, there's nothing like it out there, and now you're expanding that to the other                 |
| 13:16      | Omni Group applications, as I understand it.                                                           |
| 13:20      | And it's device-independent, which is really remarkable.                                              |
| 13:25      | So you write this script and it works the same on the iPhone and the iPad and the Mac,                |
| 13:31      | which is, you know, as an automator yourself, you don't want to have to track multiple versions       |
| 13:37      | of the same script.                                                                                   |
| 13:39      | I've heard you guys talk about that, about how, you know, Rose has some great ideas about             |
| 13:45      | how you create libraries of functions that you can update once and if everything else                 |
| 13:51      | calls that and ties into that.                                                                        |
| 13:53      | And it's nice to have that device independence and Omni has really made that a priority through       |
| 14:00      | their implementation of automation so that it makes it easy for an automator to create                |
| 14:06      | something, a tool, and then just use it everywhere and not worry about it.                            |
| 14:11      | The other nice thing I like about what you've done is you've shared everything.                       |
| 14:14      | So if you're listening and when I say [[JavaScript]], your mind gets a little foggy and you're a          |
| 14:20      | little worried about it, actually, it's a great [[JavaScript]] course, in essence, because                |
| 14:25      | you know what the script is doing, so I'll explain it, but he gives you the source right              |
| 14:30      | on the page.                                                                                          |
| 14:32      | And I am a [[JavaScript]] spelunker, if I would say, you know, if you say, sit down and write             |
| 14:38      | a [[JavaScript]] from scratch, I probably would fail.                                                     |
| 14:42      | But if you said, put a [[JavaScript]] together that does this thing, well, I've got enough                |
| 14:46      | examples of stuff, I can usually kind of cobble it together to work.                                  |
| 14:52      | And it's on my list of things to do is one day is to get much better at it.                           |
| 14:56      | But you don't give me much motivation to do that because Sal makes them and then I just               |
| 15:02      | go download them.                                                                                     |
| 15:04      | And then I learn more from them just looking at the ones you've written.                              |
| 15:07      | So I really appreciate the fact that you make it available to everyone as well.                       |
| 15:12      | So like there's a function in this one about how to get it to speak the text, because a               |
| 15:18      | lot of these scripts you've written, not only just doing you ask, but it also says,                   |
| 15:22      | hey, I'm opening the such and such project.                                                           |
| 15:25      | And now I've got this, I actually saved that snippet of [[JavaScript]] in here.                           |
| 15:29      | And I'm like, well, the next time I make one and I want to have it call out what it's doing,          |
| 15:34      | now I've got Sal's script here, I can just go ahead and make a few changes and get it                 |
| 15:38      | going.                                                                                                |
| 15:39      | So the beautiful thing about automation is not just the technology, it's the community.               |
| 15:46      | The fact that the people believe together that the more knowledge they share, the better              |
| 15:53      | it is for everybody.                                                                                  |
| 15:56      | And that's the way it should be.                                                                      |
| 15:59      | The power of the computer should reside in the hands of the one using it.                             |
| 16:04      | But at the same time, the knowledge we should be sharing with everybody instead of trying             |
| 16:09      | to hide our little bit of knowledge here or our little bit of something there, the more               |
| 16:13      | that we make automation successful, the more developers will be attracted to it, the better           |
| 16:20      | it will be for everyone.                                                                              |
| 16:22      | And that's a theme I've heard on your show many times.                                                |
| 16:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 16:26      | And I think that's true with software developers in general.                                          |
| 16:28      | They're very open about sharing code and ideas.                                                       |
| 16:31      | But the automation community brings it to another level because there's a lot of people               |
| 16:36      | in the automation community like me who are not pro developers, but they still want to                |
| 16:41      | get good enough at this stuff that they can solve their problem.                                      |
| 16:45      | They can scratch their particular itch and not every day have to spend so much time mousing           |
| 16:50      | and clicking and doing all the things that these user-friendly interfaces, they make                  |
| 16:56      | it accessible to everybody, but we want it more than just accessible.                                 |
| 17:00      | We want it fast.                                                                                      |
| 17:02      | Right.                                                                                                |
| 17:03      | And at Omni, you know, we're always looking for opportunities for interoperability.                   |
| 17:10      | It's a weird word, but it really does mean that, you know, it describes the ability                   |
| 17:16      | of software to exchange and make use of information between applications.                             |
| 17:22      | And we're always looking for opportunities.                                                           |
| 17:24      | So on the main page of the Omni Automation website, you'll see along with [[Alfred]], you'll              |
| 17:30      | see examples with [[Obsidian]], [[Airtable]], [[OpenAI]], there's a lot of examples of working with               |
| 17:37      | other third-party products.                                                                           |
| 17:41      | And that's the advantage of Omni Automation is that you have the core tools necessary                 |
| 17:46      | for doing secure communication across networks, you know, using passwords and tokens correctly,       |
| 17:54      | storing them correctly.                                                                               |
| 17:56      | All of that is built into Omni Automation.                                                            |
| 17:59      | So it's fun to come up with these connection points between software that people like to              |
| 18:05      | use and Omni products as well.                                                                        |
| 18:08      | Well, you know, now that you've raised it, I have another request.                                    |
| 18:12      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 18:13      | All right.                                                                                            |
| 18:14      | I got one for you because I've struggled with this.                                                   |
| 18:17      | I've come up with some of my own solutions.                                                           |
| 18:18      | I think Rose has even taken a crack at it, but I feel like because the Omni Group makes               |
| 18:24      | everything a URL, I think that's one of the big advantages of their software.                         |
| 18:28      | You know, like every OmniFocus project or perspective or whatever becomes a URL, I love to embed      |
| 18:34      | those URLs in other places.                                                                           |
| 18:38      | I feel like we need a better automation solution to get the URL.                                      |
| 18:41      | You know what I mean?                                                                                 |
| 18:42      | To say, create a new project and put the URL in the paste buffer for the project.                     |
| 18:47      | So then I can embed it into an [[Obsidian]] page or drop it in a craft document.                          |
| 18:52      | It's not that hard.                                                                                   |
| 18:53      | You open OmniFocus, you right-click, you copy the URL.                                                |
| 18:57      | But I have struggled over the years to come up with a reliable way to grab that URL, like             |
| 19:03      | when I created or access it.                                                                          |
| 19:06      | What would you think if I told you that we already have a plugin that does that for you?              |
| 19:10      | Of course you do.                                                                                     |
| 19:12      | I'm pretty sure this may be slightly my fault because I remember asking for this a while              |
| 19:17      | ago, say a while ago, and a very long time ago, and you just produced it in like five                 |
| 19:27      | minutes without thinking about it, which is great.                                                    |
| 19:29      | Of course you did.                                                                                    |
| 19:30      | Of course you did.                                                                                    |
| 19:31      | So all you have to do is copy the script that you want to turn into a URL to the clipboard.           |
| 19:36      | You run the plugin, and then it replaces that with a perfectly formed URL ready to go that            |
| 19:42      | you can paste.                                                                                        |
| 19:43      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 19:44      | Well, I will be following up on this.                                                                 |
| 19:45      | There's also links on the [[Alfred]] page, too, to special section and tools that we have                 |
| 19:52      | on the website that are just for creating that you can use, you can put your scripts                  |
| 19:57      | in and turn them into URLs and test them and then change them and then test them again.               |
| 20:03      | There's certain pages in the Omni Automation website that are just designed to do that                |
| 20:09      | for you, and we have links to them within the [[Alfred]] documentation.                                   |
| 20:14      | Of course you've solved the problem already.                                                          |
| 20:19      | If somebody is listening, and they're like, well, I might be a little better at [[JavaScript]]            |
| 20:23      | than Sparky, and I want to start building my own, what are some places they should                    |
| 20:28      | go to?                                                                                                |
| 20:29      | Obviously, Omni Automation is a great place to get started, but I guess this Omni flavour              |
| 20:35      | of [[JavaScript]] really is the trick for automating all of the Omni Group apps, which I'm asking         |
| 20:43      | you to agree with me.                                                                                 |
| 20:44      | Is that basically where you should start?                                                             |
| 20:47      | Yeah, the reason is because it's really based on core [[JavaScript]] with WebKit, so it's foundational.   |
| 20:55      | You're not learning special case scenarios where you have to have some library installed              |
| 21:01      | or something.                                                                                         |
| 21:02      | You're learning core [[JavaScript]], which is super well documented on the Internet.                      |
| 21:07      | We list on many of the pages resources for online training for doing basic [[JavaScript]],                |
| 21:15      | and all of your basic [[JavaScript]] functions work there.                                                |
| 21:19      | What we've done at Omni is expose all the different elements of the applications to                   |
| 21:26      | that core [[JavaScript]].                                                                                 |
| 21:29      | There's some terminology like task, project, that aren't part of [[JavaScript]], but are used             |
| 21:36      | with [[JavaScript]].                                                                                      |
| 21:37      | It's almost like an extension.                                                                        |
| 21:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 21:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 21:41      | It's all logical, and once you learn the basic principles of, okay, how do I do a loop,               |
| 21:47      | or how do I describe a property, or how do I create a [[JavaScript]] object?                              |
| 21:53      | Once you've learned the basic things from an online course, then you can quickly put                  |
| 21:59      | together these.                                                                                       |
| 22:00      | We also have tutorials.                                                                               |
| 22:02      | There's an online scripting tutorial on the [[OmniFocus]] section of the Omni Automation                 |
| 22:08      | website that will walk you through step-by-step how to do that, and how to learn it and give          |
| 22:15      | you examples.                                                                                         |

| 22:41      | I'm telling you this for your own benefit, but also for mine, because then, as you become             |
| 22:46      | the Script Master, I will also be downloading and using your scripts as well.                         |
| 22:52      | It also is me in the end.                                                                             |
| 22:53      | I am the Script Master.                                                                               |
| 22:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 22:55      | Well, that's the great thing about automation, right?                                                 |
| 22:59      | If I create something and you download it and use it, David, you're not stealing it.                  |
| 23:02      | I still get to use it, and what's more, you may look at it and go, oh, I've got a little              |
| 23:07      | idea where I can just go, ta-da, done.                                                                |
| 23:12      | That's what we need with things like this, because it actually benefits everybody.                    |
| 23:18      | There you go.                                                                                         |
| 23:19      | I constantly, I've told you guys before that a lot of my ideas, some of my ideas, come                |
| 23:26      | from what you guys say on the shows.                                                                  |
| 23:30      | You'll be talking about a problem and the way that you break into it and talk about                   |
| 23:36      | it and expose it from the user's point of view is very triggering.                                    |
| 23:41      | I can go, oh, right, I see what they're trying to do.                                                 |
| 23:44      | Well, we could probably use this to help them with that.                                              |
| 23:48      | The next thing I know, I've spent an hour working on something coming up with a solution.             |
| 23:55      | It's that approach, that inquisitive approach that you guys have that don't be afraid of              |
| 24:01      | looking into something, don't be afraid of exploring that you can do it.                              |
| 24:07      | It's part of the message that I get from the Automators podcast, and it's encouraging.                |
| 24:13      | Once you've start giving yourself the opportunity to explore, you'll find out amazing things          |
| 24:19      | and you'll be able to create tools for yourself.                                                      |
| 24:21      | Do you guys ever see that Pixar movie Ratatouille?                                                    |
| 24:26      | With a guy with a little rat in his head that would cook.                                             |
| 24:29      | The big thing was the chef said, anybody can cook, anybody can automate.                              |
| 24:35      | It doesn't take much to get started, and then once you join the community, the community              |
| 24:39      | raises you up.                                                                                        |
| 24:41      | It's really that simple.                                                                              |

| 25:00      | You've probably heard by now that you should be using a VPN when you connect to the internet,         |
| 25:04      | but adding an extra step to anything you do every day can sound like a hassle.                        |
| 25:09      | Well, if you knew how easy it is to protect your connection with ExpressVPN, you'd be                 |
| 25:13      | doing it already.                                                                                     |
| 25:15      | ExpressVPN is the easiest way to browse safely, securely, and just better.                            |
| 25:20      | I won't connect to the internet outside of my house without a VPN connection.                         |
| 25:24      | I just don't trust public Wi-Fi.                                                                      |
| 25:26      | It's too easy for the bad guys to get between you and your data and cause all sorts of bad            |
| 25:31      | things to happen.                                                                                     |
| 25:32      | ExpressVPN gets rid of all those things you hate about VPNs, and it's a VPN done right.               |
| 25:37      | First of all, it's blazing fast.                                                                      |
| 25:40      | Lots of other VPNs slow your connection to the point where it's not even worth it to                  |
| 25:44      | connect, but ExpressVPN doesn't lag or buffer.                                                        |
| 25:47      | You can stream in HD with no issues.                                                                  |
| 25:50      | And using it couldn't be easier.                                                                      |
| 25:52      | Just open the ExpressVPN app, click one button, and enjoy instant protection across all your          |
| 25:57      | devices.                                                                                              |
| 25:58      | The fact is, once you connect to ExpressVPN, you don't even realise you have it on.                   |
| 26:02      | But your connection is secure, your data is encrypted, and you can spoof your location                |
| 26:07      | so you can have access to content available outside your region.                                      |
| 26:11      | No wonder it's been called the best VPN by CNET.                                                      |

| 26:41      | Sal, you mentioned in the last segment, window management, which got my ears to perk up,              |
| 26:47      | because this is something I've never talked to you about.                                             |
| 26:49      | And for a guy like you who can write [[AppleScript]] and [[JavaScript]] and just knows Automation            |
| 26:56      | inside out on your Mac, do you use any automation with your window management?                        |
| 27:02      | After certain situations, yes.                                                                        |
| 27:06      | Quite often would write those myself.                                                                 |
| 27:09      | If I was dealing with applications that were scriptable, a lot of them had just by enabling           |
| 27:18      | Apple events, it automatically exposed the window classes so you could size and scale                 |
| 27:23      | them to where you wanted it to be.                                                                    |
| 27:26      | And so a lot of the times I'm focusing on certain applications and I would need a certain             |
| 27:31      | window setup.                                                                                         |
| 27:33      | So long before there was [[Moom]] or third-party tools for that, I would write scripts that               |
| 27:39      | would set up windows a certain way, just so I knew I had to do something like 100 times.              |
| 27:46      | For example, I quite often worked with other groups at [[Apple]] and one of the groups I worked           |
| 27:52      | with was Retail.                                                                                      |
| 27:54      | And Retail was always up against the wall deadline-wise.                                              |
| 27:58      | They had to produce everything that they did in 14 languages and had to be done yesterday.            |
| 28:06      | And they always would come to me for automation resources and answers.                                |
| 28:13      | And a lot of times I found that what they were doing was transferring data between applications,      |
| 28:20      | but they needed some visual control over it.                                                          |
| 28:23      | And so having windows side by side became a very viable solution.                                     |
| 28:28      | So I started developing some window management tools to do that.                                      |
| 28:33      | And it's quite helpful just to be able to hit a script and it goes, and you instantly                 |
| 28:39      | have everything that you need in place, ready to go, you do it, you run another script and            |
| 28:46      | it goes away.                                                                                         |
| 28:47      | So that's always been part of it.                                                                     |
| 28:49      | As a matter of fact, when we created folder actions, way back on Mac OS 8.5, one of the               |
| 29:01      | examples we added was that when you opened a folder, it could automatically size the                  |
| 29:07      | windows and tile them.                                                                                |
| 29:09      | For all the windows that were part of that folder would tile into a row right behind                  |
| 29:16      | them, offset slightly.                                                                                |
| 29:18      | And if you moved one of them, the folder action would drag the other windows along with it.           |
| 29:25      | And that's built into, it's still there today, it's built into the operating system of folder         |
| 29:30      | actions.                                                                                              |
| 29:31      | I'm going to have to dig that out.                                                                    |
| 29:32      | I didn't know that that was there, but yeah, that was one of the first examples.                      |
| 29:36      | And that's used, and that is using an [[AppleScript]] underneath the, how is it resizing                 |
| 29:40      | the windows?                                                                                          |
| 29:41      | Well, what it does is when the finder would trigger the folder action event, it would                 |
| 29:48      | pass the window object to the script that gets called.                                                |
| 29:54      | And the script would say, okay, what are the current bounds of this main window?                      |
| 29:58      | Do you have any windows that belong to this main window?                                              |
| 30:02      | We'll tile them and offset them one, so many 24 pixels offset north and south or whatever             |
| 30:10      | it was, and just line them up.                                                                        |
| 30:12      | And it became quite useful, so you could drag whole sets of windows around and then close             |
| 30:20      | one and it would close them all.                                                                      |
| 30:23      | Folder actions was quite inventive and innovative.                                                    |
| 30:29      | Nobody had done anything like that.                                                                   |
| 30:30      | And I feel like folder actions are still a really powerful automation tool that a lot                 |
| 30:35      | of people don't use.                                                                                  |
| 30:37      | I feel like it just never landed for whatever reason, so the idea of it is you trigger an             |
| 30:44      | automation by doing something with the folder.                                                        |
| 30:47      | So if you want to rename a file, you drag it on the folder and it renames the file.                   |
| 30:53      | Or it's lots of normal file management stuff is really good with folder actions.                      |
| 31:00      | The original folder actions was triggered when you open or close a folder.                            |
| 31:07      | When you add something or take something away from a folder, each one of those events triggered       |
| 31:14      | an attached script, a folder action.                                                                  |
| 31:18      | And so when you move the window of the folder, that also triggered an apple of it or an attached      |
| 31:26      | script.                                                                                               |
| 31:27      | It attached scripts to different folders.                                                             |
| 31:31      | And one of the first things you want to do is, if you want to harass somebody, you attach             |
| 31:36      | a script to their folder so that when they open it, it closes immediately.                            |
| 31:40      | Did you ever do that to anybody?                                                                      |
| 31:44      | Oh, I'm not going to claim that one, but...                                                           |
| 31:49      | This may have been done and you may have witnessed it happening.                                      |
| 31:50      | It may have been done.                                                                                |
| 31:51      | There might have been people mad at me for that one, but we figured that many people                  |
| 31:55      | were going to abuse that and a lot of people didn't even know it was there.                           |
| 32:01      | You could also...                                                                                     |
| 32:03      | We had ones where when you open a folder, it would change the background picture inside               |
| 32:09      | the folder and start playing ambient music.                                                           |
| 32:13      | So on Halloween, we had a script that was often passed around the shop where you open                 |
| 32:20      | a folder and this creepy picture of a forest would become the background of the folder                |
| 32:25      | and you'd start hearing spooky music on your machine.                                                 |
| 32:30      | That was popular.                                                                                     |
| 32:31      | That is...                                                                                            |
| 32:32      | When you think about it, it is useful though.                                                         |
| 32:35      | I am a big fan of what I call contextual computing.                                                   |
| 32:38      | I feel like one of the best ways to use a computer is to have it help you speed your                  |
| 32:45      | way through doing things without getting distracted.                                                  |
| 32:48      | So much of technology is about distraction, but I never thought about contextually setting            |
| 32:53      | folder backgrounds to the type of work you're doing.                                                  |
| 32:56      | If I have the folder where I manage the Automator's podcast files, we're going to finish recording    |
| 33:01      | today.                                                                                                |
| 33:02      | I'm going to have a folder with files.                                                                |
| 33:03      | What if I made the background red?                                                                    |
| 33:06      | The Automator's kind of red and then now I know exactly which folder I'm in and I don't               |
| 33:11      | drag the file from the wrong folder.                                                                  |
| 33:14      | The Mac Power use is green, Automator's is red.                                                       |
| 33:16      | I know exactly which one I'm in and using automation to set that up.                                  |
| 33:21      | I think that's something I wanted to explore further, maybe the next time you're on, we'll            |
| 33:26      | have you.                                                                                             |
| 33:27      | But I just love Window Automation as an automation tool and kind of a gateway drug for people         |
| 33:32      | because I think for so many people, if you could just say, hey, automation, they say,                 |
| 33:37      | well, what good is automation?                                                                        |
| 33:39      | I say, well, what if every time you wanted to write the sales report, you clicked a button            |
| 33:43      | on your Mac and it opened up the folder with the previous sales report and it opened up               |
| 33:47      | pages where you write the sales report and it opened up the website where you research                |
| 33:51      | it and it organised it on your desk so everything was just ready and you could start working.         |
| 33:57      | That is something absolutely doable with multiple automation platforms.                               |
| 34:03      | You were there ahead of your time, buddy.                                                             |
| 34:07      | And one of the, I don't know if all the folder actions are still implemented or not in the            |
| 34:12      | operating system.                                                                                     |
| 34:13      | I haven't looked.                                                                                     |
| 34:14      | One of my favourite tricks was I had a script attachment that would look for an alias file             |
| 34:20      | in the folder and if the alias file was there, it would open it up.                                   |
| 34:26      | So at the top level of the folder, if I dragged an alias to a document I was working on into          |
| 34:31      | that folder, when I opened the folder, it would also open that document.                              |
| 34:36      | And if I wanted to stop doing that, I would just get rid of the alias file that was in                |
| 34:41      | the folder.                                                                                           |
| 34:42      | Clever.                                                                                               |
| 34:43      | That's clever.                                                                                        |
| 34:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 34:45      | There's all kinds of things you can do with automation.                                               |
| 34:47      | It's like you guys said, it's, you know, if there's all these different possibilities                 |
| 34:51      | and they're all waiting there for you to explore.                                                     |
| 34:55      | Makes a lot of sense.                                                                                 |
| 34:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 34:57      | Do you use any of the modern window management tools?                                                 |
| 35:00      | So I know that like you could just put together an [[AppleScript]] that you mentioned, [[Moom]],             |
| 35:06      | a [[Keyboard Maestro]] does window management.                                                            |
| 35:08      | Do you use any of those tools for it or do you just write a script?                                   |
| 35:11      | Pretty much the latest thing I'm doing is web apps.                                                   |
| 35:16      | You know, since I'm using the beta here too, like you guys are using the beta, one of the             |
| 35:21      | features of it is that you can convert a website into a web app and it becomes this little            |
| 35:28      | self-contained entity that makes it easy to use and track.                                            |
| 35:33      | So all of the windows that you open up inside that web apps, if they're in the same domain            |
| 35:39      | will stay in that little bundle and I've been using that, you know, as making these little            |
| 35:46      | worlds that I explore, rather than doing window management, I find that that's pretty helpful         |
| 35:55      | because it's easy to tab between different windows and I like that feature.                           |
| 36:03      | It seems to work very well.                                                                           |
| 36:04      | As a matter of fact, I put a manifest file into Omni-Automation to try it out.                        |
| 36:10      | So both Omni-Automation and the Omni-Automation voice control websites have manifest files            |
| 36:18      | that can become self-contained web app entities using the new beta operating system.                  |
| 36:26      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by TextExpander.                                          |

| 36:36      | client and you don't want to track down the same FAQs from the company website again and              |
| 36:40      | again and again.                                                                                      |

| 37:05      | You just build and collect your most commonly used phrases, messages, URLs and more right             |
| 37:09      | within TextExpander, then create your chosen abbreviation and they'll be with you or                   |
| 37:12      | a view type.                                                                                          |
| 37:13      | You can even customise the snippets by having them automatically add in dates, fill in the            |
| 37:17      | blank fields, timestamps and more.                                                                    |

| 37:22      | TextExpander is available on any device you use, across any app you use on Mac, Windows,               |
| 37:27      | Chrome and iOS.                                                                                       |
| 37:28      | I use TextExpander for all sorts of things, like making sure that I insert the correct                 |
| 37:31      | email address that I've typed my name correctly, or most recently, as I realised, spelling            |
| 37:36      | the word separate correctly, E's and A's apparently in my brain are just interchangeable.             |
| 37:42      | When I'm not creating super simple snippets like that, which quite frankly do save my                 |
| 37:45      | bacon, I am using the more advanced options, such as scripting inside of snippets so that             |

| 38:06      | So, you teased us a little bit earlier with voice control, and for folks who are going                |
| 38:13      | with voice control, think of it like, hey, [[Apple]] lady, but considerably more useful.                  |
| 38:22      | Not to bash Siri, but the number of times I hear, particularly my parents talking to                  |
| 38:27      | her, and she's like, I found some results on the web for you, and it is just kind of                  |
| 38:33      | amazing that they actually seem perfectly happy with this.                                            |
| 38:37      | I don't know what's going on there, but voice control of your computer can allow way more             |
| 38:44      | things.                                                                                               |
| 38:45      | There's a number of accessibility benefits, of course, for folks who have low or no vision            |
| 38:50      | so that they can work around the screen and things like that, and all of that's something             |
| 38:56      | that hopefully every app is going to work on and have.                                                |
| 39:00      | But voice control of the Omni apps is something that you have just gone hardcore implementing          |
| 39:08      | or extending with the automation APIs, and seeing what you're doing is kind of crazy.                 |
| 39:13      | I've actually found a couple of new features in particularly OmniFocus, or it's made something        |
| 39:19      | click in my brain as to how something works, it's like, oh, that's how I do that thing                |
| 39:23      | when I've been looking at this.                                                                       |
| 39:24      | But how did you get started on this?                                                                  |
| 39:27      | Where did this come from?                                                                             |
| 39:28      | Was it an idea because of accessibility reasons or something else?                                    |
| 39:34      | It just seemed to me when I was working on automation at [[Apple]] that I was always looking              |
| 39:42      | for ways for it to connect into the operating system and work with other apps.                        |
| 39:47      | And then there was this whole text of speech and speech recognition thing that was going              |
| 39:54      | on.                                                                                                   |
| 39:55      | And those teams, for some reason, I was attracted to working with them and combining automation       |
| 40:02      | and voice together.                                                                                   |
| 40:05      | And I always worked with those teams very closely.                                                    |
| 40:09      | And when the Siri team showed up, I also worked with them, and we had really tight integration        |
| 40:15      | with automation in Siri at 1.2.                                                                       |
| 40:18      | But when you start looking at the voice technologies on the computer and how they're used, voice      |
| 40:25      | control is quite unique in that it offers so many different ways of integration.                      |
| 40:34      | A lot of people don't realise that all of the things that you can do with voice control,              |
| 40:44      | for example, I can make a voice control command that is triggered by a phrase or some kind            |
| 40:51      | of word order that I say that will open a file, paste text, paste data, open a URL,                   |
| 41:00      | select a menu, press a keyboard shortcut, or run a shortcut shortcut.                                 |
| 41:07      | All of that is possible just by triggering with your voice.                                           |
| 41:12      | And one of the things I noticed right away is with Omni Automation having the ability                 |
| 41:17      | to convert any script into a URL.                                                                     |
| 41:21      | That means just opening a URL now becomes full execution of an Omni Automation script.                |
| 41:28      | And the two just lend themselves perfectly to working together.                                       |
| 41:32      | And the more I got into working with voice, the more I understood, I better understood                |
| 41:39      | its role and how you use it on a practical level.                                                     |
| 41:45      | The main thing I found out and discovered was that you don't use it to control everything.            |
| 41:51      | You use it for those to trigger automations in the scenarios where your hands are busy.               |
| 41:58      | So if I already have my hands on the mouse and I'm doing something, but I need to go                  |
| 42:02      | get a file or mount a server or do something with the data that's on the clipboard, something         |
| 42:09      | that would take me away from what I'm doing, that's perfect for voice triggering.                     |
| 42:15      | So I could just have something on the clipboard and go convert that to decimal, boof, done,           |
| 42:22      | and then paste.                                                                                       |
| 42:23      | So that's using voice.                                                                                |
| 42:26      | How you use it is really the key to making it part of your productivity.                              |
| 42:34      | It's designed so that you can do everything with it, so that you can really, if you need              |
| 42:40      | to rely on it, you can.                                                                               |
| 42:42      | But that's not my goal with it.                                                                       |
| 42:44      | My goal in particularly was using it as an adjunct to the automations that I do.                      |
| 42:52      | And it is perfectly designed to do that.                                                              |
| 42:56      | And that's one of the powers of voice control.                                                        |
| 42:59      | And that's what attracted me to it.                                                                   |
| 43:02      | I think one of the challenges with voice control for people listening is it can feel intrusive        |
| 43:09      | when you turn it on, like when you turn on voice control because it's an accessibility                |
| 43:12      | feature.                                                                                              |
| 43:13      | It is, you know, that lady plus, really.                                                              |
| 43:17      | And it puts a little box on your screen with a microphone that tells you that whether it's            |
| 43:22      | hot or not.                                                                                           |
| 43:23      | And you suddenly you've got that.                                                                     |
| 43:26      | That's changing.                                                                                      |
| 43:27      | Oh, is that?                                                                                          |
| 43:28      | That's changing.                                                                                      |
| 43:29      | If you've looked at the new beta, turn it on in the new beta.                                         |
| 43:32      | They're not using the microphone box.                                                                 |
| 43:34      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 43:35      | Well, see, I don't record the podcast on the beta.                                                    |
| 43:38      | I'll have to look.                                                                                    |
| 43:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 43:40      | It's a separate machine.                                                                              |
| 43:41      | But all right.                                                                                        |
| 43:42      | Well, that, well, that solves that problem.                                                           |
| 43:43      | But the, the other thing.                                                                             |
| 43:44      | Plus they have a nice training app in the new beta.                                                   |
| 43:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 43:48      | It will, you open up the app and it walks you through everything like learning the tech               |
| 43:52      | suite, learning window navigation, learning all kinds of different stuff.                             |
| 43:58      | And it's really well done.                                                                            |
| 44:00      | And it's quite informative.                                                                           |
| 44:01      | I mean, you, you sit there and spend 10 minutes with this little training app and you're ready        |
| 44:06      | to go.                                                                                                |
| 44:07      | It's very, very good.                                                                                 |
| 44:08      | I played with it when it first got added to the operating system and eventually turned                |
| 44:12      | it off because it just didn't feel like, it felt like it was too much of a project when               |
| 44:17      | I, when I used it, but then when you started building all these tools, I re-enabled them              |
| 44:22      | last year and I've never turned it off.                                                               |
| 44:25      | And the, the point I was going to make is that not only do you get a way to automate                  |
| 44:29      | your apps, you get a much improved voice to text dictation.                                           |
| 44:33      | And I know that Siri has got better this year.                                                        |
| 44:37      | They're using a, a transformer model, I believe, and they've, they've made significant improvement    |
| 44:42      | to the text to the voice to text engine.                                                              |
| 44:46      | In fact, would you guys agree?                                                                        |
| 44:47      | I mean, I feel like it's a lot better now that I've been using it on the betas.                       |
| 44:51      | I know that's not what we're here to talk about today, but it's.                                      |
| 44:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 44:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 44:56      | No, it's definitely improved significantly.                                                           |
| 44:57      | And the nice thing about voice control, it's not server oriented, you know, service, the              |
| 45:03      | [[Apple]] lady as Rose calls her, you know, it's connected to a server.                                   |
| 45:07      | You have to have an internet connection.                                                              |
| 45:10      | And a lot of times she'll say, Oh, I can't do that for you.                                           |
| 45:14      | I'll, I'll send a notice to your phone or something.                                                  |
| 45:17      | But voice controls all self-contained on, on the computer.                                            |
| 45:21      | And you can pretty much do anything with the computer through your voice with voice control.          |
| 45:27      | You can tap a specific area of the screen.                                                            |
| 45:29      | You can do drags.                                                                                     |
| 45:31      | You can dictate.                                                                                      |
| 45:33      | You can be in the middle of typing and then dictate.                                                  |
| 45:36      | It's all, it's, it's pretty amazing.                                                                  |
| 45:39      | And the tools that we designed using voice control for OmniFocus, you know, the over 100              |
| 45:47      | different commands, when we design those, we thought about how they would be an adjunct.              |
| 45:53      | So although you, we provided a voice commands file for enabling every menu and on the Mac             |
| 46:02      | OmniFocus so that you can call any menu that you want.                                                |
| 46:06      | We also designed the specialised tools as being an adjunct.                                           |
| 46:11      | So one of the things I noticed I was like, okay, I need to make a repeating task on Wednesday.        |
| 46:19      | So I would just say repeating task for Wednesday and it could get me started.                         |
| 46:25      | It would take me right into the task, have it already set up to repeat, and then I could              |
| 46:31      | fill in the details that I wanted to, you know, just being able to narrow down and get                |
| 46:37      | to that one little bit of thing quicker is very, very helpful.                                        |
| 46:42      | And it's a perfect thing for voice.                                                                   |
| 46:44      | You know, you just basically talking to it and telling what you want, and it sets it                  |
| 46:50      | up for you to go to work.                                                                             |
| 46:52      | And that's where it's really helpful.                                                                 |
| 46:54      | So on the Omni Automation website, there's a section for voice control.                               |
| 47:01      | And within that, there's a section for OmniFocus with over 120 examples, I believe, that you          |
| 47:10      | can download and install because voice control files can be installed through these little            |
| 47:17      | P-list files that you can install right in the voice control system preferences.                      |
| 47:24      | And it will bring in everything that you need.                                                        |
| 47:26      | You don't have to do anything other than just go import.                                              |
| 47:29      | It imports the command, sets up the language, sets up the actions, everything for you.                |
| 47:35      | So you can control pretty much everything OmniFocus does using that custom set of commands            |
| 47:43      | very quickly.                                                                                         |
| 47:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 47:45      | And if you're going to dictate with voice control, it's so much better than the [[Apple]]                 |
| 47:48      | Lady because you can add a custom dictionary as well.                                                 |
| 47:52      | So if you've got proper nouns or words that the built-in transcription chokes on, you                 |
| 47:58      | just add them to your vocabulary and off to the races you go.                                         |
| 48:03      | It's just such an eye-opener.                                                                         |
| 48:06      | Not only can I use the stuff you built to control my app, but also I've got better dictation.         |
| 48:11      | And as soon as we finish recording, I'm going to go over to my beta machine and see what              |
| 48:15      | they've done on the new one because I feel like this is something a lot of people are                 |
| 48:20      | missing out on.                                                                                       |
| 48:21      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                             |
| 48:23      | It's unfortunately, David, you mentioned that it's an accessibility feature.                          |
| 48:30      | And yes, it performs great value and offers great value for the accessibility community.              |
| 48:37      | Yes, it does.                                                                                         |
| 48:39      | But at the same time, a lot of people don't pay attention to it because they think, well,             |
| 48:44      | I don't need that.                                                                                    |
| 48:46      | And what it really is, it's another input and control device for the computer in the                  |
| 48:53      | same way that a keyboard is.                                                                          |
| 48:55      | The voice, you have this voice that is sitting there waiting to be used.                              |
| 49:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 49:01      | It's almost like solar panels.                                                                        |
| 49:04      | The sun's there.                                                                                      |
| 49:06      | It's waiting to be used.                                                                              |
| 49:08      | And all you have to do is put up these solar panels and you can take advantage of it.                 |
| 49:13      | Well, there's this whole level of automation and ability built into every [[Apple]] device                |
| 49:20      | that's just waiting for you to use.                                                                   |
| 49:22      | So instead of trying to remember a keyboard shortcut or trying to remember what do I have             |
| 49:28      | to do first or click or what, you can just give it a phrase and have it be there for                  |
| 49:35      | you when you need it.                                                                                 |
| 49:38      | I'm thinking myself, as we get these more sophisticated devices, that you're going to                 |
| 49:46      | be wanting to type less, maybe dictate more, and also maybe use that extra voice assistant            |
| 49:55      | more rather than having to interact through the keyboard, mouse, and standard typing ways.            |
| 50:03      | I think that voice is going to become more prominent and more important in our computing              |
| 50:09      | lives moving forward.                                                                                 |
| 50:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 50:11      | I feel like it feels natural with this [[artificial intelligence]] boom, right?                           |
| 50:16      | Like, it's more conversational.                                                                       |
| 50:19      | The automation should match it with conversational input.                                             |
| 50:23      | And I do feel like there's something to that.                                                         |
| 50:26      | Absolutely.                                                                                           |
| 50:27      | I know we had plans for the show.                                                                     |
| 50:31      | I gotta ask you, are you looking at all at [[ChatGPT]] and [[Large Language Model\|LLMs]] and thinking about automation               |
| 50:38      | with those types of technologies?                                                                     |
| 50:40      | Well, that comes under interoperability.                                                              |
| 50:45      | And like I said, one of the sections we have on the website is for open AI.                           |
| 50:53      | And we have examples there about how to interact with an open AI server.                              |
| 51:01      | Not all of them are, you know, we're not interacting with the chat GPT-4, we're using                 |
| 51:07      | some of the other services that they offer about data and images and things like that.                |
| 51:13      | And there's examples like you're in [[OmniGraffle]] and you say, I want a picture of a sailboat           |
| 51:19      | on a column day in blue water.                                                                        |
| 51:21      | Oof.                                                                                                 |
| 51:22      | And it puts it right there on the canvas for you.                                                     |
| 51:25      | Or you say, I want a colour palette for an autumn day.                                                 |
| 51:31      | And instantly you'll get all these little boxes of different colours labeled and added                 |
| 51:37      | to your document.                                                                                     |
| 51:39      | You know, there's examples that we have for creating outlines, like give me a basic outline           |
| 51:46      | on the steps we'll need to adapt more renewable resources and it will generate an outline             |
| 51:54      | for you in OmniOutliner.                                                                              |
| 51:57      | So we have some examples there of how one would tie into an AI source using authentication            |
| 52:05      | and credentials and then have it actually do something within the document.                           |
| 52:11      | So we have examples there and it comes under the heading of interoperability, where we're             |
| 52:16      | not, you know, recommending or the third party tool, but we're showing you how to use that            |
| 52:23      | if that's what you want to do.                                                                        |
| 52:26      | And that makes a lot of sense.                                                                        |
| 52:27      | I can't help but feel there is something here as an automation enthusiast that this is                |
| 52:33      | going to open a whole new avenue into automation for people.                                          |
| 52:38      | And it's something that we need to be thinking about, you know, like how do we figure out             |
| 52:42      | a way to implement that in a way that makes sense and is ethical and but at the same time             |
| 52:48      | gives people less friction between the thing they want to do with their computer and their            |
| 52:54      | computer.                                                                                             |
| 52:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 52:56      | I think I'm excited by the possibility of where, for example, you know, your company                  |
| 53:03      | might have a set of data that it uses in its business and that there would be an open,                |
| 53:10      | there would be some kind of AI tool that you could point to your own data and create a                |
| 53:16      | intelligence model for that.                                                                          |
| 53:19      | And then that would give your employees a way to talk into your data and extract the                  |
| 53:24      | best out of it easily.                                                                                |
| 53:27      | And once you can do that, then it can be automated.                                                   |
| 53:30      | And then, you know, I'm excited by that possibility of, you know, focused use of AI seems like        |
| 53:39      | it's a very valuable thing and it can make it a lot easier for people.                                |
| 53:43      | And the key there is your data, right?                                                                |
| 53:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 53:46      | Like look at my calendar and look at OmniFocus and look at the number of times I've deferred          |
| 53:51      | this task and decide for me if it's really that important and look at what I'm spending               |
| 53:56      | my time on and like come up with me, give me a proposed plan for the week to work on                  |
| 54:01      | my most important work.                                                                               |
| 54:03      | Like, you know, I feel like that's something that AI can bring us without having to stick             |
| 54:10      | our data on the cloud, right?                                                                         |
| 54:11      | To be able to help us plan our days and take the grunt work out of it and allow us to make            |
| 54:18      | the things that are important and not be managers but makers.                                         |
| 54:22      | And that's keeping your data, your data.                                                              |
| 54:25      | Exactly.                                                                                              |
| 54:26      | That's the stuff that gets me excited.                                                                |
| 54:27      | Like become my smart assistant and do this for me.                                                    |
| 54:31      | And I feel like it's not that far off, right?                                                         |
| 54:34      | I mean, we hope not, right?                                                                           |
| 54:38      | Pretty soon, they'll be telling you, David, sit down.                                                 |
| 54:39      | I got this.                                                                                           |
| 54:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 54:41      | Well, you know, if it's grunt work, I hope it does.                                                   |
| 54:44      | Like, you know, I don't want to do the donkey work.                                                   |
| 54:46      | You know, I want to be making stuff.                                                                  |
| 54:48      | I don't want to be dealing with, you know, the nonsense.                                              |
| 54:51      | And so...                                                                                             |
| 54:52      | Well, we're definitely getting closer.                                                                |
| 54:54      | You know, when I first started working at [[Apple]], I literally lived across the street                  |
| 55:00      | from [[Apple]].                                                                                           |
| 55:01      | And I would basically go into work and every night they had a library over in Building 4.             |
| 55:09      | They had all of these videos of every [[WWDC]] session.                                                   |
| 55:16      | And they also had the Knowledge Navigator video, the famous Knowledge Navigator video.                |
| 55:22      | And I would go in there around midnight when nobody else was around.                                  |
| 55:25      | And I would start by watching the Knowledge Navigator video.                                          |
| 55:29      | And then I would pick some area and watch as many videos as I could stand of that particular          |
| 55:35      | area of knowledge, right?                                                                             |
| 55:38      | And that really got me thinking about how all the technologies should work together to                |
| 55:45      | really expose a personal level of assistance that was both informative, inquisitive, but              |
| 55:53      | not in your face.                                                                                     |
| 55:56      | And that pretty much outlined it.                                                                     |
| 55:57      | And I always kept trying to replicate those concepts by implementing automation with speech,          |
| 56:04      | speech recognition, the other technologies in the operating system.                                   |
| 56:10      | And then once we got [[AppleScript]] Objective C, the doors opened up and we could talk to               |
| 56:16      | any of the Cocoa APIs.                                                                                |
| 56:19      | It got very, very powerful and that became more reality.                                              |
| 56:23      | And that's really where we should be going.                                                           |
| 56:26      | In the future, I think you're right, David, you're going to have built into your computer             |
| 56:31      | a level of intelligence that you could turn on and say, observe what I do and give me                 |
| 56:37      | a summary or a synopsis of what do you think would be improvement?                                    |
| 56:42      | And let me see that.                                                                                  |
| 56:43      | What would that be?                                                                                   |
| 56:45      | And those will be the kind of tools that will be offered.                                             |
| 56:48      | And I think it would fit within [[Apple|Apple's]] scope because they're very concerned about protecting         |
| 56:54      | your data and making it your data.                                                                    |
| 56:58      | And that would work if you could get the AI tool to work with what you have and help you              |
| 57:05      | do it better than that.                                                                               |
| 57:07      | That's interesting.                                                                                   |
| 57:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 57:09      | It gets me excited just thinking about it, like I feel like in my lifetime, this is going             |
| 57:14      | to be a thing and it's going to be a disruptor, but it's also going to allow you to do better         |
| 57:19      | work.                                                                                                 |
| 57:22      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 57:23      | This episode of The Automators is brought to you by Taskbone.                                         |
| 57:27      | Get more out of your productivity tools and get special onboarding support for a limited              |
| 57:31      | time only.                                                                                            |
| 57:32      | Let's go to Taskbone.com/Automators.                                                            |
| 57:36      | Listeners of this show know that we often talk about automations for task management                  |
| 57:40      | or project templates, mainly talking about the task management software we are using.                 |
| 57:45      | But there's another level to this.                                                                    |
| 57:47      | Like maybe you're using [[Todoist]], like Dominic, the founder of Taskbone.                               |
| 57:50      | And if you are, you should check out their [[Todoist]] extension because Taskbone adds support            |
| 57:55      | for Taskpaper templates.                                                                             |
| 57:57      | Using Taskbone, you can outline your project using plain text bullet points and Taskbone              |
| 58:02      | will create the project's tasks and subtasks for you.                                                 |
| 58:06      | And you can use that simple Taskpaper notation to assign labels, due dates, and priorities.          |
| 58:12      | Anybody listening to my voice can figure out Taskpaper annotation.                                   |
| 58:15      | It's not hard.                                                                                        |
| 58:17      | And with Taskbone, you can just drop that straight into Todoist.                                      |
| 58:20      | Because it's all about automation, you can even include variables, loops, if-else statements,         |
| 58:25      | and date calculations in your template.                                                               |
| 58:28      | You can also export your projects into various plain text formats like Task Paper, Todo.txt,          |
| 58:34      | or Markdown.                                                                                          |
| 58:35      | Plus customisable templates for exports and exports based on custom filters will be available         |
| 58:40      | soon.                                                                                                 |
| 58:41      | Do you use [[Obsidian]]?                                                                                  |
| 58:43      | Taskbone's got a plug-in for that, too, that allows a convenient two-way sync between your            |
| 58:47      | local Markdown files and [[Todoist]].                                                                     |
| 58:50      | At Taskbone, they understand that adding a new service to your automation tool belt may               |
| 58:53      | come with a learning curve.                                                                           |
| 58:55      | And who's got time for that?                                                                          |

| 59:13      | I spent some time working with Taskbone.                                                              |
| 59:15      | It really does take this automation to the next level.                                                |

| 01:00:01   | One last time, gang, Taskbone.com/Automators.                                                   |
| 01:00:05   | Sal, the reason I actually asked you on wasn't all this cool stuff, but we continue to get            |
| 01:00:13   | people asking us about [[AppleScript]].                                                                  |
| 01:00:15   | And you know, it's [[AppleScript]] is, well, I'm going to let you explain what it is.                    |
| 01:00:21   | We've talked about it.                                                                                |
| 01:00:22   | I think a lot of listeners know, but I'd like to hear it from you.                                    |
| 01:00:25   | And people are, there's two questions we get.                                                         |
| 01:00:28   | Number one, should I learn [[AppleScript]]?                                                              |
| 01:00:31   | And the implicit question there is, look, it just works on the Mac.                                   |
| 01:00:34   | It doesn't work on the iPhone and iPad.                                                               |
| 01:00:36   | Should I be spending my time in [[JavaScript]] instead?                                                   |
| 01:00:38   | That's the first question we get.                                                                     |
| 01:00:39   | And the second question is, how do I learn [[AppleScript]]?                                              |
| 01:00:43   | And Rose and I give advice, but I'm like, you know, there was a guy in charge of this                 |
| 01:00:47   | at [[Apple]] who would come on the show and talk to people.                                               |
| 01:00:50   | Maybe we should ask him, you know, and check that video link.                                         |
| 01:00:55   | Just take a second and open that up.                                                                  |
| 01:00:57   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:58   | So he sent us a video link that is at the intro seminar to [[AppleScript]] from [[Apple]].                   |
| 01:01:03   | We're going to put a link in the show notes for everybody.                                            |
| 01:01:06   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:01:07   | Take a look at that.                                                                                  |
| 01:01:09   | And that whole approach, the thing about [[AppleScript]] that is so wonderful, it's like the             |
| 01:01:17   | people's automation language, right?                                                                  |
| 01:01:19   | And engineers hated it because it was so verbose and so flexible and it wasn't typed.                 |
| 01:01:28   | It wasn't like, okay, document dot dot dot dot dot colon slash slash, you know, it was                |
| 01:01:34   | like there was no particular order.                                                                   |
| 01:01:36   | It had a natural language syntax that you could invert and put the verb over here and                 |
| 01:01:41   | this there and, you know, and it was just so incredibly powerful.                                     |
| 01:01:45   | But people liked it because it was the duct tape.                                                     |
| 01:01:48   | It was the glue between their ideas.                                                                  |
| 01:01:53   | And because it's so profoundly addresses that, it's lasted over 25 years now.                         |
| 01:02:01   | I mean, there's a reason why.                                                                         |
| 01:02:05   | It's because it does what you need to do.                                                             |
| 01:02:08   | And even if you just learn it for the Mac, it's worthwhile because you'll be learning                 |
| 01:02:13   | concepts that are pertinent regardless of what language you eventually use.                           |
| 01:02:21   | All languages share certain concepts.                                                                 |
| 01:02:24   | For example, one of the most important concepts is about objects that in [[AppleScript]], everything     |
| 01:02:30   | is thought of as an object.                                                                           |
| 01:02:33   | And objects have properties.                                                                          |
| 01:02:35   | And just like us, right?                                                                              |
| 01:02:37   | I have a name, I have a height, I have a position, I have a location.                                 |
| 01:02:42   | All of those properties have values.                                                                  |
| 01:02:47   | And the first thing that you do with [[AppleScript]] is you learn how to manipulate the                  |
| 01:02:50   | value of properties of the objects.                                                                   |
| 01:02:54   | So that file in a folder has a location.                                                              |
| 01:02:58   | If you open it up, there's a word and a paragraph, which is part of a story.                          |
| 01:03:04   | All of those kind of things and those concepts that you learn about [[AppleScript]] are pertinent        |
| 01:03:08   | to learning other languages anyway.                                                                   |
| 01:03:12   | And you'll also find that [[AppleScript]] has some pretty darn unique things called who's                |
| 01:03:18   | clauses that make writing scripts a lot easier than having to learn how to do repeats and             |
| 01:03:27   | all kinds of other heavy-duty things.                                                                 |
| 01:03:31   | For example, when the next folks came into [[Apple]] and it was determined that we were going             |
| 01:03:43   | to keep [[AppleScript]] after a while, there was a little struggle over that, but they                   |
| 01:03:48   | wanted to know about it.                                                                              |
| 01:03:49   | So Chris Espinoza and myself, we met with some of the folks from the next platform and                |
| 01:03:57   | talked to them about [[AppleScript]].                                                                    |
| 01:03:59   | And they said, okay, can you write an example on the board?                                           |
| 01:04:02   | And I think we wrote something like, tell application finder to duplicate every document              |
| 01:04:08   | file of the entire contents of the startup disk whose name contains Smith project to                  |
| 01:04:14   | the folder name backup.                                                                               |
| 01:04:16   | Right?                                                                                                |
| 01:04:17   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:04:18   | So it's a long one-liner, but it's a one-liner.                                                       |
| 01:04:21   | But it's a one-liner.                                                                                 |
| 01:04:22   | We wrote it on the whiteboard and then sat down and they went, no, no, no, no, we need                |
| 01:04:26   | to see the code and we pointed to the thing because, no, you don't understand.                        |
| 01:04:31   | We need to see the code for doing this.                                                               |
| 01:04:34   | We understand what you want to do, but where's the code?                                              |
| 01:04:37   | And we pointed to the thing and they went, what?                                                      |
| 01:04:40   | And I said that.                                                                                      |
| 01:04:42   | And then they turned and looked at each other and talked to little computerese for a second.          |
| 01:04:48   | And then went, oh, okay, it fit in really well with Objective-C and the concept of objects            |
| 01:04:53   | and everything else.                                                                                  |
| 01:04:54   | It was just super high level, way up here, you know, where it had been extracted.                     |
| 01:05:00   | But once they got the concept and bringing it across was okay.                                        |
| 01:05:05   | And that's the beauty of [[AppleScript]] is that it just works.                                          |
| 01:05:11   | And sometimes the implementation in some apps might be dingy, some, you know, a developer             |
| 01:05:17   | might not implement it correctly, and then that's a pain that you have to like try to                 |
| 01:05:22   | work around, but you use the David Sparks approach at that point where you look for                   |
| 01:05:27   | previously done examples and find somebody else that already figured it out.                          |
| 01:05:32   | Yeah, somebody that already went through the pain and you just copy it and then you're                |
| 01:05:35   | off to the races.                                                                                     |
| 01:05:37   | And there's great communities around that too.                                                        |
| 01:05:40   | The folks at [[Script Debugger]], they have a community and there's a bunch of online scripting communities |
| 01:05:45   | where you can go and have people give you examples of how to do the common things you                 |
| 01:05:52   | want to do.                                                                                           |
| 01:05:53   | Yeah, and, you know, when you talked about how some developer people don't like [[AppleScript]],                 |
| 01:05:57   | see, I am the flip side of that coin.                                                         |
| 01:06:00   | Like, to me, I look at [[JavaScript]] and I have to really parse it because there's a bunch               |
| 01:06:06   | of periods and brackets and all this stuff.                                                           |
| 01:06:09   | And I know that if I get any of that wrong, it all breaks.                                            |
| 01:06:12   | And I grew up using [[AppleScript]], you know, at your knee.                                             |
| 01:06:16   | And so I, it's like [[AppleScript]] is so easy and forgiving that I'm like, what's wrong                 |
| 01:06:22   | with all these other computer languages that they make it so like, you know, it's like,               |
| 01:06:27   | there's tripwires on every line.                                                                      |
| 01:06:29   | And if you just make one little mistake, the whole thing blows up and like [[AppleScript]]               |
| 01:06:34   | is so forgiving.                                                                                      |
| 01:06:35   | So I feel like it's a great forgiving language to start with.                                         |
| 01:06:39   | The other thing I would add to what you just said is for a lot of stuff on the Mac, it's              |
| 01:06:44   | the only way.                                                                                         |
| 01:06:45   | It's just, it's the only way because these Mac developers, the good ones put in Apple                 |
| 01:06:51   | Script dictionaries in their apps where there's a bunch of stuff you can do almost anything           |
| 01:06:55   | in their app with automation just by going to the dictionary.                                         |
| 01:06:58   | That's where I would make the pitch to go by script debugger if you want to do this                   |
| 01:07:02   | because they, their dictionaries are good.                                                            |
| 01:07:05   | Yes, absolutely.                                                                                      |
| 01:07:07   | And if you check out the, I think you're going to put a link to the, the training video that          |
| 01:07:13   | I recorded.                                                                                           |
| 01:07:15   | Yep.                                                                                                  |
| 01:07:16   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:07:17   | So I did a video, an introductory to [[AppleScript]] video about 45 minutes for [[Apple]] and                |
| 01:07:23   | it's still valid and all the concepts there are once you get a start understanding the                |
| 01:07:29   | concept and you look at going into dictionaries and how to see what is available to you and           |
| 01:07:36   | how to put the pieces together.                                                                       |
| 01:07:39   | Once you get that, then you can really be productive with [[AppleScript]].                               |
| 01:07:43   | There are so many apps that do have [[AppleScript]] support.                                             |
| 01:07:48   | Like you said, and once you start having that ability to write the basic scripts, you're              |
| 01:07:54   | off to the races.                                                                                     |
| 01:07:55   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:07:56   | It's not that hard, honestly.                                                                         |
| 01:07:58   | I mean, I would argue the even [[JavaScript]] and some of the more complex stuff is not that              |
| 01:08:02   | hard if you've got good examples, but [[AppleScript]] in particular is not that hard.                    |
| 01:08:07   | The other advantage of [[AppleScript]] is it's been around so long that you are one Google               |
| 01:08:12   | search away from an answer of almost anything.                                                        |
| 01:08:15   | Yep.                                                                                                  |
| 01:08:17   | And if you do need a book while I was at [[Apple]], it took me five years to write the book.              |
| 01:08:23   | I wrote a book, [[AppleScript]] one, two, three with Bill Cheeseman.                                     |
| 01:08:30   | And we pretty much covered the [[AppleScript]] from A to Z on that thing.                                |
| 01:08:35   | It was difficult to write that book because [[AppleScript]] was changing while I was writing             |
| 01:08:40   | the book.                                                                                             |
| 01:08:41   | But we finally got it done and approved and through all the [[Apple]] bureaucracy and the                 |
| 01:08:47   | book is still, the electronic version is still for sale at the Apple iBook Store, AppleScript 1-2-3        |
| 01:08:54   | I don't get, just a side note, I don't get any money from that.                                       |
| 01:08:57   | [[Apple]] took all the money.                                                                             |
| 01:08:59   | But my picture is on the book.                                                                        |
| 01:09:01   | So I do get whatever that value is.                                                                   |
| 01:09:04   | I mean, you get it.                                                                                   |
| 01:09:05   | I've got a very handsome picture of you on my shelf here, you know, on that book.                     |
| 01:09:10   | Yep.                                                                                                  |
| 01:09:11   | Yep.                                                                                                  |
| 01:09:12   | It only gets better with time.                                                                        |
| 01:09:13   | I don't actually move and watch you.                                                                  |
| 01:09:16   | That's just how the iBook Store makes it look.                                                        |
| 01:09:19   | Yep.                                                                                                  |
| 01:09:20   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:09:21   | That is a really handy book.                                                                          |
| 01:09:22   | And it's one of those things folks might be going, oh, you know, computer science programming         |
| 01:09:26   | language.                                                                                             |
| 01:09:27   | And I hear that if it, you know, if it wasn't written in the last like month, you don't               |
| 01:09:30   | want to pick it up.                                                                                   |
| 01:09:31   | In the case of [[AppleScript]], it's not that it's a dead language.                                      |
| 01:09:34   | It's that it is such a stable language.                                                               |
| 01:09:37   | It's more like Icelandic if we were comparing it with human languages, where Icelandic basically      |
| 01:09:43   | hasn't changed in a very long time.                                                                   |
| 01:09:45   | I was reading something the other day and apparently most people in Iceland are able                  |
| 01:09:49   | to read things from the 10th century because their language just hasn't changed that much.            |
| 01:09:54   | It's evolved and they've added to it.                                                                 |
| 01:09:56   | You know, the core foundation of it hasn't gone away and, you know, and it's still very               |
| 01:10:02   | much the same and [[AppleScript]] is, you know, the same.                                                |
| 01:10:05   | It's the foundation of it has stayed the same the way it works to stay the same, you know,            |
| 01:10:09   | you can still use who's or where in and there's a bunch of synonyms for stuff as well.                |
| 01:10:15   | So if your brain decides that it likes one word better than another word for it and that's            |
| 01:10:20   | the synonym, then you can just go ahead and use it.                                                   |
| 01:10:23   | And [[Apple]] appears to be committed to keeping it updated.                                              |
| 01:10:26   | They're not like adding new features, but, you know, they're fixing bugs on it, so it's               |
| 01:10:33   | still viable.                                                                                         |
| 01:10:34   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:10:35   | That's another when I get people say, well, should I learn is [[Apple]] going to dump it at               |
| 01:10:39   | some point because they've moved on the shortcuts and my response usually tell me if I'm wrong,       |
| 01:10:44   | I feel like it would be more work for them to try to remove it than to keep it.                       |
| 01:10:49   | And, you know, and, and, you know, people use this stuff.                                             |
| 01:10:53   | I mean, one of the interesting stories, I heard this about you, Sal, not from you, but                |
| 01:10:58   | somebody told me once that, you know, back in the battle days of the mid nineties, when               |
| 01:11:04   | [[Apple]] was on the ropes, the that what happened, you know, they weren't selling many computers,        |
| 01:11:14   | but the computers they were selling were to publishing houses and people that were using              |
| 01:11:18   | Macs and they had all built out [[AppleScript]], automations and complex automations to keep             |
| 01:11:25   | their, their publishing pipeline going.                                                               |
| 01:11:27   | And they were reliant on [[Apple]] for that.                                                              |
| 01:11:29   | And that is what kept the company on life support until kind of the big change.                       |
| 01:11:33   | Now, somebody told me this once, you can tell me, in fact, we can cut this out if I can't             |
| 01:11:38   | say this, but the Steve Jobs said once, Sal's the guy that kept it, kept the lights on.               |
| 01:11:43   | Is that true?                                                                                         |
| 01:11:44   | I don't know if Steve said that, but I was definitely out there pushing, especially with              |
| 01:11:52   | the publishing world, they were heavily invested in [[AppleScript]].                                     |
| 01:11:56   | I mean, all the way up to the New York Times stock pages, the weather pages for the Chronicle.        |
| 01:12:02   | I mean, it was everywhere and it still is quite highly used in all forms of media production.         |
| 01:12:10   | Well, and so my point is, for the people writing me saying, well, I'm worried about                   |
| 01:12:14   | all your [[AppleScript]] that they're going to take it out.                                              |
| 01:12:17   | A lot of those publishing houses are still using this stuff, you know, [[Apple]] still uses               |
| 01:12:21   | it.                                                                                                   |
| 01:12:22   | Everybody's using this underlying script.                                                             |
| 01:12:24   | So I feel like if the name broke, don't fix it.                                                       |
| 01:12:27   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:12:28   | You're fine.                                                                                          |
| 01:12:29   | You're fine learning [[AppleScript]].                                                                    |
| 01:12:30   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:12:31   | Maybe if you want to extend out into other platforms, it's a launching point to something             |
| 01:12:35   | like [[JavaScript]].                                                                                      |
| 01:12:36   | But I can tell you personally, I do a lot of my most important work on the Mac and there's            |
| 01:12:41   | a bunch of stuff I've automated over the years that I just can't do on a mobile device with,          |
| 01:12:49   | but I can do it with [[AppleScript]] on the Mac.                                                         |
| 01:12:51   | A good example for me is at the [[Apple Mail]] app.                                                       |
| 01:12:53   | I wrote a script that parses the first name out of the recipient, like, you know, so it's             |
| 01:13:00   | just a quick little script.                                                                           |
| 01:13:01   | I think it's like two or three lines, but it reliably gives me, if I write an email to                |
| 01:13:06   | sell and then I go into the body of the email and I trigger the script, it says sell, it              |
| 01:13:13   | puts his name in.                                                                                     |
| 01:13:14   | So then I put that into a TextExpander, snip it.                                                     |
| 01:13:17   | So I just say X high and it says high sell.                                                           |
| 01:13:20   | And I can't build that in [[Apple Mail]] on the iPhone because it doesn't have [[AppleScript]]               |
| 01:13:27   | and there's no way to do it with [[JavaScript]] because they don't give me enough access,                 |
| 01:13:31   | blah, blah, blah, blah.                                                                               |
| 01:13:33   | But I can do that and I can do it on the platform that I use the most because of [[AppleScript]].        |
| 01:13:40   | It's quite viable and I still use it.                                                                 |
| 01:13:43   | It's a prime automation tool for me.                                                                  |
| 01:13:46   | I use it to create other automations.                                                                 |
| 01:13:49   | And a lot of the times, you know, the examples that I put on Omni Automation are all done             |
| 01:13:55   | with [[AppleScript]] generating the [[JavaScript]].                                                          |
| 01:13:59   | How do you do that?                                                                                   |
| 01:14:02   | I use [[BBEdit]], which is a remarkable tool if you have to deal with text.                              |
| 01:14:08   | I've heard Rose mentioned that app on show many times.                                                |
| 01:14:12   | It's extremely powerful and useful.                                                                   |
| 01:14:15   | And I have [[BBEdit]] automated that I can take any Omni Automation script and convert it                |
| 01:14:21   | into the HTML using [[AppleScript]] and it just generates it like instant for me.                        |
| 01:14:28   | It saves me tremendous amount of work.                                                                |
| 01:14:31   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:32   | It is incredibly useful.                                                                              |
| 01:14:33   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:34   | I'd never really thought of that like, you know, taking an [[AppleScript]] and converting                |
| 01:14:38   | it to [[JavaScript]] because my [[JavaScript]] knowledge is too weak, but having an automated process         |
| 01:14:45   | that's very attractive to me, that idea.                                                              |
| 01:14:48   | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:49   | Well, I think we've made the case for [[AppleScript]] guys.                                              |
| 01:14:51   | What do you think?                                                                                    |
| 01:14:52   | I think so.                                                                                           |
| 01:14:55   | Mission succeeded.                                                                                    |
| 01:14:56   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:57   | So we're going to put some links in the show.                                                         |
| 01:15:01   | The video that Sal was talking about, the tutorial is going to be there as well and the link          |
| 01:15:06   | to [[AppleScript]] one, two, three.                                                                      |
| 01:15:09   | And the other thing I'm going to add is a link to the app script debugger.                            |
| 01:15:14   | Now [[Apple]] has a free scripting app that you get with your Mac and it does a decent job                |
| 01:15:18   | of [[AppleScript]].                                                                                      |
| 01:15:19   | The script debugger, I think you explained it to me one day is the [[AppleScript]] app [[Apple]]             |
| 01:15:25   | should have made.                                                                                     |
| 01:15:26   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:15:27   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:15:28   | It's much more powerful.                                                                              |
| 01:15:29   | And if you want to, if you want to spend any time making [[AppleScript]], just spend the                 |
| 01:15:33   | money and buy script debugger.                                                                        |
| 01:15:35   | And the thing personally that I would recommend it for is I talked earlier about these dictionaries   |
| 01:15:42   | where every app has its own dictionary.                                                               |
| 01:15:45   | I feel like script debugger does such a better job of discovering and exploring, explaining           |
| 01:15:50   | the dictionaries than [[Apple]] does.                                                                     |
| 01:15:52   | And that is where you're going to get lost.                                                           |
| 01:15:54   | That's the stuff that's going to hit you when you're trying to figure it out.                         |
| 01:15:57   | And if you have an app that does a better job of it for you, it's going to save you                   |
| 01:16:00   | a ton of time.                                                                                        |
| 01:16:02   | Script debugger is a must, must, must.                                                                |
| 01:16:05   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:16:06   | I'm also going to throw out a recommendation for [[FastScripts]].                                        |
| 01:16:10   | So obviously if you're using Omni Automation or something, then you'll have the automation            |
| 01:16:15   | menu inside of that app.                                                                              |
| 01:16:17   | But if, for example, like me, you may use something like iTerm, which has [[AppleScript]]                |
| 01:16:21   | support, it's got very good [[AppleScript]] support, but it doesn't have a way in there                  |
| 01:16:27   | to necessarily run the script in the manner that I would like, then you can use [[FastScripts]]          |
| 01:16:33   | to put any script, and I mean any script in your menu bar, and you can have them be application       |
| 01:16:40   | specific as well.                                                                                     |
| 01:16:41   | So they can show up, for example, when you're in DEVONthink or when you're in Mail and so             |
| 01:16:45   | on and so forth.                                                                                      |
| 01:16:46   | So [[FastScripts]] is definitely something that I would recommend folks check out.                       |
| 01:16:51   | You can download the free version from Red Sweater Software.                                          |
| 01:16:53   | We've had Daniel on the show before.                                                                  |
| 01:16:55   | There is an upgrade to a pro version, which unlocks even more features, which I feel like             |
| 01:17:02   | I never scratch the surface off, but it's well worth it regardless because it just makes              |
| 01:17:06   | it so easy to run [[AppleScript]] or any other script.                                                   |
| 01:17:09   | And of course, with all these scripts, go steal what sales are already written.                       |
| 01:17:14   | Or somebody.                                                                                          |
| 01:17:15   | I mean, there's just so much of it out there.                                                         |
| 01:17:16   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:17:17   | On that general theme, if you're listening and you've created an interesting [[AppleScript]]             |
| 01:17:21   | to solve an interesting problem, let us know because we do these feedback shows once in               |
| 01:17:25   | a while.                                                                                              |
| 01:17:26   | I'd love to share some of the work that our listeners have done because there's a lot                 |
| 01:17:31   | of people listening to this show that are pretty good automators.                                     |
| 01:17:34   | So we'd love to hear what you're doing with [[AppleScript]] and kind of share the love.                  |
| 01:17:38   | All right.                                                                                            |
| 01:17:40   | Well, I think that's going to wrap it up.                                                             |
| 01:17:42   | So Sal, we've got links in for Omni Automation and Omni Voice Control.                                |
| 01:17:47   | We're going to have some links to all the stuff we just talked about [[AppleScript]].                    |
| 01:17:50   | Where else should people go if they want to keep up with what you're doing?                           |
| 01:17:53   | In fact, let's share your music.                                                                      |
| 01:17:56   | Oh, I'm using a wonderful service called Sound Slice.                                                 |
| 01:18:02   | That's two words, Sound Slice, but it's one word as URL, soundslice.com.                              |
| 01:18:09   | And I have a little corner of Sound Slice where I post arrangements that I'm working                  |
| 01:18:16   | on and recordings, those kinds of things.                                                             |
| 01:18:20   | And I'll be posting some new stuff with my [[MIDI]] guitar up there fairly soon as well.                  |
| 01:18:25   | I really enjoy the quality of their tools.                                                            |
| 01:18:29   | And it's an entire community with people sharing ideas.                                               |
| 01:18:33   | You can, there's also instruction.                                                                    |
| 01:18:36   | If you want to learn a particular style or something about music, there's usually somebody            |
| 01:18:42   | there that teaches a course and you can get the course there online as well.                          |
| 01:18:47   | It's a wonderful resource, soundslice.com.                                                            |
| 01:18:51   | And I'll give you the link to my little corner.                                                       |
| 01:18:54   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:18:55   | Sal, for folks that don't know, is a guitarist, a jazz guitarist of the First Order.                  |
| 01:18:59   | And it's great.                                                                                       |
| 01:19:01   | And I can't wait to see what you are.                                                                 |
| 01:19:03   | Well, I mean, you know, you are, I mean, it's very impressive as a jazz guy, I love losing            |
| 01:19:11   | to your music.                                                                                        |
| 01:19:12   | But anyway, we'll put a link to that in the show notes as well.                                       |
| 01:19:14   | We are the Automators podcast.                                                                        |
