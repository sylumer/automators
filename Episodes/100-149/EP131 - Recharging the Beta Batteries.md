| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators, the podcast about making sure that all of your devices                |
| 00:06      | do all of your things for you automatically, so you actually maybe have a little less work              |
| 00:11      | to do in your life.                                                                                     |
| 00:12      | My name is Rosemary Orchard, and I'm joined as always by David Sparks.                                    |
| 00:16      | Hey, David, how are you?                                                                                |
| 00:17      | I am great, Rose, super happy to talk to you.                                                           |
| 00:20      | We are actually recording this, I think like three weeks after the last episodes, we both               |
| 00:25      | have been mech-deep in betas, but Rose has been doing some fun things, so we haven't                    |
| 00:30      | had our usual kind of like offline conversation, so I am on the edge of my seat.                        |
| 00:35      | I want to hear how this stuff is working for you.                                                       |
| 00:38      | I have thoughts, you have thoughts.                                                                     |
| 00:39      | It's time to talk about these betas.                                                                    |
| 00:42      | Yeah, it is, and I went hardcore testing the betas just because I could.                                |
| 00:49      | I went to Glastonbury Festival where there's no signal, there's no Wi-Fi, there's no power.             |
| 00:55      | And I used my phone, and I was there with an act who was actually performing the Circus                 |
| 01:01      | Big Top, so I was there a bit longer than most people, I've been camping essentially                    |
| 01:05      | in a field for a week with a solar power battery pack, so I could recharge my battery pack              |
| 01:10      | in the sun, which worked pretty well, and I'm pleased to report, David, I did not run                   |
| 01:16      | out of battery for an entire week in camping.                                                           |
| 01:18      | I was really, really proud of myself.                                                                   |
| 01:20      | We can't just leave it at that.                                                                         |
| 01:22      | So you had no power and you did everything solar?                                                       |
| 01:26      | I mean, I had multiple battery packs with me, which I did end up using in the end, but                  |
| 01:31      | I had a solar-powered battery pack as well, which has a little solar panel in the front                 |
| 01:35      | of it, but a single small solar panel size of a battery pack is not going to do a lot.                  |
| 01:39      | So this one had a magnetic clip-on, which folded out like another three solar panels,                   |
| 01:44      | which was pretty good.                                                                                  |
| 01:46      | So yeah, I've been solar-powered for a week.                                                            |
| 01:48      | What was the brand on it?                                                                               |
| 01:50      | I will find a link, if I can, from [[Amazon]] and pop it in the show notes.                                 |
| 01:56      | It's just one I picked up that I spotted.                                                               |
| 02:00      | It's not anything particularly amazing.                                                                 |
| 02:04      | It is a kind of like leave it out in front of your tent all day to repower this 75% of                  |
| 02:09      | the way job.                                                                                            |
| 02:11      | So yeah, it's not perfect, but at the same time, it worked.                                             |
| 02:14      | It got me through a festival, so I'm pretty pleased with that.                                          |
| 02:17      | Now, did you leave the solar panel out during the day?                                                  |
| 02:21      | So you were camping.                                                                                    |
| 02:22      | Was it out of a tent or...?                                                                             |
| 02:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 02:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 02:26      | Okay, so you would leave the tent and just leave the solar charging, and then you'd come                |
| 02:29      | back and you'd swap batteries or plug overnight or whatever.                                            |
| 02:33      | Yeah, so I tended not to charge my phone overnight.                                                     |
| 02:36      | I'd plug my phone in when I was inside or something, and most of the time, just kind                    |
| 02:42      | of leave the battery pack out charging in front of the tent while we were back at the                   |
| 02:47      | tent or similar, because people need time to change and get into costume and makeup                     |
| 02:52      | and stuff.                                                                                              |
| 02:53      | So there was time to sit around and not do anything with that in the sun, which was                     |
| 02:57      | quite good.                                                                                             |
| 02:58      | But yeah, sometimes I just left it all in the tent or just in front of the tent out                     |
| 03:02      | of the way, and it recharged just fine.                                                                 |
| 03:04      | And as I understand it, you guys have generally had a pretty sunny time over there in UK recently,      |
| 03:10      | but I know it's a big country, so I don't want to presume that it's been pretty hot                     |
| 03:13      | over there.                                                                                             |
| 03:14      | Yeah, it's been pretty sunny.                                                                           |
| 03:17      | That said, there has been a reasonable amount of cloud coverage as well, unfortunately not              |
| 03:22      | quite enough for me yesterday, so I ended up a little bit pink.                                         |
| 03:26      | But you know what, I'm okay.                                                                            |
| 03:28      | I should have reapplied my Factor 50 again, but aside from that, it's been pretty sunny,                |
| 03:34      | which has helped recharge it.                                                                           |
| 03:35      | But I have to say, if you've got large enough solar panels, you don't need perfectly sunny              |
| 03:40      | weather.                                                                                                |
| 03:41      | You can get away with cloudier weather or slightly overcast.                                            |
| 03:44      | You don't want dark and gloomy.                                                                         |
| 03:45      | It's not going to work, but yeah, slightly cloudy is fine.                                              |
| 03:50      | Yeah, my earthquake pack is a jackery battery that would charge my phone for two or three               |
| 03:59      | weeks, I think.                                                                                         |
| 04:00      | It's got a lot of power in it, but I keep that charged regularly.                                       |
| 04:05      | But they make a custom solar panel to go with it, it's $300, and I just can't get myself                |
| 04:12      | to buy it.                                                                                              |
| 04:13      | It's like, that's a lot of money, but if we had an earthquake here, and I had power                     |
| 04:18      | loss for more than three or four days, I'd feel really dumb for not having bought it.                   |
| 04:24      | Well, maybe you won't feel that dumb, David, because recently, as in the week before I                  |
| 04:31      | went, Anker launched a new Solix range, so LIX, where they're doing solar panels and                    |
| 04:38      | battery pack combinations, and they're using a newer technology than the jackery battery                |
| 04:43      | packs, so that may well be worth looking into their portable power station and solar panel              |
| 04:48      | combinations.                                                                                           |
| 04:49      | Oh, I didn't even know that, well, there you go.                                                        |
| 04:52      | So we already are costing myself and other people plenty.                                               |
| 04:56      | Well, that's life.                                                                                      |
| 04:59      | Is my loyalty towards Anker justified?                                                                  |
| 05:01      | I feel like when they make stuff, I usually just buy their thing, because it just feels                 |
| 05:05      | like I've never had a problem.                                                                          |
| 05:07      | What's your take on Anker?                                                                              |
| 05:09      | I mean, personally, I find Anker stuff is great.                                                        |
| 05:14      | It works, it's reliable if there is a problem with it for some reason.                                  |
| 05:20      | They're pretty good about sorting it out, and you can get it through [[Amazon]].                            |
| 05:25      | They tend not necessarily to have the best in class of things, but they're also pretty                  |
| 05:29      | quick onto the market.                                                                                  |
| 05:31      | So whenever, for example, the [[MagSafe]] stuff came out, they came out with their MagGo line               |
| 05:37      | very quickly after [[MagSafe]] launched.                                                                    |
| 05:40      | So you didn't have to buy [[Apple|Apple's]] [[MagSafe]] battery pack, you could buy the Anker MagGo,                  |
| 05:44      | which is something like three times the capacity and only slightly larger.                              |
| 05:50      | And so, yeah, I personally think the Anker is great.                                                    |
| 05:53      | I also like the fact that they do different colour options and so on, which is just nice                 |
| 05:57      | to have for this sort of thing.                                                                         |
| 06:01      | But yeah, there are other options out there, which may be better or best in class, but                  |
| 06:08      | Anker is just always a reliable go-to.                                                                  |
| 06:11      | Yeah, and if I'm looking at it right, the solar stuff from Anker is not inexpensive either.             |
| 06:16      | I think there's just the stuff costs, like there are 625 solar panels, $330.                            |
| 06:23      | But it's not a bad idea as we're dealing with different weather conditions, not to have                 |
| 06:30      | something set aside.                                                                                    |
| 06:31      | I know that's not totally automated talk, but it always comes up and I feel like we                     |
| 06:39      | should cover it either way.                                                                             |
| 06:41      | So we did get down a little rabbit hole there, but sorry for that, my fault.                            |
| 06:45      | But let's talk about these betas.                                                                       |
| 06:47      | What have you got installed where?                                                                      |
| 06:49      | Okay, so I have the beta installed on my iPhone and my iPad Pro, my [[Apple Watch]], and a Spare            |
| 06:59      | at MacBook Pro.                                                                                         |
| 07:00      | Now I've barely been at home in the last two weeks, so I was able to install Sonoma on                  |
| 07:06      | my MacBook Pro and go, cool, that boots, that works, hey, shortcuts are here, my shortcuts              |
| 07:12      | are syncing, shortcuts appear to run, and that's kind of as far as I got with Mac OS.                   |
| 07:18      | But the iPad and iPhone I had some more time with, I didn't take the iPad Pro with me for               |
| 07:24      | the last week.                                                                                          |
| 07:25      | I've had many just I wanted to have a little bit more reliability, so not running a beta                |
| 07:32      | and potentially battery life is always a concern when you're running a developer beta, so having        |
| 07:38      | something that would stay connected to the internet because it didn't just overheat itself              |
| 07:43      | and run out of battery was definitely a priority there.                                                 |
| 07:46      | But I'm pleased to say that my [[Apple Watch#Apple Watch Ultra\|Apple Watch Ultra]] has been working really well on the                    |
| 07:51      | beta and that battery life has not been terrible on it.                                                 |
| 07:55      | So I've tried Loot Power Mode and having the Always On Display off and things like that                 |
| 08:02      | as well to test that out, and everything seems to be working pretty well.                               |
| 08:06      | What have you got in store where?                                                                       |
| 08:08      | All the things, all the places, I go crazy with betas every year.                                       |
| 08:14      | My production machine, which has changed since the last time you and I talked, Rose, I'm                |
| 08:20      | a brand new Mac Studio right here.                                                                      |
| 08:22      | Nice.                                                                                                   |
| 08:23      | My Mac Studio is talking to Rosemary Orchard for the first time as we record this.                      |
| 08:28      | But yeah, that's cool, and that is still on Ventura, but the laptop is on Sonoma.                       |
| 08:35      | The carry phone is on the new beta, the iPad is on the new beta, all the stuff is on the                |
| 08:42      | beta.                                                                                                   |
| 08:43      | I have one iPad that is on the old operating system because I'm doing some screen casting               |
| 08:48      | projects where I need to have that, but otherwise, I'm all in, baby, and generally having a good        |
| 08:55      | time, we're going to talk during the show about a few hiccups I've seen with automation                 |
| 09:01      | during the betas, and we're very early in the beta period, I'm not recommending that                    |
| 09:04      | everybody else do what I did, but it's not too bad.                                                     |
| 09:08      | My biggest problem is sometimes shortcuts don't want to run on the Mac, and they've                     |
| 09:15      | been working since the beta 2 came out, but I haven't been spending enough time in it to                |
| 09:20      | say for sure that whatever was going on got fixed.                                                      |
| 09:23      | But it's nice, it's a pretty stable year.                                                               |
| 09:28      | The battery life thing is absolutely true, it's true every year with the betas.                         |
| 09:33      | It's always shocking to me when we get to September or late August and they start dialing               |
| 09:40      | in the battery stuff for the final release, and suddenly the battery gets so much better                |
| 09:45      | and everything.                                                                                         |
| 09:46      | It's like there's just a dial they can turn when they want, but right now I suspect the                 |
| 09:51      | phone's doing a lot of reporting to [[Apple]] as it's getting crashes or whatever, and that                 |
| 09:56      | really sucks down the battery.                                                                          |
| 09:58      | Yeah, it does, and just like things are sucking down the battery, the devices are also heating          |
| 10:03      | up as well.                                                                                             |
| 10:04      | I've been taking advantage of my Razer Chroma Cooler, so it's a little sort of [[MagSafe]] fan              |
| 10:11      | that you can stick on the back of your phone, it doesn't charge it, it's just a fan, but                |
| 10:15      | it essentially cools your phone down, and I've definitely been taking advantage of that                 |
| 10:20      | to be able to actually cool my phone down so that then it's not been super hot, especially              |
| 10:26      | as I've been outside so much, I've really wanted to avoid my phone overheating.                         |
| 10:30      | So yeah, it's definitely been quite warm and the battery hasn't been the best, but that                 |
| 10:36      | is to be expected.                                                                                      |
| 10:37      | This is the price you pay on a developer beta, all of the diagnostics and reporting back                |
| 10:41      | to [[Apple]] are completely necessary so that they actually know what's going wrong.                        |
| 10:45      | But that said, I've had very few crashes so far.                                                        |
| 10:50      | I have had crashes, I have a weird bug in messages where I'll type a message to somebody                |
| 10:57      | or I'll try and start replying to a message to somebody and I'll get a keyboard, but then               |
| 11:01      | the message bar is hidden underneath the keyboard or something, so I can't actually                     |
| 11:05      | see what I've typed and I have to go out of the message and then back into it, at which                 |
| 11:08      | point it magically reappears, but pretty much all of the things I've run into have been                 |
| 11:14      | usable.                                                                                                 |
| 11:15      | Yeah, that keyboard one I've experienced too since day one with the beta, I think that's                |
| 11:19      | just something they haven't sorted out yet, but it's easily fixable.                                    |
| 11:24      | Just close the app and reopen and you're good.                                                          |
| 11:26      | I do think that this has been a pretty stable year.                                                     |
| 11:30      | I can't help but feel like [[Apple]] has done so much work over the years on the underlying                 |
| 11:36      | stuff that now it seems like they're not doing as much of that and as a result, things are              |
| 11:41      | more stable.                                                                                            |
| 11:42      | Now they're doing more close to the surface changes with these betas and that makes it                  |
| 11:47      | a lot easier.                                                                                           |
| 11:48      | Yeah, yeah, it definitely does.                                                                         |
| 11:50      | I want to note before we move on this whole thing, you have a refrigeration unit for                    |
| 11:55      | your phone.                                                                                             |
| 11:56      | I didn't even know there was such a thing, Razer phone cooler.                                          |
| 12:00      | Yeah, yeah, I didn't know this was a thing either until I was on the Razer website and                  |
| 12:08      | so a friend recommended Razer mice to me, so I have a Razer Basilisk mouse, which is great                |
| 12:13      | because it's got loads of buttons on it.                                                                |
| 12:15      | It's got a little charging dock that it sort of magnetises onto you to charge, which is                 |
| 12:20      | what has the dongle and so it'll work even when the mech has been asleep because as most                |
| 12:26      | folks will know, Bluetooth devices won't work when your mech has actually been powered                  |
| 12:33      | off to input a password or something.                                                                   |
| 12:37      | You'll have to use either an [[Apple]] magic keyboard or a physically USB connected keyboard                |
| 12:44      | or a keyboard or mouse connected by a dongle.                                                           |
| 12:49      | The dongle Razer Basilisk mouse is great for that, but I was looking at that and then                   |
| 12:56      | I think I needed free shipping or I was looking to get free shipping because I found their              |
| 13:00      | Snakey Snek, which is their adorable cuddly mascot designed by one of their folks who was              |
| 13:07      | off on parental leave as like a snake for the kids, basically trying to explain what                    |
| 13:14      | Mom or Dad doesn't work, I guess, and I wanted the Snakey Snek because it's adorable and               |
| 13:19      | snuggly and was looking at it and was like, wait, they do a cooler for your phone?                      |
| 13:26      | Huh, that's interesting and thought I'll buy it and try it and it's come in handy a couple              |
| 13:32      | of times.                                                                                               |
| 13:33      | You know, like when you're restoring to a new phone, the one of the things that really                  |
| 13:36      | slows down a restore is the fact that your phone gets warm and if you keep your phone                   |
| 13:41      | cool, then it will restore a lot faster.                                                                |
| 13:44      | So by having the cooler, it actually allows you to restore your device faster if you need               |
| 13:50      | to.                                                                                                     |
| 13:51      | And also every so often, you know, your phone will just get warm for whatever reason, maybe             |
| 13:54      | it's been sitting in the sun, maybe it's trying to upload 693 pictures that you took over               |
| 13:59      | the last week to iCloud Photos, whatever it is, and being able to just slap this on the                 |
| 14:06      | back and have it cool as it does whatever its thing is, is pretty nice.                                 |
| 14:10      | Well, I do think if you're going to be on the beta as plan on carrying a battery with                   |
| 14:14      | you or a solar charger or an iPhone air conditioner or all of the above, yeah, maybe we need to         |
| 14:21      | make a beta hat and it's like a cap you put on, but it's got a big solar panel like on                  |
| 14:26      | top of it, like, like one of those mortar boards.                                                       |
| 14:28      | It's going to have to be a really big solar panel to actually be effective.                             |
| 14:31      | Yeah, that's the only problem.                                                                          |
| 14:33      | Well, then maybe a beta jacket and it's a jacket made entirely of solar panels.                         |
| 14:37      | Just think about it.                                                                                    |
| 14:38      | A beta backpack sounds better to be honest.                                                             |
| 14:41      | Yeah, of course, Rose comes in with the right idea, a backpack, but either way, yeah, make              |
| 14:45      | sure you carry a battery with you and don't put it on your phone if you need it to make                 |
| 14:50      | your living yada, yada, yada, even though I did.                                                        |
| 14:53      | Do as I say, not as I do.                                                                               |
| 14:55      | Yes, yes, exactly.                                                                                      |
| 14:57      | So we're in these betas.                                                                                |
| 14:59      | Let's start with shortcuts.                                                                             |
| 15:00      | How's it going?                                                                                         |
| 15:02      | What's working and not working for you?                                                                 |
| 15:04      | So I did have some issues with shortcuts to start with shortcuts on my phone was just                   |
| 15:09      | crashing.                                                                                               |
| 15:10      | And thanks to a lovely listener of iOS today, I was able to track it down to the great app              |
| 15:17      | SOFA.                                                                                                   |
| 15:18      | Now, to be clear, this is not the SOFA developer's fault.                                               |
| 15:21      | This is a weird thing that somehow just shortcuts broke when this app was installed.                    |
| 15:28      | And the new beta that came out the end of last week has fixed this.                                     |
| 15:32      | So it's the beta that came out like a week, 10 days ago, if you're listening to this                    |
| 15:36      | episode, just as it releases.                                                                           |
| 15:39      | And so once I managed to find that and track that down and install it and everything was                |
| 15:43      | working, some things still weren't working.                                                             |
| 15:46      | Previously, I'd attributed all of my automations or the automations that were coming up with            |
| 15:51      | like a message to say that they'd failed to run as well, shortcuts isn't working.                       |
| 15:55      | So of course, you know, that the automation is not going to work right.                                 |
| 16:00      | But instead, I found that there were some things that just needed, I just needed apparently             |
| 16:06      | to open the automation and that was fine again.                                                         |
| 16:09      | And there were some other things where I was just doing a run shortcut and I decided that               |
| 16:12      | I was just going to take advantage of the fact that, you know, that some things weren't                 |
| 16:16      | working right and delete the automation, create new automation that does the same thing.                |
| 16:20      | But instead of using the what would the new workflow for iOS 17 is, which is blank automation           |
| 16:26      | using the run shortcut action, I would just run the shortcut directly.                                  |
| 16:29      | And that seems thus far to have solved my problems with automations.                                    |
| 16:35      | But yeah, it's it's been interesting, like creating new automations and so on, and turning              |
| 16:42      | them off and turning them on again, because previously you just have a toggle to disable                |
| 16:46      | your automations.                                                                                       |
| 16:48      | And now instead of what you have is an like an automation drop down list, essentially,                  |
| 16:53      | so you tap on automation, and it gives you the options, depending on what's available                   |
| 16:57      | for the run immediately, run after confirmation or don't run, which is the disabled option              |
| 17:02      | that you had previously as a toggle.                                                                    |
| 17:05      | So yeah, it's it's it's been interesting experimenting with that.                                       |
| 17:10      | But it's it's been pretty thus far smooth.                                                              |
| 17:14      | As far as these things can be smooth for me, David, what about you?                                     |
| 17:18      | It's been great.                                                                                        |
| 17:19      | I, you know, it's been great, I say, but there's an asterisk.                                           |
| 17:22      | I was having trouble getting automations to run on the Mac.                                             |
| 17:24      | It seems to be going better now.                                                                        |
| 17:27      | But overall, I haven't had situations like in the past years, where suddenly a bunch                    |
| 17:31      | of my shortcuts were just busted, didn't work anymore.                                                  |
| 17:35      | So everything is generally working.                                                                     |
| 17:38      | And I think that we've had, you know, a less dramatic year with shortcuts in general, which             |
| 17:44      | is OK with me, you know, they, they were getting the platform, you know, switched over to the           |
| 17:49      | Mac after the purchase, then they were getting it trying to, you know, like dial it in because          |
| 17:53      | it really was a two year project to get the shortcuts on the Mac to where it really needed              |
| 17:57      | to be.                                                                                                  |
| 17:58      | And now we're in a refinement year.                                                                     |
| 18:00      | And I think that's OK.                                                                                  |
| 18:02      | And in general, the the betas have been fine, and my shortcuts have not been breaking.                  |
| 18:07      | And in fact, they have led me to some changes, which we'll talk about after the break.                  |

| 20:13      | All right, so I tease this, I know I'm not supposed to do that, but I did.                              |
| 20:20      | We had the betas in and every year, the first concern is, is it going to break everything?              |
| 20:26      | And I think it generally hasn't.                                                                        |
| 20:28      | But then the next question is, well, how can I take advantage of the new toys?                          |
| 20:31      | You know, right?                                                                                        |
| 20:32      | Because we're Automators.                                                                               |
| 20:33      | We want to automate more to the extent [[Apple]] gives us more rope, we are going to use it.                |
| 20:38      | Rose, what are you doing differently with the new beta toys?                                            |
| 20:43      | Well, specifically, the thing that I've definitely been doing the most is when you create an            |
| 20:49      | automation instead of just, you know, creating an automation, having sort of a shortcuts                |
| 20:54      | like UI, you can select a shortcut to run.                                                              |
| 20:56      | So I've been going through and making changes to all of that.                                           |
| 21:01      | But other than that, I have been doing my absolute best to leave it alone, follow the                   |
| 21:07      | if it ain't broke, don't fix it, because otherwise you're trying to fix this with really bad            |
| 21:11      | internet.                                                                                               |
| 21:12      | So, yeah, it's been one of those things where I've been playing a bit like creating new                 |
| 21:18      | shortcuts and creating new versions of shortcuts.                                                       |
| 21:21      | But I've not been going too wild with it just yet.                                                      |
| 21:26      | What about you?                                                                                         |
| 21:27      | There's a couple of things.                                                                             |
| 21:29      | First of all, we didn't mention the prior segment, but we did say in our last episode,                  |
| 21:32      | everything's running faster.                                                                            |
| 21:34      | That continues to be true for me.                                                                       |
| 21:35      | I haven't noticed a market improvement of just the way shortcuts run it.                                |
| 21:42      | There's not as much delay now, and I think that's a good thing.                                         |
| 21:46      | But I have been really re-exploring [[Stage Manager]] because we got some [[Stage Manager]]                     |
| 21:52      | automation, and it's not a lot of automation, it's ability to turn it off and on.                       |
| 21:57      | But I could see like a world where I would use [[Stage Manager]] more.                                      |
| 22:02      | It's not what I would call a power user feature, really.                                                |
| 22:06      | There are some limitations on it.                                                                       |
| 22:07      | But when I see these automation actions showing up, it makes me wish there was a little more            |
| 22:12      | control we could have over [[Stage Manager]].                                                               |
| 22:15      | What if we could have sets of [[Stage Manager]] setups that could be saved and we could restore             |
| 22:20      | them?                                                                                                   |
| 22:21      | Kind of like a combination of [[Moom]] and [[Stage Manager]].                                                   |
| 22:25      | I've been trying to roll my own version of that by turning it on and then having [[Moom]]                   |
| 22:33      | window setup saved that I can run.                                                                      |
| 22:36      | There is an [[AppleScript]] command to run a [[Moom]] setup.                                                    |
| 22:43      | To run it out of shortcuts, you use the on-run shortcut [[AppleScript]].                                    |
| 22:48      | There's an [[AppleScript]] action that has an on-run command in it.                                         |
| 22:52      | But the actual shortcut is tell application, open quote, [[Moom]], close quote, to arrange                  |
| 22:59      | windows according to the snapshot, and then you put in the name of the snapshot, like                   |
| 23:04      | mail processing, or podcasting, or whatever it is you do, and that has to be in quotes,                 |
| 23:09      | and then there's another one.                                                                           |
| 23:10      | This is return input.                                                                                   |
| 23:12      | I will put a screenshot if we can figure out a way to do that.                                          |
| 23:16      | I will put something in the show notes.                                                                 |
| 23:19      | What I can do is I'll put a link to the bunch docs in here because Bunch actually has this              |
| 23:25      | exact one listed in their [[Moom]] documentation section.                                                   |
| 23:30      | I'll pop that into the show notes and just note that that's the [[AppleScript]] to run [[Moom]].                |
| 23:37      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 23:38      | What I'm doing is I'm activating the [[Stage Manager]], I'm arranging, and then I'm opening                 |
| 23:44      | the apps that I want, and then I'm hitting a button in [[Moom]] that does it, and I can                     |
| 23:49      | open the apps also via automation.                                                                      |
| 23:52      | I've been trying to figure out a way to do this with shortcuts only.                                    |
| 23:55      | This would be a lot easier using [[Keyboard Maestro]] because it gives you more granular                    |
| 23:59      | control, but the combination of open app plus that [[Moom]] [[AppleScript]] that you can embed in               |
| 24:08      | a shortcut gives me a way to assemble setups the way I want them, and then they're just                 |
| 24:14      | shown on the left side of the screen.                                                                   |
| 24:16      | The idea of this is to allow you to focus on just what you're working on.                               |
| 24:20      | You could have all your communications apps in one bunching or group, and these terms                   |
| 24:25      | are hard to use because there's so many apps using them now, but like a grouping of your                |
| 24:29      | comms apps, a grouping of your research apps, a grouping of your writing apps, and you just             |
| 24:34      | pick on the grouping you want, and then it automatically appears, and you're creating                   |
| 24:39      | them via automation with a combination of the open app plus that [[Moom]] command.                          |
| 24:45      | That was a lot of words.                                                                                |
| 24:46      | Does that make sense?                                                                                   |
| 24:47      | Yeah, it does.                                                                                          |
| 24:49      | I think for me, the part that's really missing, at least from my perspective, is I've been              |
| 24:55      | using [[Stage Manager]] heavily on my iPad.                                                                 |
| 24:58      | I love [[Stage Manager]] on the iPad.                                                                       |
| 25:01      | It's great, at least for me, it works wonderfully.                                                      |
| 25:04      | The part that's really missing are the shortcut sections because I can't use another app there          |
| 25:11      | to do this.                                                                                             |
| 25:12      | I have to do it with shortcuts, so I can open apps, but I can't open them and send them                 |
| 25:16      | to a particular stage or put them in any particular place.                                              |
| 25:20      | The best I can do is open things in split screen or slide over, which doesn't really translate,         |
| 25:25      | and so I'd really love it if those could get updated at some point.                                     |
| 25:30      | That said, I also tend not to need the same stages again and again beyond open these two                |
| 25:38      | things side-by-side, in which case, open these two apps in split screen works just fine                 |
| 25:42      | for me.                                                                                                 |
| 25:45      | I'm doing okay with that, but it's still one of those things where it feels less smooth                 |
| 25:54      | than it ought to slash could, and I think that's just a case of the shortcuts folks                     |
| 26:01      | don't have the access to the right hooks, and the folks that do have the access to the                  |
| 26:04      | right hooks haven't created the shortcut support that's needed, so I'm crossing my fingers              |
| 26:09      | that will appear at some point, but who knows that may be iOS 18, but as it is, at least                |
| 26:14      | on Mac, there's definitely some workarounds for that, which is great.                                   |
| 26:18      | I really feel like the two pieces of this that need more work is just what Rose talked                  |
| 26:23      | about, window arrangement and management, which shortcuts on all platforms has some                     |
| 26:28      | support for, but it's very rudimentary compared to what third parties are doing.                        |
| 26:33      | The other thing that is weird for someone who likes to do automation is you got to take                 |
| 26:39      | the mouse like an animal, you got to push it on top of the grouping that you want, click                |
| 26:44      | the button, there's really no way to automate the process of saying, give me the communication          |
| 26:49      | apps.                                                                                                   |
| 26:50      | Now, people listening know that I've done videos and talked about this in the labs where                |
| 26:54      | I've done this with spaces, and it's very simple, you push one button, everything just                  |
| 26:59      | happens, your Mac rearranges itself, and they're saying, hey, Sparky, why are you even bothering        |
| 27:04      | with this?                                                                                              |
| 27:05      | You've already solved the problem, at least on the Mac, but I think this stuff needs to                 |
| 27:08      | be more accessible to people.                                                                           |
| 27:11      | If we could get it with the built-in [[Stage Manager]] to be reliable and make a shortcut                   |
| 27:16      | someone could download and just run, I would love for that to work, and it's just not quite             |
| 27:22      | there yet.                                                                                              |
| 27:23      | No, no, that's the thing, and I think it's one of those things as well that people tend                 |
| 27:28      | not to go back and look as well, and this is something I'm certainly guilty of throughout               |
| 27:33      | betas and so on as well as I don't always go back and check, and I try to have a list                   |
| 27:38      | of things that I want to go back and check, but I don't always remember.                                |
| 27:42      | One of the things that I've noticed is missing in particular is they threw this in as part              |
| 27:49      | of the sort of announcement at the [[WWDC]] keynote that [[Safari]] on macOS is getting profiles,           |
| 27:57      | so you'll be able to have a work profile and a personal profile allowing you to be logged               |
| 28:00      | in to say two Google accounts at the same time.                                                         |
| 28:03      | Lovely idea, 10 out of 10 in favor of that.                                                             |
| 28:06      | This is in addition to tab groups, so I'm there going, brilliant, love it, and yeah,                    |
| 28:14      | you guessed it, folks.                                                                                  |
| 28:16      | There's no shortcut sections for this, this is an [[AppleScript]], this is nothing, and it's               |
| 28:20      | just one of those things of like, I just wanted the support for that because [[Safari]] on Mac              |
| 28:28      | is unfortunately liking behind [[Safari]] on iOS and iPadOS with regards to shortcut sections,              |
| 28:34      | and it's just one of those things of, you know, if they brought out the shortcut sections               |
| 28:38      | with new stuff without bringing it in for the old stuff, I would still have been a grumpy,              |
| 28:42      | but like there's just no shortcut sections for [[Safari]] on macOS, at least no new ones,                   |
| 28:47      | and they haven't been in a while, and it's just I would really like to see those sooner                 |
| 28:50      | rather than later.                                                                                      |
| 28:51      | Yes, and like selecting a tab group, which is, I talked about this two weeks ago on                     |
| 28:57      | the show, I just don't understand how the action exists on the iPhone and the iPad.                     |
| 29:06      | It would make these types of setup scripts I write so much easier if I could say, and                   |
| 29:10      | open [[Safari]] and give me all the tabs to do this thing, and you can do that manually.                    |
| 29:16      | You can tell it, open this up, but when you have tab groups and they're already all set                 |
| 29:20      | up for you, wouldn't it be easier just to say open up the tab group for writing a sales                 |
| 29:25      | proposal or, you know, scheduling the soccer game?                                                      |
| 29:29      | It really would, and I have a feeling, you know, because [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] and notes, for example,              |
| 29:34      | have the same actions across iOS and iPadOS and macOS, and I love that, that's great.                   |
| 29:40      | I have a feeling that the real reason for that is underneath notes and [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] got                    |
| 29:45      | a rewrite on macOS, and they are now the same app, where [[Safari]] is still two separate animals           |
| 29:51      | on iOS and macOS, making that sort of thing much more complicated.                                      |
| 29:56      | And if you remember back a few years, the [[Things]] app would have things for iPhone actions               |
| 30:01      | and things for iPad actions and things for Mac actions.                                                 |
| 30:04      | And if you wanted to have the same shortcut work on your iPhone and your iPad, a lot of                 |
| 30:09      | people worked around that by just installing things for iPhone on their iPad as well so                 |
| 30:13      | that the shortcut actions would just run, and that would be it.                                         |
| 30:17      | And that's certainly a way to work around it, but it doesn't work on Mac.                               |
| 30:20      | Fortunately, you know, the shortcuts team, and I'm guessing the operating system teams                  |
| 30:26      | as well, worked together to figure out a way that you could then get everything together                |
| 30:32      | so that those same actions, you know, the add tasks to things or whatever the equivalent                |
| 30:38      | would be, can be the same action across platforms.                                                      |
| 30:41      | Clearly, the [[Safari]] team are taking advantage of this to an extent, but I don't know if                 |
| 30:45      | it's just that the [[Safari]] for Mac team are totally overwhelmed with everything else                     |
| 30:48      | that they've got to do, or just the underlying infrastructure is there to support doing this            |
| 30:55      | kind of automation on Mac, or maybe they just think that people don't want it on the Mac,               |
| 30:59      | and therefore they're not investing the time in it, in which case I feel like it's kind                 |
| 31:04      | of a chicken and the egg problem.                                                                       |
| 31:05      | People won't use it because it's not there, and they won't add it because people won't                  |
| 31:08      | use it.                                                                                                 |
| 31:10      | And we all remember what happened to the Microsoft Windows phone, right, folks?                         |
| 31:14      | Yeah, it doesn't exist anymore, chicken and the egg problem.                                            |
| 31:17      | There were no apps because there were no users, no users because there were no apps.                    |
| 31:21      | And it's one of those things.                                                                           |
| 31:23      | If there were parity across these things, then it would be a lot easier to, you know,                   |
| 31:28      | say to people, you know, like, yeah, you should really give this a try.                                 |
| 31:32      | Don't worry if you decide after a while that you want to get a Mac from your iPad, everything           |
| 31:36      | that you do there will just work.                                                                       |
| 31:38      | Because at the moment, like, it's so close to there, but it's not quite.                                |
| 31:42      | Well, I would encourage you that if you are using the betas and the ability to choose                   |
| 31:47      | tab groups or switch between user modes on [[Safari]] is something you'd like to do on your                 |
| 31:51      | Mac, submit feedback.                                                                                   |
| 31:54      | You know, I think the more they hear that, the more likely it is to get some engineering                |
| 31:58      | time.                                                                                                   |
| 31:59      | Yes, absolutely.                                                                                        |
| 32:00      | But I'm sad about that.                                                                                 |
| 32:01      | I really am.                                                                                            |
| 32:02      | I felt like that was a gimme.                                                                           |
| 32:04      | I feel like, oh, we're definitely going to get that this year because I was kind of generally           |
| 32:08      | in the past, a lot of times they add new features and we get the shortcut support a year later.         |
| 32:13      | Like, they're just getting to the, you know, they're just getting it done in time to get                |
| 32:16      | it out with the release, but then they've got another year.                                             |
| 32:19      | So the shortcuts team or whoever makes the actions can kind of go and sweep up afterwards               |
| 32:25      | and get the actions, but we didn't even get it after a year, which makes me wonder, you                 |
| 32:30      | know, is it just a choice not to do it or, you know, and who knows, we're on the outside.               |
| 32:36      | It could also just be that, like Rose said, it's technically impossible or something,                   |
| 32:40      | but I just hope that they get that because that would make my automation ability and                    |
| 32:45      | the ability to share usable automation with people who aren't necessarily super nerdy a                 |
| 32:52      | lot easier.                                                                                             |
| 32:54      | Same thing goes for the email box selection.                                                            |
| 32:56      | It's just like, it's so nice to have a script that opens your mail application to the exact             |
| 33:02      | box that you want it to and we have that on iPhone and iPad and we don't have it on the                 |
| 33:06      | Mac and I just don't know why, but my guess is, you know, same, it's the same story.                    |
| 33:11      | You know, they're two different apps and it's not as easy as porting one thing to the next.             |
| 33:16      | You've got it like right new code and for whatever reason they haven't done it yet.                     |
| 33:20      | And especially if you've got two separate teams, you know, working on, you know, the                    |
| 33:25      | Mac app and the iOS app, which is entirely possible, even if there's, you know, some crossover          |
| 33:29      | between them with code and or developers, you know, it doesn't mean that it's easy to                   |
| 33:34      | do at all.                                                                                              |
| 33:36      | So you know, I'm not blaming the developers for that.                                                   |
| 33:38      | I just wish somebody could prioritise this somewhere in the chain so that we would get                  |
| 33:43      | it because I'm sure those folks are just as frustrated as we are that these things aren't               |
| 33:46      | there.                                                                                                  |
| 33:47      | Well, it's just hard because I want more people to use shortcuts, but every time you have               |
| 33:52      | this lack of parity between platforms, you're like, well, wait a second, I could make a                 |
| 33:56      | shortcut for that on my phone, how come I can't do that on my Mac?                                      |
| 34:00      | It's just one more way you lose them along the way.                                                     |
| 34:04      | And I just would like to somewhere at [[Apple]], there should be a list of everything on the                |
| 34:09      | iPhone that's not on the Mac and somebody should, you know, get a big whiteboard and                    |
| 34:14      | just start checking those off for us.                                                                   |
| 34:15      | That would be great.                                                                                    |
| 34:17      | That's all.                                                                                             |
| 34:18      | I'm just going to give you some work.                                                                   |
| 34:20      | Let's talk about the [[Apple Watch]].                                                                       |
| 34:21      | There are some nice changes with this [[Apple Watch]].                                                      |
| 34:24      | I'm just going to go out right in front of this one.                                                    |
| 34:26      | I've been using the beta watch.                                                                         |
| 34:28      | I think this is the best improvement to the watch OS that has happened yet.                             |
| 34:33      | I'm glad you're saying that, David.                                                                     |
| 34:34      | I don't disagree that it's great, but oh my God, is my muscle memory broken.                            |
| 34:39      | It's so broken.                                                                                         |
| 34:40      | Like, I'll like raise my wrist to swipe across, to look at my watch and go, oh, right.                  |
| 34:46      | Okay.                                                                                                   |
| 34:47      | Cool.                                                                                                   |
| 34:48      | But I actually want a different watch face right now.                                                   |
| 34:49      | I would like another watch face.                                                                        |
| 34:50      | And so I go to swipe, nothing happens, because now you tap and hold, and then you can switch            |
| 34:57      | between the watch faces, which is fine.                                                                 |
| 34:59      | Like I'm cool with that.                                                                                |
| 35:01      | Like I don't mind it, but it's the same as like swiping up from the control centre gives                |
| 35:05      | me widgets.                                                                                             |
| 35:06      | Swiping down still gives me notifications, but you now press the side button to get your                |
| 35:11      | control centre.                                                                                         |
| 35:14      | And yeah, just the fact that I can't swipe up to get to things like ping my iPhone, which               |
| 35:18      | it turns out I do a lot more than I thought I did.                                                      |
| 35:23      | It is broken my muscle memory a bit, but this is also a good thing because it's encouraged              |
| 35:29      | me to explore my watch faces a little bit more and play with things a bit more.                         |
| 35:34      | And I've actually added some new shortcuts to my library, which I run from complications                |
| 35:39      | so that from certain watch faces, I can just go, you know, tap this to do this thing that               |
| 35:45      | you might otherwise do from the control centre.                                                         |
| 35:49      | So yeah, in particular, like setting my phone into certain do not stir modes or focus modes.            |
| 35:57      | That's one of the things that I do.                                                                     |
| 35:58      | So yeah, that's something that's very useful to have on hand for me.                                    |
| 36:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 36:04      | And just so to be clear, traditionally they had on the watch, I think what they called                  |
| 36:07      | a dock, and it was I think about eight apps that you could select for the dock.                         |
| 36:12      | And if you hit the button below the digital ground, you could scroll through those and                  |
| 36:17      | work on them.                                                                                           |
| 36:18      | And now it's much more like the old Siri watch face.                                                    |
| 36:21      | You don't push the button instead.                                                                      |
| 36:24      | You just turn the wheel of the digital crown and it just brings up apps that it thinks                  |
| 36:30      | you should see.                                                                                         |
| 36:31      | I like if you have a calendar appointment coming up soon, it'll show if you've got a                    |
| 36:35      | timer running, it'll show it's contextually aware.                                                      |
| 36:39      | So it gives you generally and accurately in my experience what you need to see most.                    |
| 36:44      | You can long press on that and add specific apps to it.                                                 |
| 36:49      | There's not, you know, third party support yet because the third party apps are in early                |
| 36:53      | beta release.                                                                                           |
| 36:54      | That's not entirely true, David.                                                                        |
| 36:56      | So I found there are a couple of apps that do have support for this already.                            |
| 37:02      | And one of them is one of our favourite apps.                                                            |
| 37:05      | It's Timery.                                                                                            |
| 37:06      | Timery already has support.                                                                             |
| 37:08      | And now I am running the Timery beta, but I was running the Timery beta beforehand, but                 |
| 37:12      | I believe what this comes from is the large watch complication for the modular face.                    |
| 37:20      | And you needed to be using like the latest thing to create that when you added that.                    |
| 37:26      | But Timery has support.                                                                                 |
| 37:27      | I've noticed Air Mail, Secure Shellfish, Oura, and a couple of other apps as well, like Home             |
| 37:35      | Plus.                                                                                                   |
| 37:37      | So some of it, it does explicitly say shows watch complications, and other stuff is just                |
| 37:42      | kind of like it is just showing up.                                                                     |
| 37:43      | So I don't know what magic these developers have done, but congratulations to you.                      |
| 37:47      | If you are one of the developers that's done this and you've, you know, you followed the                |
| 37:53      | [[Apple]] guidelines of when they were talking, they did this years ago, they were talking                  |
| 37:57      | about Auto Layout.                                                                                      |
| 37:58      | And they were like, yeah, Auto Layout's great.                                                          |
| 38:00      | Like if you use Auto Layout, then when, you know, when stuff changes, then it just all                  |
| 38:04      | kind of like magically snaps into place, and some developers were like, yeah, great, I'm                |
| 38:08      | hopping on this Auto Layout bandwagon, and other developers know I'm, I'm gonna stick                   |
| 38:13      | with what I'm doing, you know, it works, it's fine.                                                     |
| 38:16      | And then the next year [[Apple]] introduces split screen for iPadOS, which by the way, if you're            |
| 38:21      | running Auto Layout, it's going to be pretty simple to, to just update this and, and you'll             |
| 38:26      | be good to go.                                                                                          |
| 38:27      | And all the developers who'd hard coded everything went, ah, it feels like, yeah, it feels like         |
| 38:32      | that where, you know, whoever was using the latest widget kit stuff and, and complication               |
| 38:36      | stuff for the [[Apple Watch]], maybe got a bit of a freebie here.                                           |
| 38:39      | Hope fingers crossed for you developers that it is indeed a freebie, but it's, it's pretty              |
| 38:43      | nice to see that there's apps already in, in my watch with these, these fancy widgets.                  |
| 38:49      | And there is a limit you can, so you can add apps to the scrolling list, but I think it's               |
| 38:54      | again around eight, but I did hit the limit online and said, no, you can't add anymore.                 |
| 39:01      | But it's still, even with it maxed out, it's giving me the information I need.                          |
| 39:04      | Like I run timers all day.                                                                              |
| 39:07      | And historically, I've run a lot of information dense watch faces because I have all the stuff          |
| 39:12      | going on and I just want to see it.                                                                     |
| 39:14      | I have found that using a simpler watch face, like, you know, an analog dial face, which                |
| 39:20      | is what I, I personally prefer, but being able to just, just hit the crown and scroll to                |
| 39:24      | get me anything I need about upcoming appointments or whatever.                                         |
| 39:29      | I find that is a really good compromise and it's going to really work for me.                           |
| 39:33      | It's going to allow me to use less dense faces and I think a lot of people are going to be              |
| 39:39      | big fans of this.                                                                                       |
| 39:40      | Now, the button that would historically open that dock now, that brings up the control                  |
| 39:44      | centre that people had to swipe up for before.                                                          |
| 39:47      | And I'm kind of, I understand where Rose is coming from on that because if you're a power               |
| 39:51      | user you've known for years that you just swipe up from the bottom to get to that control               |
| 39:55      | centre, I think a lot of people didn't know that though, you know, and I feel like [[Apple]]                |
| 40:00      | wanted to make it more deliberate and now you push that button.                                         |
| 40:03      | But because I'm jumping between focus modes all day, I find it just fine on the button.                 |
| 40:09      | That's cool.                                                                                            |
| 40:10      | Cause my watch is one of my favourite places to change a focus mode and you just lift your               |
| 40:14      | wrist, push the button, change the focus mode and you're off to the races.                              |
| 40:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 40:19      | For me and my family, like I've observed my parents as well and they definitely swipe                   |
| 40:24      | up to, you know, do things like, in particular turn on like theatre mode or cinema mode is              |
| 40:30      | now called or ping their devices or check battery life, things like that.                               |
| 40:36      | I know you can put battery life in a complication, but they definitely swipe up for those things        |
| 40:41      | as well.                                                                                                |
| 40:43      | So yeah, it's going to be interesting seeing what happens there for folks.                              |
| 40:49      | I think some people will be fine with it.                                                               |
| 40:51      | Some people are not going to be fine with it.                                                           |
| 40:53      | Some people are going to be like, what happened to that thing?                                          |
| 40:56      | You know?                                                                                               |
| 40:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 40:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 40:59      | But as it is, it is what it is.                                                                         |
| 41:00      | It's going to change.                                                                                   |
| 41:01      | I suspect my grandmother, who does use this as well, you know, she will be getting a little             |
| 41:07      | less confused that she, she swiped upwards and now there's stuff.                                       |
| 41:11      | And then she pressed the cramp.                                                                         |
| 41:12      | Sometimes she pressed and hold it for too long and that would, you know, start the countdown            |
| 41:15      | of calling the emergency services at which point she'd let go and panic and then call                   |
| 41:18      | me and say, I think I phoned 999 again and no, no, it's fine.                                           |
| 41:22      | It's actually called 999 if you let go while it said, you know, it was counting down.                   |
| 41:27      | You're okay.                                                                                            |
| 41:28      | Don't panic.                                                                                            |
| 41:29      | It's all good.                                                                                          |
| 41:30      | But yeah, just one of those things.                                                                     |
| 41:33      | So it sounds like you're not quite as bullish on the new phone operating system as I am.                |
| 41:38      | Well, I think, you know, I'm, I'm excited for all of these things.                                      |
| 41:43      | And we're just going to have to kind of see what happens with it because as it is right                 |
| 41:49      | now, we're occurring this towards the end of June.                                                      |
| 41:52      | We've got until September until this actually comes out and I'm excited by what I'm seeing.             |
| 41:58      | I don't think this is necessarily the end.                                                              |
| 42:02      | There is always something that we don't know about that's hidden in there.                              |
| 42:06      | So we're, we'll see what, what comes out in September when they announced the new iPhones               |
| 42:11      | because there's, there's some sneaky hidden feature in there that we didn't know.                       |
| 42:16      | But as it is, I'm, I'm feeling, you know, pretty happy about what I'm seeing so far.                    |
| 42:23      | And you know, it can only get better from here on out.                                                  |
| 42:27      | And I definitely just say though, for anybody who is running the major and they're running              |
| 42:33      | into issues, please don't forget that there's a feedback about thing and you can actually               |
| 42:37      | add it to your control centre on your, on your iPhone as well.                                          |
| 42:40      | So it's easy, really, really easy to file feedback.                                                     |
| 42:43      | But yeah, it's, it's, well, there's things where, you know, it's not perfect, but nothing's             |
| 42:49      | perfect, but things can only get better, right?                                                         |
| 42:52      | Always.                                                                                                 |
| 42:53      | We're going to talk about watch faces today and automators max, but I have a lot of questions           |
| 42:57      | for you on that as well.                                                                                |
| 42:59      | Okay.                                                                                                   |
| 43:00      | So now that you've been using the betas for a while, what's missing for you?                            |
| 43:05      | That is a loaded question because I already have an answer.                                             |
| 43:07      | I want more out of the [[Apple]] basic productivity apps.                                                   |
| 43:11      | I feel like this year was a bit of a letdown and the last several years they've made nice               |
| 43:16      | improvements to [[Apple Notes\|Notes]], [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]], [[Apple Mail]], you know, [[Apple|Apple's]] just really, I think, been              |
| 43:21      | on a good trajectory with that stuff.                                                                   |
| 43:23      | And this year it sounds, it feels like they lost a bit of their momentum, both in terms                 |
| 43:28      | of features to those applications and automation support.                                               |
| 43:32      | I think it's one of those things where that really, it's really difficult to get things                 |
| 43:37      | right.                                                                                                  |
| 43:38      | I have hit, at least for the time being, the peak with [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] and where reminders can                |
| 43:43      | go.                                                                                                     |
| 43:44      | And I'm not saying that as a power user, the power user in me is like there's so much                     |
| 43:48      | more you can add, hello defer dates, but the regular user inside of me, the person who                  |
| 43:54      | observes my parents and my grandmother and so on using this stuff, you know, it's kind                  |
| 44:00      | of at the point right now where it's about as complex as you can get for a normal user                  |
| 44:06      | and still be understandable, but have the features where they're like, actually, I quite                |
| 44:10      | like a list of all the things that I said that I needed, like I want to do at this location.            |
| 44:15      | And it sort of crosses that boundary relatively nicely at the moment where those features               |
| 44:21      | are there if you're looking for them, but they're not in your way and in your face if                   |
| 44:25      | you don't.                                                                                              |
| 44:26      | And this is something that I've observed generally with productivity tools, you know, and people        |
| 44:30      | open up something that they've heard is great and amazing.                                              |
| 44:33      | And then they're like, Oh, God, this is complicated, like what is like, there's so much stuff           |
| 44:39      | here and there's, there's columns, but they're empty because I didn't put anything in them.             |
| 44:42      | Do I have to put something in them?                                                                     |
| 44:44      | Things like that, it gets overwhelming fast.                                                            |
| 44:48      | I will say the cross linking inside [[Apple Notes]] is great.                                               |
| 44:53      | I'm really excited by that.                                                                             |
| 44:54      | And also the PDF annotation there too.                                                                  |
| 44:56      | I think that that is really nice.                                                                       |
| 44:59      | That is going to hit like a really good point for a lot of users where they want things                 |
| 45:04      | like that, but they are looking to, you know, use something that, you know, would come under            |
| 45:09      | the acronym of PKM personal knowledge management system being silent hidden letter there.               |
| 45:17      | So I feel like this is, this is good, especially when combined with the notes collaboration,            |
| 45:22      | it makes notes into a really powerful tool.                                                             |
| 45:25      | So I'm pretty excited by that, to be honest.                                                            |
| 45:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 45:28      | I want to work backwards on that for starting with what your comments on notes.                         |
| 45:32      | I agree.                                                                                                |
| 45:33      | People who like roam research and [[Obsidian]] even [[Craft]] are not going to be looking at                    |
| 45:38      | this as a replacement.                                                                                  |
| 45:40      | It's not nearly as powerful, but the ability to create a link is really great.                          |
| 45:45      | And they, they did it in a very simple way.                                                             |
| 45:48      | It indexes your notes live.                                                                             |
| 45:50      | So you can just type in the name of a note and then you're good to go and you've got                    |
| 45:54      | this link.                                                                                              |
| 45:55      | I think that is going to be something that lands with people on [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]].                              |
| 46:00      | I understand what you're saying.                                                                        |
| 46:02      | And I hope you're wrong.                                                                                |
| 46:03      | I feel like there is more room and [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]].                                                           |
| 46:06      | You know, I deal with a lot of people in the max parking labs who are not necessarily                   |
| 46:10      | needing a super powerful task manager, but they do want some of the power features.                     |
| 46:16      | And so many of them are just on the cusp of using [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]], like they're using things.                 |
| 46:21      | But if just [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] gets a little bit better, they want to switch.                                    |
| 46:25      | And I feel like [[Apple]] is so close with it.                                                              |
| 46:28      | I just want to push them another 10%, you know, like you said, defer dates.                             |
| 46:34      | And there's just a couple of little features they need to add to really make that an app                |
| 46:38      | that can scale up for people that want it.                                                              |
| 46:41      | And one thing that gives me a little bit of hope is they added essentially [[Kanban]] boards                |
| 46:45      | to [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] this year.                                                                                 |
| 46:48      | And Rose, have you played with that at all?                                                             |
| 46:51      | I haven't really had a chance to know.                                                                  |
| 46:52      | I tend to only use [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]].                                                                           |
| 46:55      | Well, I actually use [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] fairly heavily because it's great when you're driving to                 |
| 46:59      | be able to say, hey, [[Apple]] lady, add this or remind me of this and so on.                               |
| 47:04      | And then, you know, I have shortcuts and my push cut automation server just go off and                  |
| 47:09      | magically sort that stuff so it all ends up in the right places.                                        |
| 47:12      | So a chunk of it ends up in OmniFocus and so on.                                                        |
| 47:15      | But I do use [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] for location-based things, specifically like when I get into                     |
| 47:21      | the car or out of the car and when I get home things, just because that works.                          |
| 47:28      | That works pretty well for me.                                                                          |
| 47:29      | The fact that it then hangs around on my home screen until it's done and it's just kind                 |
| 47:35      | of like there and in my face works very nicely.                                                         |
| 47:40      | So yeah, you know, I do use [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]].                                                                  |
| 47:43      | I haven't yet used the [[Kanban]] stuff simply because I don't have a need for that because                 |
| 47:49      | my big task management stuff, like anything that's basically like these things are actually             |
| 47:55      | related to each other in one way or another, happens in OmniFocus.                                      |
| 47:59      | The rest of it just happens, you know, the rest of it's just, you know, as it is.                       |
| 48:06      | But it looks pretty cool to me and I'm definitely excited to see what people do with this because       |
| 48:13      | I think that this will be very useful.                                                                  |
| 48:15      | Well, I just sent you a screenshot and it's fairly basic, right?                                        |
| 48:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 48:19      | But you can set up a reminder and put it in a column view or a section view as they call                |
| 48:25      | it and then you can arrange it by columns.                                                              |
| 48:28      | And then you can put subtasks into that reminder and essentially create a little project [[Kanban]].        |
| 48:35      | And this is not going to compete again with the bigger players out there that do [[Kanban]].                |
| 48:40      | But it's free and it's already on your device.                                                          |
| 48:43      | And I really think the magic sauce of this is the sharing.                                              |
| 48:47      | I mean, they, [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] is one of the best in class for sharing task lists.                             |
| 48:52      | You know, if you're, everybody's on an [[Apple]] platform, it's just so easy to push one button.            |
| 48:57      | There's no subscription or anything.                                                                    |
| 48:58      | You just have sharing.                                                                                  |
| 49:00      | And I feel like for project planning, this can be really beneficial with small [[Apple]] based              |
| 49:06      | teams.                                                                                                  |
| 49:07      | And that's like an advanced feature to me.                                                              |
| 49:10      | And so I feel like the fact that they put this in means that there's still some gas                     |
| 49:13      | in a tank over there to improve [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]].                                                              |
| 49:17      | And I hope that's true.                                                                                 |
| 49:18      | Oh yeah, definitely.                                                                                    |
| 49:20      | But then you get to the automation side of this.                                                        |
| 49:22      | I mean, we're the Automators, right?                                                                    |
| 49:24      | The automation of [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] kind of stinks.                                                             |
| 49:27      | Like I've been playing with this feature, I'm trying to teach about it in the labs and                  |
| 49:32      | like setting up a project in OmniFocus with automation is super easy.                                   |
| 49:37      | You can decide what kind of list is, you know, is it linear?                                            |
| 49:41      | Is it, you know, is it, um, I forget the terms OmniFocus uses, um, there is parallel versus             |
| 49:46      | sequential versus single action, exactly, exactly.                                                      |
| 49:50      | They don't have anything like that.                                                                     |
| 49:51      | [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]].                                                                                              |
| 49:52      | And in fact, if you want them to go in a sequential order, you have to put them in reverse because      |
| 49:57      | the way shortcuts renders it, it puts basically, it keeps it adds.                                      |
| 50:02      | If you give it a sub task, it puts it at the top of the list, then the next sub task you                |
| 50:07      | give it puts it in between that one and the top of the list and it just keeps pushing                   |
| 50:11      | them down.                                                                                              |
| 50:12      | But then it doesn't even do that consistently.                                                          |
| 50:14      | So there's like a whole bunch of stuff in here that's like kind of wacky that if anybody                |
| 50:19      | was trying to use this at like kind of like second level complexity, it would be obvious                |
| 50:25      | that the stuff needs work and it's just not, not really getting it.                                     |
| 50:28      | And as far as I can tell, there was nothing new really added this year.                                 |
| 50:33      | And I do feel like the automation story for the [[Apple]] apps is, is a let down.                           |
| 50:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 50:40      | I think it's one of those things where, um, it's they didn't necessarily think that people              |
| 50:47      | would be wanting to automate this in the sense of like recreating projects or having like               |
| 50:54      | consistent like sub tasks groups and so on.                                                             |
| 50:58      | And when they did think about that, they went, okay, cool, we'll add templates and templates            |
| 51:02      | are really powerful.                                                                                    |
| 51:04      | There's something that I'm not really seeing in many other applications at all.                         |
| 51:07      | Um, you know, a directly as a feature, like they exist in many other apps with the, well,               |
| 51:11      | if you copy this, it will paste it, I'll put on your clipboard to say Taskpaper and you                |
| 51:15      | can reuse that and things like that.                                                                    |
| 51:17      | And that's been around for ages, but just to straight up, like, you know, just like                     |
| 51:22      | say this is a template.                                                                                 |
| 51:23      | Thanks.                                                                                                 |
| 51:24      | Bye.                                                                                                    |
| 51:25      | That that's not something that really exists elsewhere.                                                 |
| 51:27      | Um, so, you know, I think, you know, they, they've thought about this, but they've thought              |
| 51:31      | about this in the sense of like, okay, inside of our little world and ecosystem without the             |
| 51:37      | okay, but this is potentially a dynamic project or it is a dynamic thing.                               |
| 51:43      | And depending on exactly what this is, you know, if Bob's involved, I need the Bob list.                |
| 51:48      | If Miranda's involved, I need the Miranda list.                                                         |
| 51:51      | If Jay's involved, I need the J list, et cetera, um, and just being able to do that and dynamically     |
| 51:58      | even just rename things and so on is, um, you know, something that has not yet maybe                    |
| 52:05      | occurred to them is the wrong thing, but not yet made it through the process to be available            |
| 52:11      | to us.                                                                                                  |
| 52:12      | Because I do know that when you, um, add, um, uh, a reminder, I thought it was when you                 |
| 52:17      | added a reminder, um, then you could, um, tell it to put it at the bottom of the list                   |
| 52:22      | versus the top of the list.                                                                             |
| 52:23      | And now I'm not saying that as an option.                                                               |
| 52:25      | Um, but, uh, I thought that you could, um, do that with the, with the reminders, but                    |
| 52:32      | maybe not anymore.                                                                                      |
| 52:33      | Um, you know, I don't recall that that's ever been an option, but maybe I missed it.                    |
| 52:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 52:39      | It's one of those things where I thought, uh, I thought I'd seen it and now maybe I,                    |
| 52:44      | um, uh, maybe, maybe I'm, I'm thinking of something totally different, um, because I                    |
| 52:49      | do know there is a set subtasks.                                                                        |
| 52:52      | So in the edit reminder, then this is something that's a little weird, um, you can add subtasks         |
| 52:58      | to, um, a particular reminder, which is quite nice.                                                     |
| 53:03      | And then, and then it can add multiple things at the same time.                                         |
| 53:06      | That's the action I'm talking about.                                                                    |
| 53:07      | Well, the other thing that you can do though is you can add a reminder and set the parent               |
| 53:11      | reminder and depending on how you do that, that works slightly differently.                             |
| 53:15      | And I think it's just one of those things where, you know, they, they didn't necessarily                |
| 53:18      | think that people would add to the bottom versus add to the top and just it, it ended                   |
| 53:23      | up in whatever default was there, uh, and that was it.                                                  |
| 53:27      | And that's not like, that's the hill I'm going to die on, but I feel like that's just kind              |
| 53:30      | of an example of where, you know, it's not quite like, I don't expect [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] to ever                 |
| 53:36      | replace a tool like OmniFocus, you know, name your productivity app.                                    |
| 53:41      | There is, there's always some best in class apps out there that really sweat all the little             |
| 53:45      | details and this is more of a consumer thing, but, but it's just, it's interesting to me                |
| 53:50      | as they get closer to making something that's really useful for a lot of people.                        |
| 53:55      | I feel like there's just little bits they're missing and the automation piece of it to me               |
| 53:59      | is, um, is the worst of it.                                                                             |
| 54:01      | I mean, they, they just need to do more.                                                                |
| 54:03      | I feel like Notes is probably the best, uh, [[Apple]] app with automation in terms of the                   |
| 54:08      | productivity spear, but like, uh, [[Apple Mail]] and [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] and some of their other, like                |
| 54:14      | we talked earlier about [[Safari]].                                                                         |
| 54:16      | I just feel like there, there's, there's more work to be done there.                                    |
| 54:20      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 54:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 54:22      | There definitely is.                                                                                    |
| 54:23      | And I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with that over time.                                     |
| 54:25      | Um, you know, I noticed, um, the tips app got shortcut support and you might be thinking                |
| 54:30      | what tips productivity thing, but, um, there were, there was something new added to iOS                 |
| 54:35      | this year for tip kit, um, which essentially allows developers to add their own tips into,              |
| 54:41      | um, the tips app, um, and create collections of tips and things like that.                              |
| 54:45      | And also to just essentially use that framework to explain to a user how to use their app.              |
| 54:51      | So if you open, uh, say for example, a camera app for the first time, it can walk you through           |
| 54:55      | like this, how you take photo, this is how you do a video and so on and so forth, which                 |
| 54:58      | is, you know, really nice.                                                                              |
| 55:00      | Um, but you can now also open a particular collection from, uh, the tips app in shortcuts.              |
| 55:07      | And I feel like the fact that that's just got support straight off the bat is a very                    |
| 55:11      | good sign of these things to come because while you and I, David may find the tips app                  |
| 55:17      | not the most useful, um, investment of our time, um, it is certainly something that                     |
| 55:24      | plenty of people like end up using the tips app gets added to your suggested widget stack               |
| 55:30      | and things like that.                                                                                   |
| 55:31      | Um, and so it's, it's good to just see what's there for that, um, and you know, fingers                 |
| 55:38      | crossed this will end up translating into other things that I have to say, I'm a little                 |
| 55:42      | disappointed.                                                                                           |
| 55:43      | Um, you know, we have the automations for things like messages and emails incoming, but                 |
| 55:50      | the transaction option, um, does not appear at least when I last checked it, does not                   |
| 55:56      | appear to, uh, offer details of the transaction to, oh, now it does.                                    |
| 56:01      | Oh, yay.                                                                                                |
| 56:02      | I'm very pleased to report that I was wrong.                                                            |
| 56:04      | Um, so, um, they, they must have updated this in, in the latest beta, um, because, um, you              |
| 56:09      | get the transaction as an input now that you can pass into your shortcut.                               |
| 56:13      | So you, you may actually have some details of the transaction there because this was                    |
| 56:16      | something that was missing before and I was kind of sad about that, um, uh, and, uh, I                  |
| 56:21      | was chatting to some developers who are working on some finance stuff, but now, now that is             |
| 56:26      | an option.                                                                                              |
| 56:27      | So that's pretty good to see.                                                                           |
| 56:28      | Well, I have to say overall that I am very happy with the progress shortcuts has made                   |
| 56:35      | in the years has been in the [[Apple]] platform, particularly on the Mac.                                   |
| 56:39      | Like when it came on the Mac, there was a part of me that thought I would never really                  |
| 56:43      | use it much because I am a power automator.                                                             |
| 56:46      | I, I wrote a book on [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                  |
| 56:49      | I know my way around [[AppleScript]] there.                                                                |
| 56:52      | There's a lot of great options on the Mac.                                                              |
| 56:53      | You know, what do I need this, you know, pedestrian themed shortcuts for?                               |
| 56:58      | But the fact is shortcuts is the best tool in the belt, occasionally for automation and                 |
| 57:03      | I'm using it a lot more than I thought I would.                                                         |
| 57:05      | That's probably why I get wound up about it when it's got the deficiencies because I                    |
| 57:10      | want to use it more.                                                                                    |
| 57:11      | Not only do I want to use it more, I want to help more people automate and I feel like                  |
| 57:15      | this is the, by far, the easiest way to get people started.                                             |
| 57:19      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 57:20      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 57:21      | Absolutely.                                                                                             |
| 57:22      | Either way, I think we're both pretty happy with the betas though, generally, right?                    |
| 57:25      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 57:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 57:27      | I really am.                                                                                            |
| 57:28      | And I'm, I'm really pleased that things are going so well and, you know, it may not                     |
| 57:32      | appear on the surface of things that shortcuts has had a big upgrade, but just the fact that            |
| 57:36      | it's all running faster and smoother is a great sign and yes, there have been hiccups,                  |
| 57:42      | but there will always be hiccups and I'm not going to point fingers at any one person                   |
| 57:46      | or any one team as to where those hiccups are because it's, it's always a combination                   |
| 57:51      | of this was, you know, ambiguously documented and therefore this person interpreted it that             |
| 57:57      | way but the person who wrote it thought it was extremely clear that it was meant that                   |
| 58:01      | way and so on and so forth and therefore this strange combination of things happened                    |
| 58:05      | and that thing didn't work or whatever, but, you know, we're on the new beta so that's,                 |
| 58:11      | you know, we're on the first new release of the beta and overall my phone's working.                    |
| 58:18      | My iPad is working and even the Mac that, I mean, I'll admit that I barely use because                  |
| 58:23      | I've been off the grid for a couple of weeks, that's been working as well and that's impressive.        |
| 58:31      | You know, I haven't had one of those like, I just need to like grab another device and                  |
| 58:36      | do this thing moments and that's great.                                                                 |
| 58:40      | Well, I, you know, I go through this every year, betas kind of multiply on themselves                   |
| 58:45      | because the features they have then you need them on a different thing to make it work                  |
| 58:49      | and every year I try to draw the line at my production machine.                                         |
| 58:53      | In fact, I have to because one of our key applications, [[Audio Hijack]] is never going                     |
| 58:59      | to release early, they're dealing with underlying audio stuff and they really have to be careful,       |
| 59:04      | but man, I can tell you that it's always an indicator when I'm, I wish I had the beta                   |
| 59:10      | on my production machine, like the widgets on the screen and like the way, because I've                 |
| 59:17      | been testing this [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] [[Kanban]] View, I'm thinking about implementing the small                     |
| 59:21      | piece of it with my team and like not being able to use it on my Mac, dressing nuts.                    |
| 59:25      | So that's a good sign that, you know, this is a, this is a good year and I think anybody                |
| 59:31      | who's running the beta, you know, if you've got some spelunking you're doing and things                 |
| 59:35      | that are important to you, a great place to share that is over at talk.automators.fm,                   |
| 59:39      | that's our forum, lots of activity over there.                                                          |
| 59:42      | And Rose and I keep up with it.                                                                         |
| 59:44      | We'd love to see.                                                                                       |
| 59:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 59:46      | I also wanted to mention, I've been chatting to some of the moderators of the Shortcuts                 |
| 59:50      | subreddit about trying to get some of the content from there across because of course                   |
| 59:55      | Reddit has decided that they're going to go nuts and charge ridiculous amount of money                  |
| 01:00:00   | to access the API, just like Twitter did.                                                               |
| 01:00:04   | And they're looking at seeing if there's a way that we can archive the stuff from Reddit                |
| 01:00:09   | so that folks will have access to it on the Automators Forum.                                           |
| 01:00:12   | So we're looking into something that we can do for that just to make sure that no great                 |
| 01:00:17   | content gets lost because, you know, all the lovely folks using Shortcuts deserve to have               |
| 01:00:22   | a home to post about it on the internet and we're very happy to have you all in the Automators          |
| 01:00:26   | Forum.                                                                                                  |
| 01:00:27   | It's free and open to anybody using Shortcuts, which hopefully everybody listening to this              |
| 01:00:32   | podcast knows.                                                                                          |
| 01:00:33   | But yeah, just wanted to make a note of that.                                                           |
| 01:00:35   | All right.                                                                                              |
| 01:00:36   | That'll wrap it up for today.                                                                           |
