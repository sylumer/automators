| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello, I'm David Sparks and joined by my co-host, Rose Mary Orchard, and this is The               |
| 00:05      | Automators, where we talk about how to automate your technology to do your work for you.           |
| 00:10      | Hello, Rose.                                                                                       |
| 00:11      | Hey, how are you doing, David?                                                                     |
| 00:13      | Good.                                                                                              |
| 00:14      | Good.                                                                                              |
| 00:15      | We are both doing a lot of travel lately, so you are recovering from a trip.                       |
| 00:19      | I'm getting ready to leave on a trip, but we always make time for automation.                      |
| 00:24      | In fact, I feel like we've done shows on travel automation before, but I do find it's so helpful   |
| 00:29      | just this morning, I ran my little shortcut that generates my [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] list, my packing           |
| 00:35      | list.                                                                                              |
| 00:36      | I love that thing so much.                                                                         |
| 00:38      | If you go back and listen to the episode, the way I set mine up, it's got a little separate        |
| 00:41      | checklist like, is there going to be water where you're going?                                     |
| 00:45      | Are you bringing an iPad?                                                                          |
| 00:47      | So you just check off the arrays that you want and it auto-populates, it makes me so happy         |
| 00:53      | when that thing runs.                                                                              |
| 00:54      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                          |
| 00:55      | I do the same thing with [[Drafts]], so mine is just a list in [[Drafts]] and it's sorted by               |
| 01:00      | emoji.                                                                                             |
| 01:01      | Honestly, it's so great, you scroll to the soap section and that's all of the toilet               |
| 01:05      | trays.                                                                                             |
| 01:06      | Scroll to the lipstick emoji and that's all of the makeup, and then it's alphabetised              |
| 01:10      | within that because emoji, alpha sort, so all the lipstick things get grouped together             |
| 01:15      | and soap things get grouped together.                                                              |
| 01:16      | I do exactly the same.                                                                             |
| 01:17      | I have my lipstick together too.                                                                   |
| 01:18      | That's good.                                                                                       |
| 01:19      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 01:20      | I mean, you definitely should, but obviously I have a computer for techy stuff and things          |
| 01:25      | like that.                                                                                         |
| 01:26      | It's really nice to be able to do that and just be like, yes, I'm doing this, I'm doing            |
| 01:29      | this, I'm doing this.                                                                              |
| 01:30      | Do I need a costume when I'm traveling?                                                            |
| 01:32      | Is there a costume party involved or a special outfit?                                             |
| 01:35      | Check that off.                                                                                    |
| 01:36      | Maybe not traveling for costume parties so often, but I have costume party slash special           |
| 01:42      | outfit, which is a little super girl energy.                                                       |
| 01:45      | It's very satisfying watching automation create that for me and the two benefits of                |
| 01:50      | automation are always they're fast and they're reliable and they don't make mistakes.              |
| 01:55      | And just going through the list this morning after I had the shortcut generated just reminded      |
| 02:01      | me like there are things on this list I would have forgot to pack.                                 |
| 02:05      | Oh yeah.                                                                                           |
| 02:06      | And because the automation runs, I never miss a beat.                                              |
| 02:11      | And I'm always tweaking that automation, adding little bits and bobs to it, but boy do I love      |
| 02:16      | it.                                                                                                |
| 02:17      | And you know, you helped me generate that when we used a race for it.                              |
| 02:20      | It's more complicated than a very simple text list, but I'm really happy with it.                  |
| 02:26      | Either way, today we wanted to talk about [[Safari]] automation and I know this is a very              |
| 02:32      | narrow topic, but [[Safari]] is Apple's browser.                                                       |
| 02:36      | They use it across all their devices.                                                              |
| 02:39      | The reason I use [[Safari]] more than any other is because it's so respectful of battery life          |
| 02:45      | compared to its competitors.                                                                       |
| 02:47      | And I do a lot of stuff on mobile, you know, when you're in your laptop, your iPad, your           |
| 02:50      | iPhone, you don't watch your browser killing your battery and Apple does a good job of             |
| 02:54      | that.                                                                                              |
| 02:55      | I'm also pretty invested in iCloud and I like the way it shares tabs and does things.              |
| 02:59      | But there are limitations and we're going to talk about that today.                                |
| 03:03      | But I thought it'd be fun to share with automators how we kind of view getting automation done     |
| 03:11      | with [[Safari]].                                                                                       |
| 03:12      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 03:13      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 03:14      | I mean, it's one of those things.                                                                  |
| 03:15      | And actually you reminded me of something there by saying, you know, like you like things          |
| 03:18      | like the iCloud sync, and this is something I struggled with with [[Safari]] for a while.              |
| 03:22      | I was like, yeah, my tab groups aren't syncing, like I don't quite know what's going on.           |
| 03:26      | And I realised after a while that the problem was actually that I was using [[Safari Technology Preview]]      |
| 03:31      | on my Mac and [[Safari Technology Preview]] is not [[Safari]].                                     |
| 03:35      | It's like the next version.                                                                        |
| 03:37      | It's the beta version.                                                                             |
| 03:38      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 03:39      | It's got this cool purple icon, which may have contributed to me wanting to use it.                |
| 03:43      | I believe that definitely played a role for you, Rose.                                             |
| 03:46      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 03:47      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 03:48      | And [[Safari Technology Preview]] is great.                                                            |
| 03:50      | And I always love seeing the features that are coming.                                             |
| 03:52      | But the problem with it that I had was that things weren't syncing.                                |
| 03:56      | So therefore, you know, like the magic wasn't happening and my tab groups weren't on all           |
| 04:01      | of my devices and so on.                                                                           |
| 04:03      | And I couldn't figure out why for ages and that was why.                                           |
| 04:06      | So, you know, making sure you're using the right [[Safari]], definitely part of the automation         |
| 04:10      | magic because there's a whole bunch of settings that you can set up in [[Safari]] as well so that      |
| 04:14      | you get, you know, magic without really having to do anything in particularly special, like        |
| 04:21      | for example, making sure that my downloads folder is a folder that is actually watched             |
| 04:25      | by [[Hazel]] so that everything then just kind of like feeds into my other automations.                |
| 04:30      | That's what the settings that you can customise in [[Safari]].                                         |
| 04:33      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 04:34      | And just on that note, I am always on the hairy edge of the beta cycle.                            |
| 04:42      | You know, when we listen to some of our other podcaster friends who are like 15 and 20 years       |
| 04:49      | younger than I am, they always say, oh, yeah, when I was young, I would always run the betas,      |
| 04:53      | but now I'm older and wiser and I never do that.                                                   |
| 04:56      | Well, somehow I never got the message.                                                             |
| 04:59      | Right now I'm broadcasting on a computer that's running a beta looking at a phone that's on        |
| 05:04      | a beta and I've got an iPad attached that's on a beta.                                             |
| 05:07      | All that said, I don't run the technology preview of Safari.                                       |
| 05:11      | That's like where I draw the line, because I do like having all the features working               |
| 05:16      | and I don't find that seeing what's next for [[Safari]] is worth the big hole it makes in my           |
| 05:24      | life of not having [[Safari]] work reliably.                                                           |
| 05:27      | So I don't do it.                                                                                  |
| 05:28      | But you could...                                                                                   |
| 05:29      | I mean, it's not that it doesn't work reliably, it's just that things like the syncing and         |
| 05:33      | so on and like having like the tabs open on your other computers and so on, that doesn't           |
| 05:37      | work because each [[Safari Technology Preview]] install is its own little thing.                       |
| 05:44      | And so [[Safari Technology Preview]] on my Mac Studio doesn't talk to [[Safari Technology Preview]]        |
| 05:48      | on my MacBook Pro and things like that and they don't talk to [[Safari]] at all.                       |
| 05:54      | So yeah, I was missing out on iCloud magic, so that's why I don't run it, but I still              |
| 06:00      | check the release notes.                                                                           |
| 06:01      | There's cool stuff in there.                                                                       |
| 06:02      | And no iCloud sync for me means it's not working reliably though, although if they added a feature |
| 06:09      | where you could get tab groups with automation with it, I would be sorely tempted, but we          |
| 06:15      | will get to that later.                                                                            |
| 06:16      | We would be all over that.                                                                         |
| 06:19      | But I do think you kind of have a great point that the first step of automating [[Safari]] is          |
| 06:25      | in the setup of the application.                                                                   |
| 06:28      | I think a lot of people just go with the default setups and those are okay, but those are made     |
| 06:34      | by Apple for all consumers.                                                                        |
| 06:35      | But if you're an automator, you may need to take it up a much.                                     |
| 06:39      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 06:40      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 06:41      | So, you know, I already mentioned the downloads location, you know, some people like having        |
| 06:44      | stuff downloaded to their desktop.                                                                 |
| 06:45      | Some people don't.                                                                                 |
| 06:47      | The default location is your downloads folder, which is where nearly everything on my Mac          |
| 06:51      | goes when it, you know, appears out of nowhere.                                                    |
| 06:54      | And so that includes stuff like screenshots and so on.                                             |
| 06:57      | And I just, you know, I double-checked and that's where my downloads are going.                    |
| 07:02      | But there's some other things as well, like in the general settings, you know, you can             |
| 07:06      | choose what new tabs and new windows open with, and you can also choose what [[Safari]] opens          |
| 07:11      | with.                                                                                              |
| 07:12      | So if you quit [[Safari]], what happens when you reopen it?                                            |
| 07:15      | And what I have is I haven't opened all my non-private windows from the last session.              |
| 07:21      | I don't really use private windows in [[Safari]], at least not very often.                             |
| 07:26      | But if I do and then I quit [[Safari]], then it's probably something that I don't want reopening       |
| 07:30      | because it was like, you know, I was opening this to log into my mom's account in iCloud           |
| 07:34      | or something like that, obviously with her permission.                                             |
| 07:37      | And so, yeah, I've gone through and customised what happens with my new windows and my new         |
| 07:42      | tabs.                                                                                              |
| 07:43      | And I actually do use the start page in [[Safari]].                                                    |
| 07:47      | And my start page is set to my favourites in the bookmarks.                                         |
| 07:51      | So my favourites are that bar that can appear underneath the address bar.                           |
| 07:56      | And I do actually have that shown, David, I know not everybody does this, but I do have            |
| 08:02      | that shown.                                                                                        |
| 08:03      | And actually, I put all of my bookmarks in favourites.                                              |
| 08:06      | I don't know if this is an automation, but I have a folder called bookmarks inside of              |
| 08:09      | the favourites for anything that I don't really necessarily want, like, in like the main menu.      |
| 08:17      | But then, like, all of my bookmarks live inside of favourites.                                      |
| 08:20      | And so my start page is set to my favourites so that I can just see bookmarks.                      |
| 08:24      | And so, which works very well for me, especially on iOS, iOS, you know, I like being able to       |
| 08:30      | tap into the menu bar and then seeing all those favourites in my start page, you know,              |
| 08:34      | just helps if I need to quickly access one of them.                                                |
| 08:37      | That's interesting because I do the exact same thing.                                              |
| 08:40      | And let's talk about bookmarks for a second.                                                       |
| 08:44      | Bookmarks are old school automation, you know, it is a bookmark to take you to a specific          |
| 08:49      | location, but with modern Mac automation tools, and I'm talking to you, [[Raycast]], [[Hazel]] on          |
| 08:56      | all the related apps, you can access things that are your bookmark.                                |
| 09:02      | You can search your bookmarks with any of these applications like [[Alfred]].                          |
| 09:07      | You just trigger [[Alfred]], you start typing in the name of your bookmark, and you do need            |
| 09:10      | to enable it in the [[Alfred]] settings, but it's a ridiculously fast way to get to websites           |
| 09:16      | that you visit frequently.                                                                         |
| 09:19      | So that's the first reason to do bookmarks, and just like Rose, I, if you go to the view           |
| 09:23      | menu in [[Safari]], you can have it show the favourites across the top, yeah.                           |
| 09:33      | And you can nest those too.                                                                        |
| 09:34      | So like for instance, if you go into bookmark setups, you can nest it to have like the Mac         |
| 09:41      | ones together or the finance ones together, whatever, and then those will drop down, it's          |
| 09:46      | got a little disclosure triangle pointing down.                                                    |
| 09:49      | So you can really get to your most easily and frequently used bookmarks very quickly.              |
| 09:54      | I know for some people, this is like stuff they've known for a long time, but not everybody        |
| 09:58      | does.                                                                                              |
| 09:59      | Yes, exactly.                                                                                      |
| 10:00      | And it's one of those things where whenever we're coming up with, you know, fancier, better        |
| 10:05      | automations for things, like, oh, like when I type this in my URL bar, I'd really like             |
| 10:12      | autocomplete to do this, well, if you add a bookmark with the name of whatever it is               |
| 10:17      | you're going to type, then that's an autocomplete that's going to work on iOS and macOS.           |
| 10:23      | So it's certainly worth considering as an option, because honestly, adding bookmarks               |
| 10:26      | for stuff has made it way easier for me to find those websites that I go back to.                  |
| 10:31      | And this is why I have just like a generic bookmarks folder of like, this is stuff I               |
| 10:34      | don't really want to see, but you know, it's there because then when I type it, it's going         |
| 10:39      | to autocomplete it and find it, and also every so often you'll get something that somehow          |
| 10:44      | like got into your like [[Safari]] history and suggestions.                                            |
| 10:48      | And so like, you'll type in the one that always happens to me, Pimoroni, it's a Raspberry          |
| 10:53      | Pi store that's over here in the UK.                                                               |
| 10:56      | But whenever I type Pimoroni, it like tries to suggest the newsletter.                             |
| 11:01      | And I turned out I'd accidentally bookmarked a newsletter ages and ages ago.                       |
| 11:05      | And so obviously that episode, the newsletter wasn't available anymore.                            |
| 11:08      | And then it wasn't opening that.                                                                   |
| 11:10      | And so I deleted that bookmark.                                                                    |
| 11:11      | It's very easy to try to bookmark, by the way, CMD-D.                                          |
| 11:14      | And yeah, so I deleted that and made sure I had Pimoroni in my [[Safari]] bookmarks.                   |
| 11:19      | And voila, now I no longer have that dodgy autocomplete popping up.                                |
| 11:23      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 11:24      | And while bookmarks again are very basic, they also are a belt and suspenders answer               |
| 11:29      | to other automation.                                                                               |
| 11:31      | Like I frequently, and we'll talk about later in the show, I have these setups that I run          |
| 11:35      | through [[Keyboard Maestro]] and shortcuts where I'll open a bunch of tabs at once.                    |
| 11:42      | And for instance, today, when we started recording the show, I ran an automation that opened       |
| 11:47      | up everything, all the tabs I need in [[Safari]] to record a show of the Automators podcast.           |
| 11:53      | But occasionally that stuff breaks and it just happens.                                            |
| 11:55      | But you've always got that backup of those bookmarks you can go to when that happens.              |
| 12:00      | And you know, automation isn't perfect.                                                            |
| 12:01      | And sometimes you need something like that.                                                        |
| 12:04      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 12:05      | And related to that, there's a setting for your tabs where you can say that command click          |
| 12:12      | opens a link in a new tab, but then you can also command click on your bookmarks in the            |
| 12:17      | favourites section.                                                                                 |
| 12:18      | But if you command click on a folder, it's going to open all of the bookmarks in that              |
| 12:22      | folder.                                                                                            |
| 12:23      | This is why I have certain folders in my favourites because that way I can command click and it     |
| 12:30      | will open.                                                                                         |
| 12:31      | For example, I've got one for, it's just called forums and it'll open like the automators          |
| 12:35      | forum and my Paris forum and the agenda forums and the bunch forums and draft forums and           |
| 12:39      | home assistant PopClip and all of that jazz.                                                      |
| 12:41      | But I can just, you know, command click on one of those and it'll open all of those.               |
| 12:47      | Another little trick is also the middle button.                                                    |
| 12:53      | If you have like a mouse with a scroll wheel, if you click using the scroll wheel on any           |
| 12:57      | of those bookmarks, that acts as a middle click and that'll open it in a new tab.                  |
| 13:00      | Before middle clicking on a open tab will close it, which is really nice when you just             |
| 13:05      | need to get rid of some of those things.                                                           |
| 13:07      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 13:08      | I want to talk about automating and moving tabs in a minute because there's more to it             |
| 13:11      | than that.                                                                                         |
| 13:12      | Oh yeah.                                                                                           |
| 13:13      | But just kind of finishing out this topic.                                                         |
| 13:15      | How often do you audit your bookmarks?                                                             |
| 13:19      | So I don't audit them super often, but I will go through every once in a while and be like,        |
| 13:24      | oh, time for a little cleanup and get rid of stuff.                                                |
| 13:26      | I found that this is a good like, you know, brain dead activity of things to do where              |
| 13:31      | I can just like go through and get rid of stuff.                                                   |
| 13:34      | I have also used a bookmark syncing app before and I do use it still just to be clear.             |
| 13:41      | I've forgotten the name of it right now and I can't, like, I think it's BookMacster.              |
| 13:48      | It is.                                                                                             |
| 13:49      | It's BookMacster.                                                                                 |
| 13:50      | Mac is in Mac OS and I can put a link to that in the show notes, but what this will                |
| 13:54      | do is it can go through and, like, I do use it for syncing my bookmarks so that I get              |
| 13:59      | my bookmarks out of [[Safari]] into Firefox because I have a Firefox profile that then can sync        |
| 14:05      | that across to other machines and, you know, in those Firefox's.                                   |
| 14:12      | But it can also look for dead links and it can alphabetise links within folders for me             |
| 14:17      | as well, meaning that, like, you know, the various, you know, folders or bookmarks are             |
| 14:23      | all alphabetised, which is quite useful when you are looking for something and because             |
| 14:27      | it will find those dead links, I don't need to worry about, you know, too many, you know,          |
| 14:33      | bad things popping up and every so often I'll, you know, get that out and run that and, you        |
| 14:36      | know, usually I'm using [[Safari]].                                                                    |
| 14:39      | As a developer, I do love using Firefox as well for that stuff.                                    |
| 14:43      | [[Safari\|Safari's]] work developer tools, they're not bad, but I'm just so used to the ones in                |
| 14:46      | Firefox and how Firefox works and quite frankly, at least in my day job, there's very few people   |
| 14:52      | who are using [[Safari]], so while I open it to test what I've done, I'm better off using              |
| 14:57      | Firefox, given the choice between that and a Chrome-based browser, like, I stick with              |
| 15:02      | Firefox.                                                                                           |
| 15:03      | Yeah, Firefox is also my on-deck browser if I need something else for some reason.                 |
| 15:10      | Although I have to say, I don't hit that problem as much as I used to about [[Safari]] not working     |
| 15:16      | nicely with whatever websites I go to.                                                             |
| 15:18      | I mean, it used to be more frequent that [[Safari]] just wouldn't work, but it's big enough.           |
| 15:24      | I think probably because of the iPhone success that you don't see it as often.                     |
| 15:29      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                        |
| 15:30      | I think it's one of those things where a lot for a very long time, people didn't really            |
| 15:37      | think that [[Safari]] was a proper browser and just didn't really support it, so you had               |
| 15:40      | to run something else.                                                                             |
| 15:42      | And now, you know, with the rise of the popularity of [[Safari]] on the Mac and also the improvements  |
| 15:46      | of [[Safari]] has made as well, there's a really great developer team working behind [[Safari]].           |
| 15:52      | And they actually aim to be part of the web standards as well, helping create new web              |
| 15:57      | standards as well as implementing those standard web conventions in [[Safari]].                        |
| 16:04      | And I think that's gone a really long way to making [[Safari]] a proper first-class browser.           |
| 16:09      | Whereas before, people used to use the Vivaldi and Opera over [[Safari]], that definitely doesn't      |
| 16:14      | happen now.                                                                                        |
| 16:15      | And I would recommend you audit those tabs.                                                        |
| 16:19      | There's a lot of stuff I always say you should audit on your computer.                             |
| 16:22      | I'm good at some of it and bad at some of it, but the tabs are one thing that I kind               |
| 16:26      | of keep on top of because it is right there.                                                       |
| 16:28      | And for so much of what I do, the web is my workspace.                                             |
| 16:32      | So I want to make sure it's clean and gives me what I need.                                        |
| 16:36      | Let's talk a little bit about auto fill.                                                            |
| 16:38      | That's one of the [[Safari]] settings I don't think a lot of people understand.                        |
| 16:42      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 16:43      | So auto fill is, I mean, it can be a great feature.                                                 |
| 16:46      | It's the thing that can use, you know, it can auto fill in your username and your password,         |
| 16:53      | which if you are using another, you know, password management system like 1Password,             |
| 16:57      | you probably will disable.                                                                         |
| 16:58      | It can also fill out credit cards and use information from your contacts and it can                |
| 17:02      | fill out other forms.                                                                              |
| 17:03      | I personally have every single word of these unchecked because I just use 1Password to           |
| 17:07      | fill out all of these.                                                                             |
| 17:09      | But if you are using them, then I definitely recommend going and checking the auto fill             |
| 17:12      | settings and then clicking on the little edit button next to it, because it will allow you         |
| 17:17      | to see like what credit cards can this be autofilling.                                             |
| 17:20      | So if you've got a credit card in there that's expired, for example, and you don't want that       |
| 17:24      | autofilling, like you can go in and unlock, you'll have to, you know, enter a password             |
| 17:30      | to unlock the credit card information and same with the passwords and so on.                       |
| 17:34      | But that is a good way to clear out some of the old dead data that is in there.                    |
| 17:39      | If you have that enabled or if you found that you've got 1Password and you want 1Password      |
| 17:43      | autofilling things or lost password, get water in or whoever, then you can, you know,              |
| 17:50      | just go in and uncheck all of those options and then you won't have competing things               |
| 17:53      | in filling stuff in.                                                                               |
| 17:54      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 17:55      | What you don't want is to have both of them trying to fill at the same time.                       |
| 17:58      | No.                                                                                                |
| 17:59      | No, definitely not.                                                                                |
| 18:00      | At the very minimum, make sure they're different keyboard shortcuts.                               |
| 18:03      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 18:04      | Now, one thing, by default, the search engine of [[Safari]] is Google and there's all sorts            |
| 18:11      | of news stories out there, none of which are really confirmed.                                     |
| 18:14      | But I think they're believable that in order to become the default search engine, there's          |
| 18:20      | money changing hands, you know, which wouldn't surprise me.                                        |
| 18:24      | That certainly used to be the case.                                                                |
| 18:27      | I'm not so sure exactly how that is now.                                                           |
| 18:31      | But what I can say now is, you know, I have my default search engine set to [[DuckDuckGo]].            |
| 18:37      | And I have this for a number of reasons, privacy being one of them.                                |
| 18:39      | The other reason is an automation related reason.                                                  |
| 18:42      | If you ever want to just quickly use something to get somebody the right link, if I do this        |
| 18:47      | in Google, you know, if I search for something using Google and then I right click on that         |
| 18:51      | link in the Google search results and I click copy link and I go in and I paste it wherever        |
| 18:56      | messages, you know, email, whatever, I'm going to get a Google link which will then redirect       |
| 19:02      | them to the search result.                                                                         |
| 19:05      | If I copy the link from [[DuckDuckGo]], I get the link that is the real link.                          |
| 19:09      | It's the end result.                                                                               |
| 19:10      | So if I was searching for Apple, then the Google link would be Google blah blah blah               |
| 19:14      | blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, you know, something very decipherable.                    |
| 19:18      | And then if I copy it from..go, it'll be apple.com, or HTTPS colon, www.apple.com.                 |
| 19:26      | And that is just something that I really like, because it can give somebody the real link.         |
| 19:31      | And the preview that they get will probably look the same, but it means that they don't            |
| 19:36      | have a bunch of tracking being passed on to them from me.                                          |
| 19:40      | And yeah, it's also nice if somebody's just looking at the web address.                            |
| 19:45      | They're not going like, is this person trying to hack me?                                          |
| 19:47      | Is something going wrong here?                                                                     |
| 19:48      | Like, what's up?                                                                                   |
| 19:49      | You know, you can just see that it's the regular web address.                                      |
| 19:52      | And now as we drive by..go, first of all, I agree,..go is my default search engine                 |
| 19:58      | on every platform.                                                                                 |
| 20:01      | There is a thing in..go, which is an automator topic that we could literally drop into a           |
| 20:06      | black hole of an entire episode on called bang modifiers.                                          |
| 20:10      | And that's what I call, I'm not sure what the official name is, but I just looked up               |
| 20:15      | currently there,..go has 13,563 bangs.                                                             |
| 20:20      | And what that is, is it's an exclamation point plus a code that allows you to do searches          |
| 20:26      | directly on other search platforms.                                                                |
| 20:30      | Like if you wanted to do an Amazon search in..go, you just type exclamation point A                |
| 20:37      | and then space and then the search, and you just do that in your search bar.                       |
| 20:40      | You can also put that exclamation mark at the end, because every so often I'll do this.            |
| 20:44      | If I, and I haven't needed to do this in a long time, but every so often I'd search for            |
| 20:49      | something on..go and it wouldn't come back with it.                                                |
| 20:51      | So I'd then put an exclamation mark G at the end, you know, so space exclamation mark              |
| 20:55      | G at the end of my search result, and it would then search Google for that.                        |
| 20:59      | I didn't know that.                                                                                |
| 21:00      | I didn't know that.                                                                                |
| 21:01      | There we go.                                                                                       |
| 21:02      | Well, there we go.                                                                                 |
| 21:03      | We both learned something today, because I didn't realise that an Amazon search was                |
| 21:05      | part of this.                                                                                      |
| 21:06      | I usually use [[Alfred]] to search Amazon, but that's one of those things where you don't              |
| 21:10      | necessarily want to do that.                                                                       |
| 21:12      | And maybe if you're listening, you're saying, but Dave, Rose, I really love Google search.         |
| 21:16      | I think the results are good, and I want to use those sometimes.                                   |
| 21:19      | There's a bang for that.                                                                           |
| 21:21      | Bang G.                                                                                            |
| 21:22      | Yep, exclamation mark G.                                                                           |
| 21:23      | Yep.                                                                                               |
| 21:24      | So.                                                                                                |
| 21:25      | There we go.                                                                                       |
| 21:26      | And Google images bang GI.                                                                         |
| 21:27      | So it's just really easy to, once you get those into your fingers, then that becomes               |
| 21:32      | a feature that using other search engines, you don't get.                                          |
| 21:37      | And it's almost like putting a little version of [[Alfred]] in your search bar.                        |
| 21:41      | I don't know how else to put it, but I've been using that trick over years, and I've got               |
| 21:45      | these now as muscle memory, and I use them all the time.                                           |
| 21:49      | But if you go to the website, I'll put a link in the show notes to their explanation, and          |
| 21:54      | you can see all the different platforms you can search, and pretty much anything you want          |
| 21:59      | to do is in there, and you just kind of memorise that and you're good to go.                       |
| 22:03      | Yes.                                                                                               |
| 22:04      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 22:05      | And, you know, while we're talking about search, there's also the possibility of including         |
| 22:11      | [[Safari]] suggestions, preloading the top hit, showing your favourites, and so on in the,              |
| 22:17      | so when you click into that, it's not just a search bar, it's actually the, I had the              |
| 22:25      | tab open just now, and I've forgotten what it's called.                                            |
| 22:29      | But yeah, it's not just the search bar because it's a search and address bar, but yeah.            |
| 22:36      | And also you can enable a quick website search for certain websites.                               |
| 22:40      | And so you can actually add websites into your search so that you can then search those            |
| 22:46      | websites specifically.                                                                             |
| 22:48      | So yeah, that's some of the nice options that are available there.                                 |
| 22:54      | But there is something else I use, David, because [[Safari]] has reader mode, right?                   |
| 23:00      | And reader mode, it's great because you can just click on it and it'll take something              |
| 23:05      | that's maybe got some weird and wonky formatting.                                                  |
| 23:09      | Because a classic one is a recipe website, right?                                                  |
| 23:12      | You look for a recipe for something, and there's 48 pages of how my grandmother's barn makes       |
| 23:17      | me homesick and I miss my grandmother's barn, and then there's, you know, like a one page          |
| 23:21      | recipe.                                                                                            |
| 23:22      | That there's a bazillion pictures of random stuff that are, you know, essentially ads for          |
| 23:28      | other things on that site, like interspersed in the 48 pages.                                      |
| 23:31      | And if you click on reader mode, usually this stuff goes away, but at the minimum, you're          |
| 23:35      | not going to have the line green text on the future background.                                    |
| 23:38      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 23:39      | You're going to have like white text on a black background or black text on white background       |
| 23:43      | or grays or whatever it is you've got it set to.                                                   |
| 23:46      | So under websites in the [[Safari]] settings, I have a bunch of websites automatically use             |
| 23:50      | reader mode.                                                                                       |
| 23:52      | And this just makes it so much nicer to use.                                                       |
| 23:56      | Now, to set this up, you know, you actually do it on the website.                                  |
| 24:01      | So when you are on the website and you show reader mode, that icon for show reader mode,           |
| 24:07      | if you right click on it, then you can say use reader mode automatically on this website           |
| 24:12      | domain dot whatever.                                                                               |
| 24:15      | And then once you've done that, you know, it will then be available there as an option             |
| 24:20      | for yes, I want to use this automatically and it will, it will just do it.                         |
| 24:25      | And there's similar options for things like autoplay where you can enable and disable autoplay.    |
| 24:33      | And the default for me is actually set to never autoplay, but there is an option for               |
| 24:39      | stop media with sound.                                                                             |
| 24:42      | So that's, that's worth considering.                                                               |
| 24:43      | And similarly, there's options for default page zooms or a website like has this weird             |
| 24:48      | formatting where everything just looks a little bit small and like off to the left, you might      |
| 24:51      | want to zoom in a bit on that and giving things access to screen sharing location, camera,         |
| 24:57      | etc.                                                                                               |
| 24:58      | But yeah, there, there, there's some options there.                                                |
| 25:01      | So if you get notifications from some random website and you're like, where is this coming         |
| 25:04      | from?                                                                                              |
| 25:05      | Like, why do I want this?                                                                          |
| 25:06      | It's, it's, it's going to be on the websites so that you can, you know, disable that if            |
| 25:11      | you, if you want to get rid of those, you know, and be like, no, I, I don't want the               |
| 25:15      | public forum to be able to send me notifications or whatever it is that's doing that.              |
| 25:20      | Sometimes you just have an interest that attracts old web pages like I am, I do a little bit        |
| 25:25      | of woodworking and I love hand tools, but some of the best hand tool reviews were written          |
| 25:30      | in like 1995 web 1.0 and, you know, you, you stumble onto these websites that have just            |
| 25:38      | great information, but you know, this is like always, it's like a black screen with like           |
| 25:42      | gray text on it, super small, you know, doesn't flow, doesn't do anything and you just hit         |
| 25:48      | the reader mode and it just fixes it for you and whatever your interest is, if you bump            |
| 25:53      | into websites like that, you're one button push away from fixing it.                               |
| 25:58      | Let's get back before we move on to tabs, just, you know, navigating and moving tabs,              |
| 26:03      | I think is another nice area of automation.                                                        |
| 26:06      | I think people don't realise that there's a lot you can do with tabs.                              |
| 26:11      | You've already mentioned several of them, but even just like navigating between tabs               |
| 26:16      | with a keyboard, I think is super useful and that's done with the control key.                     |
| 26:22      | So it's control plus tab, the tab key on your keyboard or control plus shift plus tab              |
| 26:28      | key and I find that really just a very easy way when you get a lot of tabs and it's, it's          |
| 26:35      | just so, you know, so unautomated to stop and take the mouse and go up and click when              |
| 26:40      | you can just hit a couple of keyboard shortcuts.                                                   |
| 26:43      | And one of the tricks I did is when I opened [[Safari]], my [[Stream Deck]] plus has that dial             |
| 26:48      | on it and it actually pre-programs the left most dial to use those keyboard shortcuts              |
| 26:53      | so I can just spin the dial if I really want.                                                      |
| 26:55      | I'll let me be honest with you, I still find myself using the keyboard shortcut more than          |
| 26:58      | anything else.                                                                                     |
| 26:59      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 27:00      | I mean, one of the things I actually do is, so I tend to keep the most important tabs              |
| 27:04      | over on the left and the least important tabs on the right.                                        |
| 27:07      | And so that means that the nine most important tabs are going to be command one, command           |
| 27:13      | two, command three, et cetera through to command nine because that is an option in, in [[Safari]].     |
| 27:20      | You know, if, if you look under the tabs, then you can, you can do that.                           |
| 27:23      | And this is also very important because when I right click on a tab, then I get the option         |
| 27:29      | assuming that there is a tab to the right.                                                         |
| 27:32      | It says, you know, you can close tab, close other tabs or close tabs to the right.                 |
| 27:38      | Every so often I've ended up with my window kind of back to front and I've got a bunch             |
| 27:42      | of stuff like on the left side that I want to get rid of.                                          |
| 27:45      | So what you can do then is you can actually press option and then you can close the tabs           |
| 27:50      | to the left.                                                                                       |
| 27:51      | I can't believe how long I didn't know that for because like I use this feature heavily            |
| 27:57      | in Firefox of like closed tabs to the left.                                                        |
| 27:59      | I don't want any of the tabs to the left.                                                          |
| 28:01      | This doesn't, by the way, include pin tabs.                                                        |
| 28:02      | It won't close those pin tabs unless you explicitly go to close them.                              |
| 28:07      | But it's so useful for like, okay, yeah, I just want to like, you know, I want to close            |
| 28:11      | all the tabs to the left of this and just get rid of them done or close the tabs to                |
| 28:14      | the right or close all the other tabs.                                                             |
| 28:18      | Though I have every once in a while, David just moved this tab to a new window and then            |
| 28:22      | close the window to get around that.                                                               |
| 28:25      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 28:26      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 28:27      | But yeah, tab management is a big deal.                                                            |
| 28:29      | I'm actually pretty facetious about that.                                                          |
| 28:31      | I don't like to have 50 tabs open.                                                                 |
| 28:35      | I don't, I just try to keep what I'm working on, but we'll get later to tab groups because         |
| 28:40      | in a way, I'm a violator of my own rule because of tab groups, so we'll get there.                 |
| 28:44      | Yes.                                                                                               |
| 28:45      | Yes, we will.                                                                                      |
| 28:46      | And honestly, you know, having features like that available are really handy.                      |
| 28:51      | And one of the things I do do, if I've got a bunch of windows open and I've ended up               |
| 28:55      | with loads of windows, with loads of [[Safari]] tabs, it's under the window option, merge              |
| 28:59      | all windows, like get all my [[Safari]] windows, jam them into this one.                               |
| 29:04      | We're good.                                                                                        |
| 29:05      | Thanks.                                                                                            |
| 29:06      | You know, so long.                                                                                 |
| 29:07      | Thanks for all the fish windows.                                                                   |
| 29:08      | I don't need you anymore.                                                                          |
| 29:09      | It's really useful.                                                                                |
| 29:10      | On iOS, if you tap and hold on the tab icon, like the one that would create a new tab,             |
| 29:18      | you can also merge all your [[Safari]] windows right there as well.                                    |
| 29:21      | And that is such a useful feature for, you know, my mother's inevitable.                           |
| 29:25      | I had this link open just now, and now it's not open in [[Safari]].                                    |
| 29:29      | Tap and hold on the thing, merge all your windows together, you created another [[Safari]]             |
| 29:32      | window again.                                                                                      |
| 29:34      | And yeah, solves that problem right there.                                                         |
| 29:39      | This episode of the automators is brought to you by ExpressVPN.                                    |
| 29:42      | Go to expressvpn.com/automators for high speed, secure and anonymous VPN services,           |

| 29:52      | Watching Netflix without using ExpressVPN is like playing your favourite game and not               |
| 29:56      | using all the powerups.                                                                            |
| 29:58      | Why limit yourself when there's so much more fun to be had?                                        |
| 30:01      | I don't know if you know this, but some of the streaming services have different content           |
| 30:05      | libraries for every country, so there are tons of shows available in other countries.              |
| 30:10      | And with a VPN, you can access those other libraries.                                              |
| 30:14      | It basically tweaks where Netflix or other services think you are right now.                       |
| 30:18      | The other day I was feeling some nostalgia for Back to the Future.                                 |
| 30:21      | I loved that movie as a kid.                                                                       |
| 30:23      | Well, guess what?                                                                                  |
| 30:24      | It's available on Canadian Netflix.                                                                |
| 30:26      | So I just logged in saying that I was in Canada and I watched Back to the Future with just         |
| 30:31      | one click by opening the app, choosing the country I want Netflix to think I'm in, and             |
| 30:35      | refreshing.                                                                                        |
| 30:36      | And by the way, Back to the Future is still an awesome movie.                                      |
| 30:40      | There are so many reasons to choose ExpressVPN.                                                    |
| 30:42      | First, it has blazing fast speeds.                                                                 |

| 31:05      | You can stop paying full price for streaming services and only getting access to a fraction        |
| 31:10      | of their content.                                                                                  |

| 31:26      | Our thanks to ExpressVPN for their support of the Automators podcast and all of Relay              |
| 31:31      | FM.                                                                                                |
| 31:35      | So something else, David, that I wanted to look at for automation purposes are [[Safari]]              |
| 31:39      | extensions, because I feel like there are some ones that we've talked about before.                |
| 31:45      | One that we've definitely talked about before is OmSave, O-M-S-A-V-E, which is available           |
| 31:50      | in the App Store for a couple of bucks, which allows you to quickly save stuff to OmniFocus       |
| 31:55      | with preferences.                                                                                  |
| 31:57      | And then literally, I just, I click one icon in the menu bar, it's not in the menu bar,            |
| 32:03      | sorry.                                                                                             |
| 32:04      | It's an icon in the address bar area, like near the back button or on the other side,              |
| 32:09      | depending on where you put it.                                                                     |
| 32:11      | And it will pre-populate my [[Safari]], sorry, my OmniFocus quick capture with the information         |
| 32:18      | that I want.                                                                                       |
| 32:20      | But OmSave, you know, lets you do some extra bits in there as well.                                |
| 32:24      | So you can say, okay, but I always want this to go to this project or whatever.                    |
| 32:29      | And that's one of my favourite little [[Safari]] extensions, but there are a whole bunch more           |
| 32:34      | that we can talk about as well.                                                                    |
| 32:36      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 32:37      | I mean, and that one is so automation, right?                                                      |
| 32:40      | Because it's saving you work in terms of your OmniFocus capture.                                   |
| 32:45      | And over the years, like I had been using, you know, OmniFocus has its own automation              |
| 32:50      | where you can assign a service which captures any text into an OmniFocus task.                     |
| 32:56      | And for over the years, I had got the habit of going into the URL bar, you know, and just          |
| 33:02      | grabbing that text and saving it to OmniFocus with that built-in shortcut.                         |
| 33:06      | But OmSave is so much better.                                                                      |
| 33:10      | I mean, this is one that almost needs to be Sherlocked by the Omni Group.                           |
| 33:14      | But it's a great little feature, and I'm with you 100% on that.                                    |
| 33:19      | But there are more.                                                                                |
| 33:20      | There are definitely more.                                                                         |
| 33:21      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 33:22      | There are a whole bunch more.                                                                      |
| 33:23      | And, you know, I'll just go through some of the ones that I use on a regular basis.                |
| 33:28      | And so one of the ones I use is AwesomeScreenshot.                                                 |
| 33:32      | Now if you use the default screenshot options on macOS, I believe this is present now.             |
| 33:40      | And certainly if you take a screenshot on iPadOS or iOS, then you can change the screenshot        |
| 33:46      | after you've taken it in [[Safari]] to say, hey, I want to take a screenshot of the whole web page,     |
| 33:50      | please.                                                                                            |
| 33:51      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 33:52      | And then it'll share it as a PDF.                                                                  |
| 33:53      | This is fine.                                                                                      |
| 33:54      | This is great.                                                                                     |
| 33:55      | But sometimes I need to, like I use CleanShot, and I don't necessarily want to do the scrolling    |
| 34:00      | screenshot thing.                                                                                  |
| 34:01      | So I often use AwesomeScreenshot on macOS.                                                         |
| 34:05      | And what I love about AwesomeScreenshot is it's also available for Firefox and Chrome.             |
| 34:09      | And this can take a screenshot of a whole web page for you so that you can get everything           |
| 34:15      | in one screenshot.                                                                                 |
| 34:16      | And then it doesn't just save as a screenshot, it'll let you like share it or upload it somewhere  |
| 34:20      | and create a link to it or whatever.                                                               |
| 34:22      | So you've got all of your options.                                                                 |
| 34:25      | And that for me is just a very nice and useful tool where I don't have to remember anything        |
| 34:30      | in particular.                                                                                     |
| 34:31      | Again, I can just click on one of those little icons and it'll go away and do its thing.           |
| 34:35      | Another one that I like is the URL linker.                                                         |
| 34:41      | It's just a way to copy your URL and your favourite format.                                         |
| 34:46      | Maybe you turn me on to this one, Rose, but I find I use it all the time.                          |
| 34:50      | So this is Scotty Jackson Special, and he turned me on to it, and then I turned you on to this.    |
| 34:56      | So basically, you can define five formats to save or to copy the web page as.                       |
| 35:08      | And then when you right click on the web page, then you can just copy it as that.                   |
| 35:12      | But what's really cool is you can like, there's percent title and percent URL, okay, title         |
| 35:20      | and URL being uppercase.                                                                           |
| 35:21      | But then you can just put these in any format.                                                     |
| 35:23      | So like the default suggestion is copy as markdown format.                                         |
| 35:27      | They know their audience.                                                                          |
| 35:28      | That's all I'm going to say there.                                                                 |
| 35:30      | They know their audience.                                                                          |
| 35:31      | But the other one that I do is copy is tab space, because that way I get the title tab             |
| 35:36      | URL.                                                                                               |
| 35:37      | And that, for me, is incredibly useful, because then I can paste that into a spreadsheet or        |
| 35:43      | air table, and it will put the title in one column and the URL in the next column.                 |
| 35:47      | And that is great for things like iOS today and so on, so that I can just paste up directly        |
| 35:52      | into the show notes.                                                                               |
| 35:53      | And you can set up five of these.                                                                  |
| 35:55      | And that's just a really useful little, I mean, I'm going to call it, it's almost the              |
| 36:00      | gizmo category of extensions, where it's just like everybody should have one of these.             |
| 36:05      | You know, like, even if you don't necessarily need it right now, like note it down for later       |
| 36:09      | because you'll probably find an occasion where you do want this.                                   |
| 36:13      | And another one that I was going to recommend is one that perhaps it's a little geekier            |
| 36:19      | up on the, you know, recommendation chain.                                                         |
| 36:23      | It's called redirect web.                                                                          |
| 36:25      | So redirect web basically will be, hey, whenever I land on this, this kind of URL, like change     |
| 36:32      | it.                                                                                                |
| 36:33      | So, for example, if I ever get, if I ever get given a Reddit link of www.reddit.com,               |
| 36:39      | it will change this to old.reddit.com, because I prefer the old Reddit interface, not the          |
| 36:44      | new Reddit interface, because I'm apparently just that cranky about the new Reddit interface.      |
| 36:50      | But you can use this for all sorts of things.                                                      |
| 36:51      | You know, if somebody, you know, if I click on the link and it opens, you know, the Rick           |
| 36:55      | roll video on YouTube, then it'll redirect me to a April Fool's image search on [[DuckDuckGo]].        |
| 37:01      | I don't know, whatever it is, but it's very nice for things like that.                             |
| 37:07      | If you ever just want to, you know, have something that opens with a particular kind of URL change |
| 37:13      | to something else, you can do that.                                                                |
| 37:16      | Another one that I would recommend is Downy, which is an app I got through setup, but it           |
| 37:21      | is very automation adjacent, in my opinion, because it allows me to download videos to             |
| 37:26      | watch offline.                                                                                     |
| 37:28      | I'm getting, where I'm getting cranky lately is not about the Reddit interface, it's about         |
| 37:33      | algorithms.                                                                                        |
| 37:34      | I feel like they are so good at distracting me and all of us, frankly, that when I go              |
| 37:41      | on YouTube these days and I see something on a watch, I'll just download it in Downy               |
| 37:44      | and watch it separately and not get stuck into the rabbit hole of endless YouTube videos.          |
| 37:51      | And Downy works for just about anything that you can watch video on the web on, and I really       |
| 37:55      | like it.                                                                                           |
| 37:57      | It's easy enough to put it in as an extension, whereas, you know, doing this manually is not       |
| 38:03      | always even possible, but it certainly isn't easy, and Downy makes it an automatic process.        |
| 38:10      | Yes.                                                                                               |
| 38:11      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                     |
| 38:12      | I really like Downy as well.                                                                       |
| 38:15      | And yeah, as you mentioned, it's part of setup.                                                    |
| 38:18      | Another one that I use, and this is definitely the class of things where, is this a [[Safari]]         |
| 38:25      | automation, or is this a, it uses a Mac automation, because it's a [[Safari]] extension for an app     |
| 38:34      | that you can install on your Mac, which is Choosy.                                                 |
| 38:36      | Now, Choosy lets you say, okay, whenever I open this kind of link, so whenever I open              |
| 38:42      | a link from the [[Slack]] app, I want it to open in this browser.                                      |
| 38:47      | Whenever I open a link containing relay.fm, I want it to open in [[Safari]], whatever it is.           |
| 38:53      | But Choosy also has a [[Safari]] extension and Firefox extension and Chrome extension, etc.            |
| 39:00      | Because then what I can do is I can say, hey, this page that I'm on, open it in this browser       |
| 39:04      | for me, please.                                                                                    |
| 39:06      | And that for me ends up being very useful, because then I can, you know, open any link             |
| 39:10      | in any other browser whenever I want or need to, which, you know, for the odd thing of,            |
| 39:15      | huh, this looks a bit weird, is it just looking weird in this browser, or does it look weird       |
| 39:19      | in that browser as well, is very useful.                                                           |
| 39:22      | It's more so for me useful on the developer side of things, but, you know, it could be             |
| 39:27      | useful for a number of other people.                                                               |
| 39:28      | Now, there are some extensions that deal with dark mode, right, where you've got your Mac          |
| 39:35      | in dark mode and you want websites, because it's really jarring if you're in dark mode             |
| 39:41      | to see a website show up with a white background.                                                  |
| 39:44      | The two that I have been bouncing back and forth between are Dark Reader and Noir.                 |
| 39:50      | And you said Noir, as soon as I mentioned the topic, so tell me why that's the winner              |
| 39:55      | for you.                                                                                           |
| 39:56      | Well, for me, Noir just ends up being the winner because it's installed, it's working,             |
| 40:02      | and I use it.                                                                                      |
| 40:03      | And I also have it set, so, like, with Noir, you can say, like, you know, please, default          |
| 40:09      | websites to being in dark mode when I'm in dark mode, or you can, there are some other             |
| 40:13      | options as well, but you can also say, but not this website, please.                               |
| 40:18      | And that works very well for me, and I really like that, but I haven't got a lot of experience     |
| 40:23      | with Dark Reader, so I'm wondering how you're feeling about that one.                              |
| 40:26      | Well, it's basically the same thing.                                                               |
| 40:29      | The icon sort of looks like Darth Vader, so I like that, you know, but the features are            |
| 40:36      | about the same.                                                                                    |
| 40:37      | I think what I'm going to do is load up Noir and try it, and then I'll report back if there's      |
| 40:42      | any difference.                                                                                    |
| 40:43      | I suspect they're both fully adequate for the job.                                                 |
| 40:46      | How often are you in dark mode on your Mac?                                                        |
| 40:49      | So all of my devices switch to dark mode after sunset, or at sunset, and the other thing           |
| 40:56      | is I do have, whenever I'm in sleep mode, all of my, well, at least my iPhone is definitely        |
| 41:02      | in dark mode.                                                                                      |
| 41:03      | And so, you know, if I'm taking a nap in the afternoon or sleeping late or something,              |
| 41:08      | then, yeah, they'll be in dark mode during that, even if the sun's up.                             |
| 41:13      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 41:14      | The only problem with that is if you record videos after sunset, you've got to switch              |
| 41:18      | it back, but it's not that big of a deal.                                                          |
| 41:20      | Yeah, no.                                                                                          |
| 41:21      | I mean, like when I enter the podcasting focus mode, it checks if I'm recording iOS                |
| 41:26      | today, and if I am, then it puts my phone back to light mode, and then when I end podcasting       |
| 41:31      | focus mode, if my device is in light mode, it checks whether or not the sun's down, and            |
| 41:35      | if it is, then it turns on dark mode again for me.                                                 |
| 41:39      | So, you know, I work around that problem with more automations, but yeah, that, you know,          |
| 41:44      | especially living in the northern hemisphere and not like just like on the equator, but            |
| 41:49      | further north then.                                                                                |
| 41:50      | There's a good chunk of the year where it's fairly dark for me, and yeah, it's nicer to            |
| 41:54      | not have your rut in a seared, especially if you do need to check something, you know,             |
| 41:59      | late in the night, early in the morning, or as I was recently on a plane where, you know,          |
| 42:05      | you know, lights are dimmed because people are supposed to be trying to sleep, having              |
| 42:09      | that person next to you with the phone that's like the eye of Sauron trying to get at you,         |
| 42:13      | you know.                                                                                          |
| 42:14      | It's in dark mode.                                                                                 |
| 42:15      | It's not quite so painful.                                                                         |
| 42:16      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 42:17      | And what I will say is that for folks who haven't tried dark mode in a while, these plugins        |
| 42:22      | are essential because [[Safari]] is like the worst violator, but otherwise, most of the apps           |
| 42:27      | these days on the Mac are good dark mode players, and it really does work.                         |
| 42:32      | When they first released it, it was kind of hit and miss where you'd have a couple, you            |
| 42:36      | know, white background apps anyway, but that's really not the case anymore.                        |
| 42:41      | And while we're on this little side road, how do you trigger dark mode, Rose?                      |
| 42:45      | You're an automator.                                                                               |
| 42:46      | I suspect you've got a fun way of doing it.                                                        |
| 42:48      | I mean, I just use the default settings for turn it on at sunset, please.                          |
| 42:53      | That's pretty much it.                                                                             |
| 42:54      | Other than that, it's the automations I mentioned with, you know, checking if I'm in podcasting    |
| 42:58      | focus mode or sleep focus mode and turning it on or off when those modes are started               |
| 43:03      | and ended as appropriate.                                                                          |
| 43:05      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 43:06      | I use a [[Keyboard Maestro]] shortcut because there is a [[Keyboard Maestro]] action called                |
| 43:11      | toggle dark mode, which is great because then it's just one shortcut that just jumps between       |
| 43:16      | them and I give it the hyper key plus D and I just, you know, I've mapped the hyper key            |
| 43:21      | using [[BetterTouchTool\|BetterTouchTool's]].                                                                          |
| 43:23      | So caps lock plus D and I can switch in between them, which is how I solve the problem of          |
| 43:28      | getting out of dark mode when I need to record.                                                    |
| 43:31      | Fair.                                                                                              |
| 43:32      | That works nicely.                                                                                 |
| 43:33      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 43:34      | I rarely find myself in dark mode when I don't want to be in dark mode on macOS.                   |
| 43:39      | So that works pretty well for me.                                                                  |
| 43:41      | All right.                                                                                         |
| 43:42      | You want to talk about some more?                                                                  |
| 43:43      | I've got a few more here.                                                                          |
| 43:45      | Well, I mean, one I have, it's not exactly an automation tip, but it's definitely a [[Safari]]         |
| 43:50      | tip or, you know, I've got to that and go recommend the [[Safari]] tips rather than specifically       |
| 43:55      | automation ones.                                                                                   |
| 43:57      | Baking soda and vinegar, you know, they make water.                                                |
| 44:00      | They also de-horribilify video in [[Safari]].                                                          |
| 44:07      | So you end up with the nice native video player instead of the YouTube player or the Vimeo         |
| 44:11      | player or the Twitch player or whatever it is.                                                     |
| 44:15      | And so, you know, vinegar works on YouTube, baking soda works on the rest of the internet          |
| 44:20      | for you.                                                                                           |
| 44:22      | And so that's definitely two that I'll recommend for that.                                         |
| 44:25      | And that's also great because it means that those videos have definitely got [[AirPlay]] support       |
| 44:28      | and so on if you want that.                                                                        |
| 44:31      | And then another one I'm going to recommend is Good Links because I love saving links              |
| 44:38      | to read later and being able to just say, like, hey, this is an article.                           |
| 44:44      | I'm going to want to be able to read it later.                                                     |
| 44:46      | And then being able to read that offline later, you know, assuming that I've opened Good Links     |
| 44:49      | on my device is very handy.                                                                        |
| 44:52      | And also Good Links will default to using the reader view, which means that, you know,             |
| 44:56      | I don't have to worry so much about, you know, ads and stuff in those articles.                    |
| 45:02      | So yeah, I use Good Links for that as well.                                                        |
| 45:05      | What about you?                                                                                    |
| 45:06      | Any final recommendations?                                                                         |
| 45:07      | A couple, again, I'm getting kind of off the thread of automation, Grammarly.                      |
| 45:11      | I guess that you could consider that automation.                                                   |
| 45:13      | I'm a fan of the Grammarly Grammar Checker.                                                        |
| 45:17      | I've never had faith in a Grammar Checker in my life, but this one seems to work for               |
| 45:21      | me.                                                                                                |
| 45:22      | I think like a hundred bucks a year and they catch errors in my writing all the time.              |
| 45:27      | They've got a plug-in for [[Safari]], which will monitor as you're filling in text on a web            |
| 45:32      | form, which I think is if you're going to have the service, you might as well use it.              |
| 45:37      | Is that automation?                                                                                |
| 45:38      | I don't know, but it does make your writing better.                                                |
| 45:41      | And then the Readwise apps, I'm a big fan of Readwise and it's a space repetition system           |
| 45:47      | for the stuff I read in Amazon and on the web.                                                     |
| 45:50      | And they now have a reader app, it's still in beta, but they've got plug-ins for that              |
| 45:54      | too.                                                                                               |
| 45:55      | So saving stuff to Readwise, accessing Readwise and saving to their reader is very useful to       |
| 46:00      | me and I use those plug-ins all the time.                                                          |
| 46:03      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 46:04      | I mean, there's plenty of other [[Safari]] plug-ins out there, some of which are more automation       |
| 46:08      | related than others.                                                                               |
| 46:10      | And we'll have to get to shortcuts in a minute, David, because shortcuts, you know, one of         |
| 46:14      | the changes of Mac OS Ventura is shortcuts actually has share sheet support now.                   |
| 46:18      | So when you click on the share icon, then shortcuts that take URLs will actually show              |
| 46:24      | up, you know, other than that, you can also have shortcuts appear in the right click menu          |
| 46:29      | with services and things like that, which can be very nice.                                        |
| 46:34      | And you know, like, are those extensions, yes and no, you know, they're not extensions             |
| 46:39      | that you can go on the Mac App Store and download, but they are certainly things that I use        |
| 46:43      | in [[Safari]].                                                                                         |
| 46:45      | I will also just throw in a quick mention for my ad blocker of choice, which is 1Blocker.        |
| 46:51      | I use that in combination with PiHole for my ad blocking needs around the home.                    |
| 46:57      | And yeah, those work great for me.                                                                 |
| 47:00      | But other than that, you know, I've got plenty of other ways that I'm automating [[Safari]] going      |
| 47:06      | from the outside in, which I guess we'll have to get to after this.                                |

| 49:12      | So as we've talked about automation from inside [[Safari]], let's go outside for a minute.             |
| 49:18      | We have apps we talk about all the time that we use for accomplishing automation and some          |
| 49:23      | of them actually play pretty nicely with [[Safari]].                                                   |
| 49:27      | Let's start with Bunch.                                                                            |
| 49:28      | I know that's an app you use often and Bunch has a bunch of [[Safari]]-related commands in             |
| 49:32      | it.                                                                                                |
| 49:33      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 49:34      | It's grape, it's grape.                                                                            |
| 49:37      | I'm sorry, I'm trying to make a bunch grape joke here.                                             |
| 49:40      | It's not working very well.                                                                        |
| 49:41      | Let's move on from the very not good puns.                                                         |
| 49:45      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 49:46      | But yes, Bunch does have excellent [[Safari]] support.                                                 |
| 49:48      | So what you can do in Bunch is you can open [[Safari]] by typing in your bunch, [[Safari]].                |
| 49:54      | That's it.                                                                                         |
| 49:55      | That opens [[Safari]], people.                                                                         |
| 49:56      | That's all you need.                                                                               |
| 49:57      | The more important you can open up URLs, right?                                                    |
| 49:58      | I mean, that's the...                                                                              |
| 49:59      | Well, that's just it.                                                                              |
| 50:00      | What you can do is a Markdown-style list underneath the word [[Safari]] with a list of URLs, like      |
| 50:07      | one URL per line, it'll just go ahead and open each of those in a tab.                             |
| 50:12      | And that works so darn well for me.                                                                |
| 50:15      | I love it.                                                                                         |
| 50:17      | And for, like, bunches of URLs that I'm going to repeatedly reuse, I actually turn these           |
| 50:23      | into snippets so that then I can say, like, hey, run the automators tabs snippet and things        |
| 50:30      | like that.                                                                                         |
| 50:31      | And that works very well for me.                                                                   |
| 50:33      | And I've emptied this up a little bit with some [[AppleScript]].                                       |
| 50:39      | So what I do with the AppleScript is I have AppleScript open a new web page or a new window,       |
| 50:48      | sorry, brand new window in [[Safari]].                                                                 |
| 50:51      | So it's just a new empty window.                                                                   |
| 50:53      | And then it'll open up one particular web page that I use all the time whenever I am               |
| 50:58      | podcasting, and that is [[DuckDuckGo]].                                                                |
| 51:01      | And so this is just a little AppleScript that opens a new window with [[DuckDuckGo]].                  |
| 51:05      | And so that gets run before any of my tab group sets.                                              |
| 51:09      | And I say tab group sets, I'm not talking [[Safari]] tab groups, I'm just talking about sets           |
| 51:13      | of tabs that I need to open for, you know, automation purposes in bunch.                           |
| 51:19      | So it will first run that AppleScript and then it will open the pages I need.                      |
| 51:25      | So for automators, I'll be, you know, the thanks for our sponsors and the really CMS               |
| 51:29      | so we can save all those good links and our automators base, which works very well for             |
| 51:34      | me.                                                                                                |
| 51:35      | Okay, so let's put a pin in the Apple [[Safari]] tab group feature because there's an automation       |
| 51:40      | ankle to that.                                                                                     |
| 51:41      | We definitely want to talk about.                                                                  |
| 51:42      | But the thing you just mentioned saying use an automation tool outside of [[Safari]] to open           |
| 51:48      | a group of tabs in [[Safari]], I think is the most frequently desired automation from a                |
| 51:55      | outside [[Safari]], like you want [[Safari]] not to just open up, but give you the tabs for your           |
| 51:59      | work project or give you the tabs for your, you know, home banking or whatever thing it            |
| 52:05      | is that you do where you've got a bunch of tabs, you always want to open it repeatedly.            |
| 52:10      | And let's just take that one on kind of from a macro standpoint, bunch is one of the easiest       |
| 52:16      | ways to do it.                                                                                     |
| 52:17      | Like Rose said, you put, you call [[Safari]] with the term [[Safari]] and then you put markdown            |
| 52:22      | links underneath and you're good and it opens them for you.                                        |
| 52:26      | The other apps that do this that I use are shortcuts, which has an open [[Safari]], which              |
| 52:32      | has basically a, you can add URLs to that command in, in shortcuts.                                |
| 52:40      | And I find that completely stable and works and I don't have a problem.                            |
| 52:44      | It opens each one in a new tab and keyboard, my show has a similar command where you can           |
| 52:50      | open a URL in [[Safari]] and you can give it a list or you can open them one at a time.                |
| 52:56      | It's a little more granular with keyboard, my show, but I find, frankly, shortcuts is              |
| 53:01      | perfectly adequate at doing this.                                                                  |
| 53:03      | The advantage for me doing in shortcuts is that I can run it on any device here.                   |
| 53:09      | I can run it on iOS, iPad or Mac.                                                                  |
| 53:12      | But all three of these are great solutions for opening a group of tabs to do something.            |
| 53:18      | And we're going to do a show, we've got it in the outline list of how we do setups,                |
| 53:23      | but that's a piece of it for me because so often part of my work is opening a group of             |
| 53:28      | tabs that are related to something I'm working on.                                                 |
| 53:31      | And I think anybody that's listening to this that wants to get better at automating the            |
| 53:37      | browser, [[Safari]] or any browser, frankly, should figure out the best way for them to open tabs      |
| 53:44      | because it's a beautiful little automation that's really easy to put together and every            |
| 53:52      | time you do it, you get that payback of the time saved, like the first time you run it             |
| 53:58      | in terms of the reliability and the speed, you'll smile every time you push that button            |
| 54:04      | because no longer will you be hunting and pecking through lists of bookmarks or typing             |
| 54:11      | things in.                                                                                         |
| 54:12      | Well, I mean, that's one of the things, you know, I use this at work all the time because          |
| 54:15      | we have technical reviews of the things that we're going to be creating code for and implementing, |
| 54:20      | which is, you know, a great thing that we should do.                                               |
| 54:23      | And we recently added a new tool to this for, you know, helping us review things and getting       |
| 54:29      | more of a, you know, it's just an easier way for us to all communicate the data in a way           |
| 54:34      | that everyone's going to be able to see it and we can run from this back to it.                    |
| 54:36      | And so we added Figma as a tool for this.                                                          |
| 54:39      | So now when I go to do the review, I, you know, I need to open not just, you know, the             |
| 54:45      | list of the stories for the sprint and, you know, also be aware of, you know, other things         |
| 54:50      | that have previously been done similar to that or future things that will be done related          |
| 54:55      | to that, which, you know, I have.                                                                  |
| 54:59      | But then I also need to open Figma.                                                                |
| 55:01      | So I just literally just added Figma to this and boom, you know, that's it, it's done.             |
| 55:07      | And I have to say what the advantage is a bunch as well as if I do change my browser,              |
| 55:11      | I can literally just go change the word [[Safari]] for [[Safari]] technology preview.                      |
| 55:15      | And yeah, that's it kind of done, you know, yeah, um, you know, it's one of those things           |
| 55:22      | that do, do I want to change this?                                                                 |
| 55:23      | No, I don't necessarily have any intention of changing this, but, you know, the fact               |
| 55:27      | that I could, if I wanted to, um, is definitely, uh, you know, an appealing factor.                |
| 55:33      | Um, and, you know, hopefully at some point, if we get better tab group support and other           |
| 55:37      | automation things, then, um, you know, just like a bunch can open different Chrome profiles,       |
| 55:43      | maybe, you know, it can also open things in particular [[Safari]] tab groups that will be              |
| 55:47      | really cool, assuming that, you know, Apple give, you know, the support, uh, for this              |
| 55:55      | because right now that's kind of missing, but, uh, yeah, just to, just to continue on              |
| 55:59      | obviously, um, you know, [[Keyboard Maestro]] also has some great integration options.                 |
| 56:04      | Um, and one of the things that I do, um, which, you know, maybe, maybe this is over the top        |
| 56:11      | and nerdy, maybe this isn't, um, but I actually have an automators, um, [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro,    |
| 56:18      | which will activate in this case, it's actually activating edge, but the same principle will       |
| 56:21      | would apply with [[Safari]], but it can activate a specific application and like then in it            |
| 56:26      | can bring a window containing a particular title to the front and this is really useful            |
| 56:32      | for doing things like podcast recording because it can be like, Hey, like the [[Safari]] window        |
| 56:36      | that contains this title is the thing that I need to activate when I press this button             |
| 56:41      | or this keyboard shortcut or whatever it is.                                                       |
| 56:43      | And that can be very, very handy when you do have, you know, a bunch of different windows          |
| 56:47      | hanging around.                                                                                    |
| 56:48      | But on top of that, you know, [[Keyboard Maestro]] has a whole bunch, I mean, [[Keyboard Maestro]]         |
| 56:53      | always does, right, but it has a whole bunch of things like, Hey, set the [[Safari]] URL to            |
| 56:57      | this, like this [[Safari]] tab, uh, go open the next [[Safari]] tab or new [[Safari]] tab or new [[Safari]]        |
| 57:02      | window or wait for [[Safari]] to finish loading and focus this field, um, or, you know, set            |
| 57:10      | this field to this text or set this checkbox and submit the form, you know, like it's,             |
| 57:16      | it's kind of crazy, like in a very good way just to be clear, um, but yeah, and it can             |
| 57:20      | even execute JavaScript in [[Safari]], which if you're going, wait, what?                              |
| 57:25      | Bookmarklet just like, you know, um, shortcuts can run, um, JavaScript on a web page in [[Safari]].     |
| 57:31      | That's a bookmarklet and [[Keyboard Maestro]] can do the same thing.                                   |
| 57:35      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 57:36      | And, and that is, you know, where you go next level with it.                                       |
| 57:39      | I mean, starting is opening a group of tabs and then beyond that is having it operate              |
| 57:44      | on those tabs.                                                                                     |
| 57:45      | And that's where I think a tool like [[Keyboard Maestro]] and AppleScript become kind of essential    |
| 57:50      | because that, that's what you need to like go to that next level.                                  |
| 57:53      | Um, and I do want to talk about tab groups, let's, let's hold off on that because I think          |
| 57:58      | for a lot of people, especially right now as things stand, um, opening them through traditional    |
| 58:05      | automation means like a bunch shortcut or [[Keyboard Maestro]] is frankly the best way, but there's    |
| 58:10      | pieces of this.                                                                                    |
| 58:11      | Like one of the things Rose did that I thought was really smart is she runs an AppleScript        |
| 58:15      | to open essentially a new window and that way this tab group you open has a distinct               |
| 58:21      | place that exists in, um, another way you could do that is you could close your [[Safari]]             |
| 58:27      | window via automation, which you can do in shortcuts and, and [[Keyboard Maestro]], I'm not,           |
| 58:32      | I think you could do it.                                                                           |
| 58:33      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 58:34      | You could do it in bunch too.                                                                      |
| 58:35      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 58:36      | I mean, you can do that.                                                                           |
| 58:37      | So the reason why I specifically open a new window and then I open the existing tabs is            |
| 58:41      | because I often have windows open of stuff that I am currently doing or that are for               |
| 58:47      | the next thing that I will be doing and I don't want to close those and lose that.                 |
| 58:51      | Now I could save all those tabs to a tab group or something like that, um, which is fine.          |
| 58:57      | That's one way of doing it, but instead I usually minimise my existing [[Safari]] windows.             |
| 59:02      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 59:03      | Um, and then I open a new one and I just open the tabs that I need and that's it.                  |
| 59:07      | Um, and by the way, when you open a new [[Safari]] window, it has to have a tab, which is why,         |
| 59:12      | you know, for me, it'll be the start page, but that's why I will use AppleScript specifically     |
| 59:17      | to open it with the URL for Dr. Go because that way it's not opening my start page.                |
| 59:22      | And then, you know, if I want to get rid of that, because I activate it using command              |
| 59:25      | one, um, which you can, you can execute through anything, um, then, um, yeah, then I can,          |
| 59:31      | then I can just use command W to close that [[Safari]] tab, um, and then just have the tabs            |
| 59:35      | I need.                                                                                            |
| 59:36      | And it's not a wasted tab in essence, but, but you do need to address that problem.                |
| 59:42      | When you started to start doing this, is do you want these tabs to just lump onto whatever's       |
| 59:47      | currently in [[Safari]], or do you want to open a new window?                                          |
| 59:51      | Do you want to close and reopen from fresh?                                                        |
| 59:54      | You need to kind of come up with a solution for that.                                              |
| 59:56      | And all of that stuff is, is fairly easy, but it's a problem you need to think through             |
| 01:00:01   | when you're starting.                                                                              |
| 01:00:03   | And, um, uh, but it, it's not that difficult and, and this stuff, once you get rolling             |
| 01:00:08   | with it is, is really useful.                                                                      |
| 01:00:10   | I feel like shortcuts support for [[Safari]]s actually pretty robust.                                  |
| 01:00:14   | You know, there are points where shortcuts does good and other points where it falls               |
| 01:00:18   | down.                                                                                              |
| 01:00:19   | There's one huge gaping problem, which we're going to talk about when we get to talking            |
| 01:00:23   | about tab groups, um, but the, uh, in general, I feel like the Apple's done a pretty good          |
| 01:00:28   | job of giving us a nice set of tools to, uh, to automate [[Safari]] with other than opening            |
| 01:00:34   | tabs.                                                                                              |
| 01:00:35   | What other things do you do with shortcuts in [[Safari]]?                                              |
| 01:00:38   | Well, not necessarily specifically with shortcuts, but one of the things that I do do is, you      |
| 01:00:43   | know, I make a point of closing, um, [[Safari]] windows, um, when, um, I'm done with things.           |
| 01:00:50   | Um, and usually what will happen is, you know, it'll prompt me to close, um, you know, that        |
| 01:00:55   | window and then that actually, uh, runs, um, I think, I can't remember.                            |
| 01:01:00   | I thought it was a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro, but I'm now not seeing my [[Keyboard Maestro]]              |
| 01:01:03   | macro for this.                                                                                    |
| 01:01:04   | So maybe it wasn't that, um, but something I do have [[Keyboard Maestro]] do with [[Safari]] specifically  |
| 01:01:10   | is command Q dangerously close to command W. Yeah, number of times we have quit [[Safari]]             |
| 01:01:17   | instead of closing a tab is just too many.                                                         |
| 01:01:21   | So I have a [[Safari]], well, I have an action group in, or a macro group, sorry, in, um,              |
| 01:01:27   | in, um, [[Keyboard Maestro]], which is enabled in [[Safari]] and [[Safari Technology Preview]].                |
| 01:01:31   | And whenever I hit command Q, it'll just pop up and say, Hey, did you mean to close this           |
| 01:01:39   | current application name?                                                                          |
| 01:01:41   | If I say, and it moves that to the centre and if I say, yes, it quits it.                          |
| 01:01:45   | If I say, no, it doesn't quit it and that's it.                                                    |
| 01:01:48   | Um, and it's very, very, very simple.                                                              |
| 01:01:51   | Um, it works exceptionally well, um, but that, that, that just does the thing that I need          |
| 01:01:57   | to do, which means I don't accidentally quit [[Safari]] when I'm not trying to quit [[Safari]].            |
| 01:02:02   | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 01:02:03   | Some of the other, uh, shortcuts actions that I think could be useful if you want to automate      |
| 01:02:07   | [[Safari]].                                                                                            |
| 01:02:08   | We talked earlier about duck, duck, go bang searches.                                              |
| 01:02:11   | You could make a cool little choose from menu, um, search for, uh, that using shortcuts            |
| 01:02:19   | because there is a command to search a note that by default, it said to search Google,             |
| 01:02:24   | but you could say, um, um, you know, pick a platform.                                              |
| 01:02:27   | I mean, the better way to do this, honestly, would be just remember what the bangs are.            |
| 01:02:30   | But if you can't, if you have some obscure ones, you just have it search, duck, duck,              |
| 01:02:34   | go and then have the shortcut insert the bang short term in front of whatever your search          |
| 01:02:41   | term is and it'll run that for you and duck, duck, go and get your result.                         |
| 01:02:45   | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 01:02:46   | I mean, I would actually, you said choose from menu.                                               |
| 01:02:48   | Um, I'm just going to dump a little short cuts pro tip in there for folks.                         |
| 01:02:52   | I would actually use a dictionary.                                                                 |
| 01:02:53   | So then you've got like the name of whatever it is you're searching and then the, the value        |
| 01:02:57   | is the text and then you can just choose from list and then it will give you like the pretty       |
| 01:03:01   | names and it'll show you the, you know, what it is that you're actually getting underneath         |
| 01:03:05   | that.                                                                                              |
| 01:03:06   | Um, and then, um, you know, you don't have to, you know, have a menu with text, um, and            |
| 01:03:12   | your menu names, which is a little more efficient and just, you know, useful to, to know that.     |
| 01:03:17   | That's more elegant.                                                                               |
| 01:03:18   | I gold star for Rosemary Orchard.                                                                  |
| 01:03:21   | And then there's some out there that allow you to pull details from web page or contents            |
| 01:03:26   | from web pages and I find those really useful for me when I see things I want to do further        |
| 01:03:32   | research on, like, um, pulling information off the web and dumping into a craft note               |
| 01:03:37   | or something.                                                                                      |
| 01:03:38   | Um, there's a lot of really good features in there that are [[Safari]] specific.                       |
| 01:03:43   | If you want to use shortcuts to, to get more out of your browser.                                  |
| 01:03:47   | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 01:03:48   | So one of the things I actually use specifically the get details of [[Safari]] web page for is,         |
| 01:03:53   | um, I use good links for saving things for later.                                                  |
| 01:03:56   | Um, and this was, um, a decision that I made.                                                      |
| 01:03:59   | Um, I had previously used Instapaper and pocket and I flip flop back and forth between them,       |
| 01:04:03   | but I decided that I wanted to go with good links.                                                 |
| 01:04:06   | The only downside of good links is because it's using cloud kit for sync, which is great.          |
| 01:04:10   | Um, I love that.                                                                                   |
| 01:04:12   | It doesn't have an API.                                                                            |
| 01:04:14   | So I can't say, Hey, whenever I start an article in my RSS reader, save it to good links, but      |
| 01:04:20   | I can because I use push cut.                                                                      |
| 01:04:24   | Um, now for disclosure, I am, you know, part of the team that helps develop push cut.              |
| 01:04:28   | Um, uh, but, um, what I do is I have my push cut automation server, which is the knife             |
| 01:04:33   | for mini sitting right here next to me at the moment as I record it sits in my office.             |
| 01:04:36   | Um, and then what I can do is say, Hey, whenever an article is started in my RSS reader, I         |
| 01:04:42   | tell my push cut automation server to run my save to good links shortcut with this URL.            |
| 01:04:47   | So take the URL, it'll get the, uh, you know, get some details of it, saves it into good           |
| 01:04:52   | links and that's it moves on its merry way.                                                        |
| 01:04:55   | And so I still have full integration with, you know, all of the other things and it's              |
| 01:05:00   | using the [[Safari]] actions in, um, shortcuts to do that.                                             |
| 01:05:04   | So that works really nicely for me.                                                                |
| 01:05:06   | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 01:05:07   | And then like kind of next level of this is going to keyboard my show.                             |
| 01:05:11   | If you want to perform actions on pages, I mean, I've talked about Grammarly already               |
| 01:05:16   | in this episode, but I prefer the Grammarly web browser to their native Mac app, which             |
| 01:05:21   | is pretty bad.                                                                                     |
| 01:05:23   | And so I've just got a shortcut that opens up, actually, I don't use it anymore because            |
| 01:05:27   | I found a URL that gets me a new blank Grammarly documents, so I can just open that and paste      |
| 01:05:32   | into it.                                                                                           |
| 01:05:33   | But before I had to click a specific button on the screen to get a new one started.                |
| 01:05:38   | And, um, that's the kind of stuff where, you know, kind of Keyboard Maestro's muscle               |
| 01:05:42   | shows up.                                                                                          |
| 01:05:43   | And if you want to perform a specific action on a web page, uh, [[Keyboard Maestro]] might             |
| 01:05:48   | be your, uh, your tool of last resort there to get you over that last mile.                        |
| 01:05:55   | Yes.                                                                                               |
| 01:05:56   | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 01:05:57   | Though for anybody looking for something like that, I'd also encourage you to try searching        |
| 01:06:01   | for a bookmarklet because there's almost certainly going to be somebody out there who's had the    |
| 01:06:05   | same problem before and there'll be a little piece of code that you can look at and hopefully      |
| 01:06:09   | there'll be some nice comments on it from other people saying that they've used it and             |
| 01:06:12   | it works fine.                                                                                     |
| 01:06:13   | So you actually know that it does do what you think it does.                                       |
| 01:06:16   | Um, you know, the downside is you are running code in your browser, um, but the upside is,         |
| 01:06:21   | you know, then this, this can work in any browser, including on iOS, um, because I recently        |
| 01:06:26   | had, uh, too many saved items or safe for later items in my Amazon basket.                         |
| 01:06:30   | Um, and it was just one of those things where I was like, I'm running into the problem of          |
| 01:06:33   | I can't find the things that I've definitely wanting to get later because I had too many           |
| 01:06:36   | things safe for later.                                                                             |
| 01:06:38   | Um, and, uh, so yeah, I added the things I definitely wanted to say for later, like                |
| 01:06:43   | actively say for later into my, move them back to my regular basket and then used a                |
| 01:06:47   | little, uh, bookmarklet to get rid of all of the things from my safe for later section.            |
| 01:06:52   | And that solved that problem very nicely.                                                          |
| 01:06:54   | And we talk about the find and click on image feature and keyboard master every two or three       |
| 01:06:59   | shows here because it's just such a, an excellent automation tool, but it really is the tool       |
| 01:07:05   | of last resort because when you're asking the computer to find an image on the screen              |
| 01:07:11   | and click it automatically, there, there's always things that can go wrong.                        |
| 01:07:16   | You know, a code based automation is way more reliable, but you know, sometimes you've             |
| 01:07:22   | got to do it and it's there for you when you need it.                                              |
| 01:07:24   | You say that David.                                                                                |
| 01:07:25   | So I recently, I have a little bookmarklet that I use at work, um, we use is your DevOps           |
| 01:07:31   | and basically I click it and it would take bits of information off the page and give               |
| 01:07:34   | me a little pop up with an alert so I could copy some information out of it.                       |
| 01:07:38   | Um, uh, so that I had the stuff that I needed in the right format so that I could just copy        |
| 01:07:44   | one thing and be done with it and move on with my life.                                            |
| 01:07:46   | And, um, it stopped working after Christmas and I was like, well, this was working before          |
| 01:07:50   | Christmas.                                                                                         |
| 01:07:51   | I know I took a little bit of a break over Christmas, but I didn't realise that things             |
| 01:07:53   | had changed that much.                                                                             |
| 01:07:54   | Everything looks the same.                                                                         |
| 01:07:56   | And I did some digging and found out that they removed the IDs that I'd used as I created          |
| 01:08:00   | that bookmarklet.                                                                                  |
| 01:08:01   | So it was like, nothing, nothing's perfect, nothing is, uh, guaranteed to work even if             |
| 01:08:04   | it's code.                                                                                         |
| 01:08:05   | Um, but, you know, I was able to fix that pretty easily, fortunately, but it was just              |
| 01:08:08   | one of those things where I was like, why isn't this working?                                      |
| 01:08:11   | And if I've been using, you know, click it image, um, to click at the various things               |
| 01:08:15   | and copy it and paste it, um, then, you know, it would have, it would have kept working.           |
| 01:08:20   | So yeah, when some lose some on that.                                                              |

| 01:10:07   | David, I feel like we've danced around TAB groups, can we dance with TAB groups?                   |
| 01:10:14   | We can.                                                                                            |
| 01:10:15   | I do love TAB groups.                                                                              |
| 01:10:19   | They're pretty awesome.                                                                            |
| 01:10:20   | TAB groups are a feature Apple added, I believe two years ago now, where it solves the problem     |
| 01:10:27   | we were talking about in the last segment of opening up a group of tabs to do a specific           |
| 01:10:30   | task and then you can have them and you can just jump between them with a click of the             |
| 01:10:36   | mouse on the Mac or a selection on the iPhone and iPad.                                            |
| 01:10:40   | I find I really like TAB groups.                                                                   |
| 01:10:44   | I've gone so deep on them.                                                                         |
| 01:10:47   | If I look now, I've got about 25 of them and they come and go.                                     |
| 01:10:52   | Some of them are like, I have one for my car now.                                                  |
| 01:10:55   | We got a new car.                                                                                  |
| 01:10:56   | I've got a bunch of tabs related to that car as we're still trying to figure it all out.           |
| 01:11:01   | I've got some related to very specific things that I'm constantly and I've got one called          |
| 01:11:05   | Automator's Recording Plan.                                                                        |
| 01:11:08   | I've got one called Automator's Ad Recording, so one called Automator's Publication, which         |
| 01:11:12   | is three different TAB groups related to this podcast that I do in three different contexts.       |
| 01:11:18   | Any time I want, I click on one of those and it just opens them up for me, gives me exactly        |
| 01:11:22   | what I want.                                                                                       |
| 01:11:24   | I love them, but then there is a but.                                                              |
| 01:11:29   | Apple hasn't got its Automation Act together fully with this stuff yet.                            |
| 01:11:33   | No, the thing that for me is missing straight off the bat is reset my TAB group.                   |
| 01:11:38   | I want to be able to reset my TAB group back to just those tabs that I had when I started,         |
| 01:11:45   | because my TAB group is actually something that this is the basis and then I'm going               |
| 01:11:49   | to open other things as we go.                                                                     |
| 01:11:51   | As we're recording Automator's, I'm opening links to the bunch documentation on opening            |
| 01:11:56   | web pages and things like that so I can put the links in the show notes.                           |
| 01:11:59   | I do my best to close those and clean up as we go, but there's more than one reason why            |
| 01:12:04   | I'm not using TAB groups for this.                                                                 |
| 01:12:08   | It's just one of those things where it's a little sad that I can't do everything that              |
| 01:12:14   | I wanted to with this, but also this is the automation team maybe have yet to get their            |
| 01:12:20   | hands on this.                                                                                     |
| 01:12:21   | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 01:12:22   | I think I call that TAB pollution when you have a group and then suddenly there's other            |
| 01:12:26   | things in it, or maybe you get a phone call and then you go off on some other wild tangent         |
| 01:12:31   | during the phone call to answer a question, and then you've got this additional TAB in             |
| 01:12:37   | this group that doesn't belong there and it's just kind of a roadblock.                            |
| 01:12:41   | What Rose is saying, wouldn't it be great if I could push a button and it went back                |
| 01:12:44   | to the five basic tabs that I always wanted in this TAB group and got rid of everything            |
| 01:12:48   | else?                                                                                              |
| 01:12:50   | I think that's something we need.                                                                  |
| 01:12:52   | The other thing that just drives me nuts is there's a shortcuts action on iPhone and               |
| 01:12:57   | iPad to open a TAB group.                                                                          |
| 01:13:00   | Great, right?                                                                                      |
| 01:13:01   | I'm on my iPad.                                                                                    |
| 01:13:02   | I can do what I would call a setup to start getting ready to research for the Automator's          |
| 01:13:09   | podcast.                                                                                           |
| 01:13:10   | It opens up a TAB group as part of that, sets a timer, does all that cool stuff.                   |
| 01:13:15   | Go over to my Mac, open up the [[Safari]] action list, and guess what?                                 |
| 01:13:19   | There's not an action for a TAB group.                                                             |
| 01:13:22   | That is the brick wall I smash into with TAB groups on a daily basis.                              |
| 01:13:28   | I want this stuff automated.                                                                       |
| 01:13:30   | I don't want to be opening up the left tab and mousing over and all that nonsense.                 |
| 01:13:35   | I'm an Automator.                                                                                  |
| 01:13:36   | I don't need to do that stuff.                                                                     |
| 01:13:39   | It just doesn't have it.                                                                           |
| 01:13:41   | The only way I can get around it is a [[Keyboard Maestro]] action using the find and click on          |
| 01:13:46   | image that I just told you about.                                                                  |
| 01:13:50   | The trick to that is, and there are tricks to it, because first of all, the left sidebar           |
| 01:13:55   | has to be open for it to find the image.                                                           |
| 01:13:59   | You can have it toggle that, but it may toggle it off.                                             |
| 01:14:01   | The other thing is sometimes if the TAB group is already selected, it's got a different            |
| 01:14:05   | background colour than it does if it isn't selected.                                                |
| 01:14:08   | There are ways to program around this stuff at the [[Keyboard Maestro]], but the more times            |
| 01:14:16   | you have to deal with those contingencies, the less stable it gets.                                |
| 01:14:20   | The action already exists on the iPhone, the iPad, so it's like, why isn't it there?               |
| 01:14:25   | Yes.                                                                                               |
| 01:14:26   | I think it's just one of those things where mail on iOS and Mac are clearly different              |
| 01:14:32   | apps.                                                                                              |
| 01:14:33   | [[Safari]] on iOS and Mac are clearly different apps, whereas [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] and notes and so on,           |
| 01:14:39   | they seem to have consolidated everything and brought that all together.                           |
| 01:14:43   | We're not there yet with mail and [[Safari]], and that's not a complaint for the mail team             |
| 01:14:48   | or the [[Safari]] team, or if you want those to stay separate, then I'm not saying that they           |
| 01:14:54   | shouldn't still be the super powerful apps they are, but I really think it would be beneficial     |
| 01:14:58   | to everybody if somebody sat down with the teams and was like, hey, so you know these              |
| 01:15:03   | [[Safari]] actions, let's just get them all in everywhere.                                             |
| 01:15:06   | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 01:15:07   | Come on.                                                                                           |
| 01:15:08   | Everything, everywhere, please.                                                                    |
| 01:15:09   | Automation parity.                                                                                 |
| 01:15:10   | That's what I want.                                                                                |
| 01:15:11   | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 01:15:12   | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 01:15:13   | I mean, that's not just what we want, that's what we need, because we shouldn't have to            |
| 01:15:18   | be going through, oh, so if this is a Mac, then I want to run a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro.            |
| 01:15:24   | If this is an iPhone or an iPad, then I want to do this, and if this is an Apple Watch,            |
| 01:15:28   | how on earth did this start running in the first place?                                            |
| 01:15:30   | I just want to exit, and it gets very frustrating when you're trying to deal with all that.        |
| 01:15:35   | Honestly, if they get it sorted out, I mean, we're recording this just a little bit before         |
| 01:15:40   | June, maybe this year, we'll get an update to [[Safari]] and shortcuts and fixes.                      |
| 01:15:46   | I could see myself kind of abandoning all of these complicated automations I put together          |
| 01:15:51   | over the years and just going to this, because it's been absolutely reliable.                      |
| 01:15:56   | The stuff I leave in a tab stays in the tab.                                                       |
| 01:15:59   | I think it's really a nice solution that people who don't listen to the automators podcast         |
| 01:16:05   | can take advantage of, but if you give us the automation hook, the automators can take             |
| 01:16:10   | advantage of it too, and I would really like to see that come to fruition this year.               |
| 01:16:17   | It's been long enough.                                                                             |
| 01:16:18   | Yes.                                                                                               |
| 01:16:19   | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                     |
| 01:16:20   | It's not like anybody is saying we hate tab groups.                                                |
| 01:16:22   | I love tab groups, but it would be very nice to have a little bit more control and so on           |
| 01:16:26   | over them so that I can reset them.                                                                |
| 01:16:28   | I can say, hey, this tab group just has these tabs in and so on.                                   |
| 01:16:32   | Right click and close, tabs to the right and tabs to the left can be very useful within            |
| 01:16:37   | tab groups so that I can get things back to the basics, assuming that all the important            |
| 01:16:44   | things are on the left or on the right as needed, but it's still just another thing                |
| 01:16:49   | that's just kind of on top of everything that maybe is not necessarily quite what anybody          |
| 01:16:54   | wanted.                                                                                            |
| 01:16:55   | You know what would be interesting feature in tab groups is the idea of pinning a tab              |
| 01:17:00   | or locking a tab to say, in this tab group, these tabs are always available.                       |
| 01:17:06   | Yeah, because we do have pin tabs, and honestly, that's kind of how I work around this when        |
| 01:17:11   | I'm using them to an extent of I'll pin the most important tabs, and then everything else,         |
| 01:17:18   | just close all the tabs, and I've still got the pin tabs.                                          |
| 01:17:20   | It doesn't always work perfectly, but it works fairly well.                                        |
| 01:17:22   | Yeah, but the problem with pin tabs is they show up everywhere.                                    |
| 01:17:25   | Now, if you could have contextual pin tabs, like if I'm in this tab group, these are               |
| 01:17:30   | the pin tabs.                                                                                      |
| 01:17:31   | If I'm in that tab group, those are the pin tabs, something like that would be really              |
| 01:17:35   | a nice solution, and then it'd be very easy to see the kind of junk tabs that get added            |
| 01:17:41   | as you're doing the project and make it really easy to clear those out, and then kind of reset     |
| 01:17:45   | it, like you were saying.                                                                          |
| 01:17:49   | Apple just give me and Rose a day up there to talk to a couple of engineers, but we'll             |
| 01:17:52   | sort it out for you, no problem.                                                                   |
| 01:17:54   | I think, David, you've just made me realise I've had a [[Safari]] bug every once in a while            |
| 01:17:58   | where a tab can't be moved to another window, like it kind of duplicates itself into the           |
| 01:18:04   | two windows, but then if I activate it and one, it deactivates it in another, I think              |
| 01:18:08   | you've just made me realise how that happened is due to pin tabs, and I'm going to see if          |
| 01:18:11   | I can replicate that later and finally file that bug report with the detail it needs,              |
| 01:18:15   | because sometimes [[Safari]] goes weird is not a good bug report.                                      |
| 01:18:19   | I don't use the pin feature that often, but when it first released, I used it more, but            |
| 01:18:25   | now I prefer to use automation to generate tabs for me or use tab groups themselves.               |
| 01:18:31   | I feel like I'm being too negative on the tab groups.                                              |
| 01:18:34   | It is a great feature, and it's so close, but it just needs a bit more.                            |
| 01:18:39   | In particular, I use it when it's like, oh, actually, I'm going to go over to another              |
| 01:18:43   | machine now, and I kind of want pretty much all of this stuff, so I'll stick everything            |
| 01:18:47   | in a tab group, and then I can go to the other machine and open all of the tabs at the same        |
| 01:18:52   | time in the window over there, and then I don't have to worry.                                     |
| 01:18:57   | I can get the individual tabs one at a time over from another machine, but this is just            |
| 01:19:03   | a nice way of being like, hey, send all these over, please, being done with them.                  |
| 01:19:08   | All right, I want to switch topics real quick.                                                     |
| 01:19:10   | There is a little bit of a white whale in my life.                                                 |
| 01:19:13   | I have the MacSparky Labs, and I've had several members write me and ask me to make a video        |
| 01:19:18   | explaining how to automatically download credit card statements in [[Safari]].                         |
| 01:19:24   | I've done various experiments on this and never been happy with the solutions I come               |
| 01:19:29   | up with, and one of the big things is this is financial information.                               |
| 01:19:32   | You've got to authenticate into these websites, and a lot of them have different formats as        |
| 01:19:37   | to how to download the statements, and honestly, the time I spend chasing this, I feel like        |
| 01:19:43   | isn't worth it.                                                                                    |
| 01:19:45   | This is something where I almost feel like it's easier just to manually go in and download         |
| 01:19:48   | them every few months, and maybe this isn't something that you should be automating.               |
| 01:19:54   | But I wanted to talk to the pro rows and see what your thoughts are on it.                         |
| 01:19:58   | I mean, honestly, my instinct with this is if you don't know how to write the code to              |
| 01:20:02   | write something that can just log in and do this for you, you shouldn't be doing this.             |
| 01:20:07   | Even if you do know how to write it, then hopefully you also know enough about security            |
| 01:20:10   | to realise why this is not necessarily a great idea.                                               |
| 01:20:13   | My concern with any automation related to this is not just the automation that's going             |
| 01:20:18   | to do this, but it's also the bank's own security of, huh, this thing's automatically...           |
| 01:20:26   | This is happening at exactly 3.11 a.m. every first Saturday of the month.                          |
| 01:20:33   | Interesting, because banks do watch out for stuff like that they should do, at least I             |
| 01:20:38   | sincerely hope that all the banks that everybody listening to this is using is doing stuff         |
| 01:20:42   | like that.                                                                                         |
| 01:20:43   | And so you've got both the security of like, well, these details are being stored in a             |
| 01:20:47   | thing that's going off and automatically doing this.                                               |
| 01:20:50   | And also the other side of it where the bank is watching what happens with an account and          |
| 01:20:55   | going, this looks like suspicious activity, like somebody's being hacked or something,             |
| 01:20:59   | even if it's just downloading a credit card statement that still has information on that           |
| 01:21:03   | is private and personal.                                                                           |
| 01:21:06   | So what I would honestly do if you really want to automate this, I do two automations.             |
| 01:21:13   | One automation opens the website and then you auto fill your login credentials or don't            |
| 01:21:19   | auto fill your login credentials, especially if it's one of those banks where you have             |
| 01:21:22   | to get something texted to you or in my case, I have to open an app on my iPhone and get           |
| 01:21:26   | a particular code from that app, which changes it on a regular basis.                              |
| 01:21:30   | It's like 2FA, but it's special to the bank app.                                                   |
| 01:21:34   | And then, you know, and I have to put that in.                                                     |
| 01:21:37   | And then once I've done that, then I would run another automation, which like opens like           |
| 01:21:41   | the right bit on the web page for me and then downloads it or something.                           |
| 01:21:46   | But that is as automated as I would go with this.                                                  |
| 01:21:49   | Yeah, honestly, I think the way I kind of do it now that we're talking about, I have               |
| 01:21:54   | a tab group called banking and in it, I've got the various web pages, which I usually              |
| 01:22:00   | have to re-log into every time I go to the tab group anyway.                                       |
| 01:22:04   | And then there's also automation you could do with [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] or OmniFocus to remind yourself       |
| 01:22:08   | to do it.                                                                                          |
| 01:22:09   | But I actually was relieved to hear, Rose, that you don't do this either because I felt            |
| 01:22:14   | like I was letting people down.                                                                    |
| 01:22:17   | But the more I looked into it, the more I felt like it was something not worth pursuing.           |
| 01:22:23   | The IT person in me is genuinely quite concerned at the security implications of something         |
| 01:22:28   | automatically logging into my bank to download this information.                                   |
| 01:22:31   | So yeah, yeah, like if you're considering doing this, folks, you know, my whole means              |
| 01:22:36   | automatically open up all the web pages you need to download bank statements and credit            |
| 01:22:40   | card statements from.                                                                              |
| 01:22:41   | My whole means create an automation that clicks at the right thing on the web page thanks          |
| 01:22:44   | to [[Keyboard Maestro]] or just opens the URL of that thing after you've logged in.                      |
| 01:22:49   | That's fine.                                                                                       |
| 01:22:50   | But yeah, maybe just leave logging into the human.                                                 |
| 01:22:54   | You know, some things aren't worth automating, especially when it comes to financial security.     |
| 01:22:58   | And the Automators podcast never wants to be responsible for having the black helicopters          |
| 01:23:03   | land on your house.                                                                                |
| 01:23:04   | So yeah, I mean, I would hope it wouldn't go as far as the black helicopters landing               |
| 01:23:09   | on your house, but it certainly could be a case of, you know, like worst case scenario,            |
| 01:23:14   | if you accidentally upload a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro that contains your login information,          |
| 01:23:19   | somebody else could be logging into your bank account and looking at a bunch of stuff you          |
| 01:23:22   | don't want them to look at or taking a look at your money somewhere that you can't have.           |
| 01:23:27   | So yeah, like please be careful with this stuff, people, you know, it's very tempting              |
| 01:23:31   | to go ahead and automate everything and, you know, I know this, you know, I am this.               |
| 01:23:37   | But we know the sickness, we know the sickness, but yeah, nothing to do with your finances,        |
| 01:23:44   | please.                                                                                            |
| 01:23:45   | All right.                                                                                         |

| 01:24:06   | Rose and I are going to be talking about spam blocking foreign languages.                          |
| 01:24:09   | That's a thing.                                                                                    |
