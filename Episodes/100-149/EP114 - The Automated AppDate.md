| 00:00      | Hello, I'm David Sparks and joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard, and this is The                    |
| 00:06      | Automator is where we talk about how to automate your technology to do your work for you.              |
| 00:11      | Hello, Rose.                                                                                           |
| 00:12      | How are you today?                                                                                     |
| 00:13      | I'm pretty good, David.                                                                                |
| 00:14      | How are you?                                                                                           |
| 00:15      | Excellent.                                                                                             |
| 00:16      | We just had the release of Mac OS Ventura, which you and I have been doing beta things                 |
| 00:22      | with for a while.                                                                                      |
| 00:25      | There's an automation angle to this that we wanted to cover because as automators, there's             |
| 00:29      | a bunch of stuff involving shortcuts and other bits and bobs of things they've added.                  |
| 00:34      | We wanted to get into that deep today, so we're going to be doing that.                                |
| 00:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 00:39      | I've been playing with it on and off a bit, and I've been fortunate that I've been playing             |
| 00:42      | a lot with [[Stage Manager]] over the last couple of weeks and months, which of course lets                |
| 00:47      | me get a little bit of a head start because that new feature is on both iPad OS and Mac                |
| 00:52      | OS, which is quite nice.                                                                               |
| 00:55      | It's good to see some more features coming to all the places that we want to use them,                 |
| 01:00      | even if they're not quite there yet necessarily in the form that you and I would both love             |
| 01:04      | to see.                                                                                                |
| 01:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:06      | Well, I definitely want to talk about [[Stage Manager]] not only as a feature, but also in                 |
| 01:10      | terms of automation because there is something to talk about there.                                    |
| 01:15      | But either way, we're going to get to that.                                                            |
| 01:17      | But also today on the bonus section, Automator's Macs, Rose has an automated water bottle,             |
| 01:23      | and I don't know what that means, but we're going to find out together today on Automator's            |
| 01:28      | Macs.                                                                                                  |
| 01:29      | Does it like march over to you and say, drink me?                                                      |
| 01:33      | I don't know what does it do, Rose?                                                                    |
| 01:34      | I can't wait to hear it.                                                                               |
| 01:35      | There's rainbows involved, David.                                                                      |
| 01:36      | There are rainbows.                                                                                    |
| 01:37      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 01:38      | Well, we're going to talk about that.                                                                  |
| 01:39      | But first, before we get into anything, as we do, we occasionally hear from Apple, and                 |
| 01:46      | they've got some new hardware.                                                                         |
| 01:49      | Once we recorded last, Apple has added some new iPads, and we thought it'd be fun to take              |
| 01:55      | a minute to talk about that.                                                                           |
| 01:58      | So we've got the, was it the 10th generation iPad, which is almost an iPad Air, but uses               |
| 02:05      | a really old Apple pencil?                                                                             |
| 02:06      | I mean, I don't know.                                                                                  |
| 02:08      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 02:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 02:10      | It's a very strange iPad.                                                                              |
| 02:11      | I'm so confused.                                                                                       |
| 02:12      | Yeah, I'm so confused because it's, so Logitech have a Logitech crayon, right?                         |
| 02:15      | Which is like the slightly cheaper version, it's targeted very much at schools.                        |
| 02:20      | You like press and hold a button to pair it.                                                           |
| 02:22      | Very simple.                                                                                           |
| 02:23      | Whereas the iPad originally was the one with the, you stick it into the end of your iPad               |
| 02:27      | and it sticks out the side and looks very precarious, but that's how you pair it and                   |
| 02:31      | that's how you can charge it.                                                                          |
| 02:32      | And it came with a little lightning to lightning adapter in the box so you could plug the lightning,   |
| 02:37      | the pencil into one end and a lightning cable into the other and charge it.                            |
| 02:40      | And this was fine when everything was using lightning.                                                 |
| 02:43      | But I guess maybe Mr. Logistics Cook guessed wrong on the number of units they were going              |
| 02:51      | to sell or something because the new iPad is USB-C.                                                    |
| 02:55      | And so they are selling a bonus USB-C to lightning adapter that you can buy to use the Apple           |
| 03:00      | pencil, which is the one that works with the iPad because the new Apple pencil, the one                |
| 03:05      | that magnetises to the side of your iPad, doesn't stick to it and doesn't work with                    |
| 03:09      | it because they move the camera to the top of the iPad.                                                |
| 03:12      | I'm just so confused.                                                                                  |
| 03:14      | There's like 33 different iPads out there now and I have no idea how this works or if                  |
| 03:19      | it works.                                                                                              |
| 03:20      | It's so confusing.                                                                                     |
| 03:21      | I'm really glad my parents don't want new iPads right now.                                             |
| 03:24      | To further confuse things, in the U.S. at least, that little adapter is backordered.                   |
| 03:30      | So like if you get a new 10th generation iPad and you want to use your old pencil with it,             |
| 03:34      | you're not going to be able to charge it or plug it in until weeks.                                    |
| 03:39      | She's a lightning cable for it.                                                                        |
| 03:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 03:44      | That's crazy.                                                                                          |
| 03:45      | I'm just checking here to see if it's backordered as well because I think I have all those Apple       |
| 03:48      | pencils hanging around.                                                                                |
| 03:49      | I don't actually have a use case for it.                                                               |
| 03:51      | I should probably sell it, but yeah, it's a weird time to be buying an Apple pencil.                   |
| 04:01      | I'm just looking and it's not showing up on the website.                                               |
| 04:05      | Excellent work there, Apple.                                                                           |
| 04:06      | Excellent work.                                                                                        |
| 04:07      | USB-C to Apple Pencil adapter.                                                                         |
| 04:11      | There we go.                                                                                           |
| 04:12      | It showed up in the search and apparently right now, if I look to order it, it's arriving              |
| 04:17      | next week just before the Apple TV.                                                                    |
| 04:20      | So it's not too bad over here, but if you desperately need one, David, I'll ship one                   |
| 04:26      | to you.                                                                                                |
| 04:27      | It'll get there faster.                                                                                |
| 04:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 04:29      | Although in fairness, a lot of people buy iPads and never use the pencil.                              |
| 04:33      | So for those that don't care about the Apple pencil, it's actually a pretty good iPad.                 |
| 04:37      | It's shockingly close to the iPad Air and that always happens with the iPads when they                 |
| 04:43      | release new ones.                                                                                      |
| 04:44      | They inch up towards the next tier above them.                                                         |
| 04:48      | It is a little bit of a weird thing and you've got three different tiers.                              |
| 04:52      | I've always viewed as the entry-level tier as people who just don't want to spend a lot.               |
| 04:56      | Like maybe you're sending a kid off to college and you're already spending enough on college.          |
| 05:00      | You want to get them an iPad, but just a basic one or like schools that buy them by the thousands      |
| 05:06      | you want to have an iPad that can serve them, then there's the iPad Air, which to me is                |
| 05:09      | kind of like the default starting point when I'm recommending somebody get an iPad.                    |
| 05:14      | And then the iPad Pro, which is quite a bit more money and has a lot of features that                  |
| 05:19      | some people really care about and some don't care at all.                                              |
| 05:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 05:22      | And then there's the Mini too.                                                                         |
| 05:24      | Don't forget the Mini, David, because the Mini uses the Pro pencil.                                    |
| 05:27      | So it's more like the Air because it's got the pencil and it's got the fingerprint or                  |
| 05:33      | touch ID built into the power button, but it's Mini and I don't understand the difference              |
| 05:39      | anymore.                                                                                               |
| 05:40      | I'm very confused.                                                                                     |
| 05:41      | Like why are the Mini and the iPad Air on the same level, but there's no cheaper iPad                  |
| 05:46      | Mini?                                                                                                  |
| 05:47      | It's, yeah, confusing, but hey, there's new pros.                                                      |
| 05:49      | It doesn't really feel that confusing to me.                                                           |
| 05:51      | I know that's one of the knocks against the iPad line is that it's become confusing, but               |
| 05:56      | I feel like no, the iPads that are there exist for a reason and the Mini is very much in               |
| 06:02      | my mind, a small air than it is a small 10th generation iPad.                                          |
| 06:06      | So I get that.                                                                                         |
| 06:08      | And I don't know.                                                                                      |
| 06:09      | I feel like they kind of, they're doing what they need to do, although the whole thing                 |
| 06:12      | with the pencil, I think is a huge fumble and they should have been a way to figure                    |
| 06:17      | out how to get the second generation Apple pencil to work with it.                                     |
| 06:21      | I just don't get it.                                                                                   |
| 06:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 06:24      | Like I heard basically what it is because what they've done is they've moved the camera                |
| 06:28      | from the left-hand side whilst it's in like the keyboard mode to the top, which is a more              |
| 06:35      | logical place for a camera.                                                                            |
| 06:37      | I'll admit, but because they've put that there, that's where the magnetic part for                     |
| 06:43      | the Apple pencil is on the iPad Pros and on the iPad Air and on the iPad Mini.                         |
| 06:48      | And basically they apparently are unable to put the charger and the camera in the same                 |
| 06:52      | spot.                                                                                                  |
| 06:53      | Now, that does make sense.                                                                             |
| 06:57      | You can like maybe run a ribbon or something inside of the iPad to move the actual charger             |
| 07:01      | bit elsewhere, but then you still got to have the magnet for the iPad there somehow.                   |
| 07:07      | And yeah, it feels like it's quite tricky, especially with the speakers.                               |
| 07:11      | Now maybe if they put the speakers on the top of the iPad instead of on the sides, then                |
| 07:17      | this wouldn't have been a problem because they could have put the Apple pencil at the                  |
| 07:20      | bottom opposite the power button or you would have charged it with the tip always up so                |
| 07:25      | that the pencil tip is next to the power button for touch ID, I don't know.                            |
| 07:30      | But I understand why they've gone with the older Apple pencil, but it just feels like                  |
| 07:35      | maybe they shouldn't have moved the camera if they were going to be that stuck.                        |
| 07:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 07:40      | And honestly, kind of my conclusion on that is if you're going to use the Apple pencil                 |
| 07:44      | a lot, just get an iPad Air, you know, save for another month or two if you need to, because           |
| 07:49      | the generation to Apple pencil is not a incremental improvement over the first one.                    |
| 07:56      | It is a massive improvement.                                                                           |
| 07:58      | And if you're going to do pencil stuff, just like I said, if you have to wait longer than              |
| 08:03      | wait longer, but get yourself into the iPad Air, because this silly thing with this cable              |
| 08:11      | and frankly, the original Apple pencil, it's just, it was a good start, but the generation             |
| 08:16      | to fixes so many problems with it, just, just waiting.                                                 |
| 08:20      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 08:21      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                         |
| 08:22      | Because especially considering the fact that you can then on top of this, you know, get                |
| 08:26      | the pencil from the refurb store, you don't have to buy a new pencil, whichever iPad you're            |
| 08:30      | getting, you know, you can save some money on that.                                                    |
| 08:34      | And of course, if you were getting say an iPad Air or a mini, then you might be able                   |
| 08:37      | to get from the refurb store or if you've been saving your pennies, maybe you can get                  |
| 08:42      | well, the last gym pros because, you know, the M1 iPad pros are amazing.                               |
| 08:47      | But there's M2 ones as well now, David.                                                                |
| 08:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 08:50      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 08:51      | So let's talk about that.                                                                              |
| 08:52      | So you, we've now gone from M1 to M2 in the iPad lines.                                                |
| 08:56      | That was the other big announcement, new pros.                                                         |
| 08:59      | It's very much an incremental improvement over the last year, you know, evolution, hey, we             |
| 09:05      | got new silicon, a couple small changes, but overall it's not a huge change.                           |
| 09:11      | And I'm not sure that we needed a huge change.                                                         |
| 09:13      | Like I for one really like the current iPad design with the squared off edges.                         |
| 09:20      | If Apple suddenly decided to like turn it into the bar of soap that the iPhone was for                 |
| 09:24      | so long, I'd be sad.                                                                                   |
| 09:26      | So I'm glad they're sticking with the same industrial design.                                          |
| 09:29      | And I'm also happy to see that, you know, in Apple's mind, every time we get a new generation          |
| 09:35      | of Apple Silicon, that their products get updated.                                                     |
| 09:38      | I mean, that's, we've already got an M2 MacBook Air, we've got an M2 iPad.                             |
| 09:43      | If the rumors are correct, we're going to have M2 MacBook Pros.                                        |
| 09:46      | In fact, based on recording times, it may exist already by the time this show ships                    |
| 09:52      | because we're recording a little early this, this, this episode.                                       |
| 09:56      | And the rumors are there's going to drop in October and November.                                      |
| 09:59      | So it's, you know, it's good.                                                                          |
| 10:00      | I like that Apple's doing that.                                                                        |
| 10:03      | That doesn't mean if you have the M1 that you're missing out, you need to run out and                  |
| 10:07      | get the M2.                                                                                            |
| 10:08      | Like, this is the iPad, if somebody has an ageing iPad and they want to get the latest                  |
| 10:12      | and greatest, they might as well get the M2.                                                           |
| 10:14      | And I'm, you know, I'm happy to see that.                                                              |
| 10:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 10:18      | Yeah, me too.                                                                                          |
| 10:19      | And, you know, I am actually upgrading my iPad, David.                                                 |
| 10:22      | We'll have to talk about what, what we're doing, but, you know, I wouldn't necessarily                 |
| 10:27      | say that feature-wise, there's necessarily a huge reason to jump from M1 to M2 unless                  |
| 10:33      | you're also doing another change, such as, you know, size, saving, etc.                                |
| 10:37      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 10:38      | In which case, you know, it's worth considering, but, you know, these are, you know, price-wise        |
| 10:43      | pretty much the same as a Mac, so, you know, you got to consider the pros and cons of it.              |
| 10:50      | But it does feel like the iPad Pro line, at the very least, is nice and stable.                        |
| 10:55      | They've not made any changes to the smart keyboard folio or the Magic keyboard in options.             |
| 11:03      | The Apple Pencil is the same.                                                                          |
| 11:05      | It now has a new feature, which I really like the idea of.                                             |
| 11:09      | It's basically got a proximity sensor.                                                                 |
| 11:11      | So as your Apple Pencil gets closer to the screen, it sort of indicates where it is,                   |
| 11:18      | so that, you know, it gives you a kind of visual indication that the Apple Pencil is                   |
| 11:20      | like almost on screen, almost on screen, almost on screen.                                             |
| 11:23      | And now it's touching it, but you've kind of seen things maybe move a little bit depending             |
| 11:27      | on what the app is beneath it first, which is a lovely idea.                                           |
| 11:31      | I really like that.                                                                                    |
| 11:32      | But yeah, there's, you know, obviously, newer, faster processor chip in there, but for most            |
| 11:38      | folks, I suspect they're not really going to notice that in the iPad because we still                  |
| 11:43      | got iPadOS.                                                                                            |
| 11:44      | So, you know, unless you're building huge movies in iMovie or massive songs in Garage                  |
| 11:51      | Band or, you know, another similar app to that, I'm not sure that folks are really going               |
| 11:56      | to need to take full advantage of the processors.                                                      |
| 11:59      | That's it.                                                                                             |
| 12:00      | It's always nice to have those as options.                                                             |
| 12:01      | Yeah, one thing I was disappointed in is that the new iPad Pro 11 did not get the better               |
| 12:08      | screen, you know, we got the better screen last year in the 12.9, I was hoping, well,                  |
| 12:13      | this will be the year that we get in both.                                                             |
| 12:15      | That didn't happen.                                                                                    |
| 12:16      | The 11 still has the screen.                                                                           |
| 12:17      | That being said, honestly, I've seen both screens next to each other.                                  |
| 12:22      | I don't notice that much of a difference and I don't watch enough movies on my iPad to                 |
| 12:26      | justify it.                                                                                            |
| 12:27      | But, you know, that's one thing I thought, well, for an iPad Pro price, they should have               |
| 12:30      | got the better screen in, but maybe it's a supply chain yada yada thing, you know?                     |
| 12:36      | I mean, maybe it is, but also maybe it's just a case of, you know, they felt that they couldn't        |
| 12:40      | get away with it in the form factor that it's currently in, because the 11-inch iPad is,               |
| 12:46      | you know, not the heaviest beast in the world, but by the time you've added a Magic Keyboard           |
| 12:49      | or the Bridge Air Max or something like that, you are, you know, getting to a fairly hefty             |
| 12:53      | beast.                                                                                                 |
| 12:54      | And if changing from Ola to Mini LED was going to add weight to that, even if it theoretically         |
| 13:00      | on paper, you know, numbers to numbers doesn't look like that much of an increase.                     |
| 13:05      | It certainly is something that people will notice when it's in their bag and they're                   |
| 13:07      | carrying it around all day.                                                                            |
| 13:09      | And I know for a lot of folks, myself included, the purpose of the 11-inch iPad is the iPad            |
| 13:14      | that goes with you.                                                                                    |
| 13:16      | And that's why I'm going back to the 11-inch, despite the fact that I won't have Mini LED.             |
| 13:21      | I'm good with that.                                                                                    |
| 13:22      | I'll live with it.                                                                                     |
| 13:23      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 13:24      | So let's talk about that.                                                                              |
| 13:25      | So you bought something.                                                                               |
| 13:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 13:27      | You had the 12.9, was it the M1 or was it a prior?                                                     |
| 13:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 13:32      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 13:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 13:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 13:35      | I had the M1 because previously I'd had an 11-inch, it wasn't the previous gen, it was the one         |
| 13:38      | with the small camera on it, the single camera lens.                                                   |
| 13:42      | And I can tell because I have the smart keyboard folio, which I dug out this weekend, which            |
| 13:45      | obviously won't fit my new device, but it turned out I had a Magic Keyboard as well.                   |
| 13:50      | So I get to save some money on that.                                                                   |
| 13:52      | And yeah, so I've gone 11-inch because what I had until this weekend is I had a 12.9-inch              |
| 14:01      | iPad Pro and I had an iPad Mini.                                                                       |
| 14:04      | The iPad Mini is great because it just fits into all sorts of little bags.                             |
| 14:07      | You can take it with you quite easily.                                                                 |
| 14:09      | But it is quite limited in that you've not got a huge amount of screen space available                 |
| 14:15      | to you.                                                                                                |
| 14:16      | Like it's great for the, I just want to be able to have something bigger in my bag that                |
| 14:20      | I can easily pull out and hold and read, you know, longer articles on.                                 |
| 14:24      | But it's not so great if you want to start typing or doing anything, you know, you lose                |
| 14:28      | half of your screen to a non-screen keyboard unless you have a Bluetooth keyboard, in which            |
| 14:32      | case by the time you get a Bluetooth keyboard, maybe it would have been easier to just have            |
| 14:36      | a slightly larger iPad with you.                                                                       |
| 14:39      | And especially because the iPad Mini is so small, any keyboard that matches it size-wise               |
| 14:43      | is going to have like weird compromised button like key sizes.                                         |
| 14:47      | You know, I tried a couple of different iPad Mini keyboard cases and, wow, like all the                |
| 14:53      | symbol keys were like half sized and things like that.                                                 |
| 14:56      | And I found so many of them, like they just didn't have UK layouts with the L-shaped return            |
| 15:02      | key.                                                                                                   |
| 15:03      | So it would be like a little button, which like would be maybe the size of your standard               |
| 15:06      | letter key for the return on the right side and it'd be like, okay, I am not managing                  |
| 15:12      | type on this.                                                                                          |
| 15:13      | So yeah, so I had to return the iPad Mini keyboards.                                                   |
| 15:17      | So yeah, so basically just keyboards on the iPad Mini were really not working out for me.              |
| 15:22      | Like the ones that actually fitted in as like a case.                                                  |
| 15:24      | So I was always having to carry an extra keyboard with me.                                             |
| 15:26      | And if I'm carrying an iPad and a keyboard, then why don't I just carry an iPad with a                 |
| 15:29      | keyboard?                                                                                              |
| 15:30      | And the answer was, well, the 12.9 inch is great.                                                      |
| 15:33      | I love it.                                                                                             |
| 15:34      | But it's a bit big really to just take with you as the spontaneously, maybe I will actually            |
| 15:40      | end up doing some writing while I'm sitting at my parents place, you know, helping them                |
| 15:43      | go through product boxes, which seems to be a biennial event right now.                                |
| 15:47      | We did that this weekend and so on.                                                                    |
| 15:50      | So instead, you know, I have gone with an 11 inch iPad so that I will be selling the                   |
| 15:57      | 12.9 inch once the 11 inch arrives here in a couple of days.                                           |
| 16:01      | And yeah, and my mom has been eyeing up my iPad Mini for quite a while.                                |
| 16:05      | She keeps sort of looking at it with COVID's eyes.                                                     |
| 16:08      | So I suggested that she does a try before she buys thing and, you know, gives it a solid               |
| 16:13      | shot for say a month or so.                                                                            |
| 16:15      | And if she likes it, then she can buy it for me.                                                       |
| 16:16      | And if not, then I'll sell it or trade it in or similar.                                               |
| 16:20      | So yeah, I'm really looking forward to it, especially as it turned out, I already had                  |
| 16:24      | the Magic Keyboard, which is great because the Magic Keyboard hasn't changed for the                   |
| 16:29      | iPad 11 inch.                                                                                          |
| 16:31      | What I would recommend for the iPad Mini for folks who have one or are interested in one               |
| 16:35      | is don't get a keyboard case, but get one of those folding keyboards.                                  |
| 16:39      | You can get them on Amazon.                                                                            |
| 16:41      | They're about 30 bucks and they're fine.                                                               |
| 16:43      | Like I have one and it's great.                                                                        |
| 16:45      | Oh yeah, they are great.                                                                               |
| 16:46      | Yeah, I have one of those and I really like it.                                                        |
| 16:49      | It's just that by the time I am taking the iPad with me and I'm taking the keyboard,                   |
| 16:54      | you know, and especially with having two iPads, like there's a 50-50 child, so the iPad and            |
| 16:58      | or the keyboard is not going to have battery.                                                          |
| 17:01      | So then I have to take, you know, a charging cable with me and a battery pack and so on.               |
| 17:05      | It just, it felt like everything was becoming a lot of work.                                           |
| 17:08      | Whereas when I had one iPad, this was obviously helped by the fact that I also commuted to             |
| 17:13      | the office on a regular basis.                                                                         |
| 17:14      | So I'd, you know, put my iPad on charge before I went to bed so that then I would have my              |
| 17:18      | iPad ready for use while I was, you know, on the train or the tram or bus or whatever                  |
| 17:23      | it was.                                                                                                |
| 17:24      | But, you know, having one device means it's charged and having just, you know, one keyboard            |
| 17:31      | means it works.                                                                                        |
| 17:32      | And it's just a bit easier.                                                                            |
| 17:33      | I found the folding keyboard, like what the things I like about the Magic Keyboard, you                |
| 17:37      | can just use it in your lap, which is great if I, you know, think of some stuff that I                 |
| 17:40      | want to write down as notes for automators or something, you know, I can just pull out                 |
| 17:43      | the iPad.                                                                                              |
| 17:44      | And, you know, and I've done this, I'm that weirdo who stands like in stores, like balancing           |
| 17:50      | her iPad, like on like an end, like end cap, I think they're called end caps where they've             |
| 17:55      | got like the deals, which are not to say such great deals, where like I will like pull out             |
| 18:00      | a pad and like quickly ties some stuff in because like it's just a faster way of writing               |
| 18:04      | the things down and then shove the iPad back in my bag and continue on my way.                         |
| 18:08      | And yeah, the 11 inch, I think really is the sweet spot for me, you know, I tried going                |
| 18:13      | big on the iPhone, that didn't work out, I tried going big on the iPad, that didn't                    |
| 18:17      | work out.                                                                                              |
| 18:18      | I am still on though on the Apple watch ultra train and that for me is working out.                    |
| 18:24      | I'm loving how big the screen is and how great the battery life is.                                    |
| 18:27      | So yeah, fingers crossed that one continues to work out for me.                                        |
| 18:31      | But I think for the rest of the devices, I will stay happily in the medium side zone.                  |
| 18:37      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 18:38      | Well, that makes sense.                                                                                |
| 18:39      | I mean, I feel like that the iPad 11 is kind of the Goldilocks zone where you get, you                 |
| 18:44      | know, just kind of the right size between small and large.                                             |
| 18:48      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 18:49      | I also am a sucker, I bought an iPad many last year and liked it and used it, but I find               |
| 18:55      | now that I have the bigger iPhone again, that, you know, I don't find that I need it as much           |
| 19:00      | like if I want something small, but big, the iPhone is kind of there.                                  |
| 19:05      | So I think what I'm going to do because Daisy's iPad is ancient.                                       |
| 19:09      | I mean, it's like six, seven years old and the battery dies in it.                                     |
| 19:14      | I think I'm going to just give her my little iPad.                                                     |
| 19:17      | We'll see.                                                                                             |
| 19:18      | I don't know.                                                                                          |
| 19:19      | I haven't decided yet, but I did not buy anything.                                                     |
| 19:22      | I have an M1 11 inch iPad.                                                                             |
| 19:26      | I have an older 12.9.                                                                                  |
| 19:28      | I think it's the first one.                                                                            |
| 19:31      | But something I've done with the iPad, people in the labs know this is I've turned it into             |
| 19:35      | my desktop status board.                                                                               |
| 19:37      | I stick it on a stand underneath my monitor and it's got the calendar and the weather and              |
| 19:44      | the active for OmniFocus list and the currently running timer and just lots of little bits             |
| 19:49      | of data.                                                                                               |
| 19:50      | Like I know right now, for instance, what time it is in London, 7, 25 PM.                              |
| 19:55      | But the, so I've got all that stuff just on the little status board and I had planned                  |
| 20:01      | on selling this iPad.                                                                                  |
| 20:02      | In fact, I had, you know, done the thing online where they were going to send me the box and           |
| 20:06      | I thought, well, let me just try this one thing before I leave.                                        |
| 20:09      | And I'll tell you, I really like this 12.9 inch iPad under my screen.                                  |
| 20:14      | I use it all day and, you know, now that Apple has the ability to share a mouse and keyboard           |
| 20:19      | between the two devices, the 12.9 inch iPad is the iPad I probably use the most, but I                 |
| 20:25      | never move it from its location.                                                                       |
| 20:28      | And the 11 inch goes with me to Disneyland and on trips and things and even around the                 |
| 20:33      | house.                                                                                                 |
| 20:34      | But the, I know I'm really like live in life here, but having a 12.9 just as a secondary               |
| 20:40      | screen at your desk is amazing.                                                                        |
| 20:43      | And if anybody out there has a 12.9 in a drawer that they're not using, get a stand.                   |
| 20:49      | Stick it underneath or next to your Mac and just try this because you will love it.                    |
| 20:54      | It really changes my opinion of this big iPad.                                                         |
| 20:57      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 20:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 20:59      | It's one of those things.                                                                              |
| 21:00      | I really do love, you know, the extra screen space on it and especially being able to use              |
| 21:05      | it with either universal control or, what's the name of the screen extension feature built             |
| 21:12      | into Mac OS?                                                                                           |
| 21:13      | Sidecar.                                                                                               |
| 21:14      | Sidecar.                                                                                               |
| 21:15      | That's the one.                                                                                        |
| 21:16      | Or even, you know, going a little bit further and going, okay, cool, actually, I'm going               |
| 21:20      | to just use this with like a Luna Display or something, which can be a little better                   |
| 21:24      | for certain situations.                                                                                |
| 21:25      | You know, I have my Luna Display dongle.                                                               |
| 21:27      | I've got a little Tom Bihn Ghost Whale in my bag, David's got all sorts of useful little                 |
| 21:32      | things in there.                                                                                       |
| 21:33      | USB A to C adapter, SIM card tool, lune display, things like that.                                     |
| 21:38      | And it's always handy to have that around.                                                             |
| 21:40      | It's got a three in one cable as well, like a little short one for charging devices or                 |
| 21:44      | connecting stuff, but, you know, just being able to use that as the extra screen space.                |
| 21:49      | But I've also found I won't take the 12.9 inch iPad with me if I think I might need                    |
| 21:53      | extra screen space, just because it weighs quite a chunk.                                              |
| 21:58      | And I actually have a 15 inch external display, a portable one.                                        |
| 22:03      | And that weighs less and it's 15 inches, not 12.9 inches.                                              |
| 22:09      | So, you know, it's, it's, it's one of those things where, you know, like maybe the screen              |
| 22:14      | quality is not as great, sure.                                                                         |
| 22:15      | But I'll live with that.                                                                               |
| 22:16      | But yeah, if I just need screen space, then I'll take the spare monitor with me.                       |
| 22:21      | So yeah, but you know, I'm, I'm looking forward to the new 11 inch arriving and also my new            |
| 22:28      | Apple TV, because I bought new Apple TV two weeks earlier.                                             |
| 22:31      | So I was able to return it and get the new one that's coming in, which is good.                        |
| 22:36      | So I'm going to shuffle some Apple TVs around because the new one I bought, I think was                |
| 22:42      | the same gen as the one in my living room.                                                             |
| 22:43      | So I just chucked it in the bedroom, but now I'm getting the new one, like the new, new                |
| 22:47      | one.                                                                                                   |
| 22:48      | I'm going to pop that one in the living room and take the one from the living room, put                |
| 22:50      | it in the bedroom.                                                                                     |
| 22:51      | Yeah, I bought one a month ago because for the, for the indoor studios build and so I'm                |
| 22:57      | beyond the return period and I don't care.                                                             |
| 22:59      | It's the new features aren't that big of a difference.                                                 |
| 23:02      | One other thing you bought though, I know, and I forgot about this product until I saw                 |
| 23:07      | it in the notes is you bought one of those cool little continuity camera stands for                    |
| 23:11      | your phone.                                                                                            |
| 23:12      | Continuity camera for a Mac OS is out with Mac OS Ventura and continuity camera is the                 |
| 23:17      | feature where if you like need to send an attachment in pages, you can like right click                |
| 23:23      | and do an attachment like from the camera on your phone.                                               |
| 23:27      | But they've taken it a step further with Mac OS Ventura and that you can use your phone                |
| 23:31      | camera as your web camera so that you can just like sort of balance your iPhone on a                   |
| 23:38      | nifty little display for your Mac and well, your camera, your phone camera automatically               |
| 23:45      | turns into the webcam and it uses all three lenses on the pro cameras to, you know, do                 |
| 23:50      | fancy like a top down view using like the fisheye lens and everything and then like                    |
| 23:56      | machine learning I guess to tidy it back up so that it's not weirdly stretched and weird               |
| 24:01      | angles.                                                                                                |
| 24:02      | It can do the, what is it, the autofocus things where it'll follow you around and yeah, centre         |
| 24:10      | stage that's the one and I'm just looking forward to it.                                               |
| 24:13      | It like the little Belkin adapters are available in the Apple Store now so I've ordered one            |
| 24:17      | and fingers crossed it's actually supposed to be arriving tomorrow but yeah, it's one                  |
| 24:23      | of those things where I'm thought, you know, that that actually, especially if you've,                 |
| 24:29      | you know, if you're somebody who travels and you need to take your Mac with you and you                |
| 24:33      | need a better camera for it, instead of throwing a web camera in your bag, we've already got           |
| 24:36      | your iPhone.                                                                                           |
| 24:37      | Why not just, you know, throw a little dongle in there and it comes in white and black so              |
| 24:41      | I've ordered it in black to make it easier to lose in the tech bag.                                    |
| 24:45      | I suspect why it would disappear just as easily and yeah, I'm going to be giving it a try.             |
| 24:49      | Yeah, one sad thing I looked it up is they don't make it for the pro display or the pro                |
| 24:54      | display XPR.                                                                                           |
| 24:55      | They, um, no, no, um, no, the studio display, yeah.                                                    |
| 24:58      | No, the studio display's got its own studio, uh, centre stage camera built into it though.             |
| 25:03      | Which is not great, you know, so it's like, why not, you know, have a stand for it.                    |
| 25:07      | Yeah, but, um, but, um, it does have like a little grill on top which I've got fans                    |
| 25:12      | in it so I can understand why they, they wouldn't want people just putting something on there          |
| 25:16      | permanently.                                                                                           |
| 25:17      | Um, you know, it makes sense, um, but also, you know, it would have been nice if they                  |
| 25:21      | had done that.                                                                                         |
| 25:22      | That said, um, you know, um, you can also just pop a web camera on there, especially if it's           |
| 25:27      | something that, you know, isn't moving around.                                                         |
| 25:29      | What I really like about the Belkin adapter is it is, you know, it's like a [[MagSafe]] puck               |
| 25:34      | basically without a cable attached.                                                                    |
| 25:35      | It's a little thicker, but it's, it's not big.                                                         |
| 25:38      | Um, so, you know, that'll be easy enough to pop in my little bag of, uh, tech goodies                  |
| 25:43      | and just take with me all the time.                                                                    |
| 25:44      | Yeah, agreed.                                                                                          |
| 25:45      | Uh, but I do think they should make one for, uh, the bigger screens because this feature               |
| 25:50      | is significantly better.                                                                               |
| 25:52      | There's pro display XDR doesn't even have a camera and then, uh, legendary, you know,                  |
| 25:57      | produce, uh, studio display camera is not very good.                                                   |
| 26:00      | So, you know, why not?                                                                                 |
| 26:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 26:02      | Um, but either way, that's cool.                                                                       |
| 26:03      | Uh, you have to let us know what you think of it once you get it.                                      |
| 26:05      | Yep.                                                                                                   |
| 26:06      | Yeah, I will do.                                                                                       |
| 26:07      | And, uh, yeah, I'm crossing my fingers that the new fun things will actually be new and                |
| 26:11      | fun, but, uh, it's always good to see that, uh, Apple are, you know, bringing out updates              |
| 26:16      | and especially, um, you know, the, the updates, the Apple TV don't sound like much, but they           |
| 26:20      | have explicitly added a, the ability for it to be a threat border router, which for those              |
| 26:24      | of you into smart home things, if you've been looking at a new Apple TV for a while now,               |
| 26:29      | you know, this is the one to get it.                                                                   |
| 26:31      | Well, it's, I mean, you get the, the slightly more expensive one, which is the same price              |
| 26:35      | as it was previously anyway.                                                                           |
| 26:37      | Um, because, you know, it's then got, um, you know, the ability to do all of that and                  |
| 26:42      | the, uh, super fast internet connection via ethernet, which is great.                                  |
| 26:45      | So, uh, yeah, it's, uh, good to see that they're doing updates.                                        |
| 26:48      | So everybody can, uh, jump on the automation bandwagon.                                                |

| 28:46      | Go check it out.                                                                                       |
| 28:47      | Okay, so we've had fun talking about new products.                                                     |
| 28:51      | Let's talk about automations that have been affected by the release of Mac OS Ventura.                 |
| 28:59      | Starting with spotlight quick actions.                                                                 |
| 29:01      | This was a little announcement at the keynote, but it is something I think automators should           |
| 29:05      | be aware of.                                                                                           |
| 29:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 29:07      | Yeah, so spotlight quick actions coming to the Macs doesn't really sound like anything                 |
| 29:12      | particularly amazing, especially because guess what?                                                   |
| 29:15      | They're in the touch bar too.                                                                          |
| 29:16      | Yeah, the touch bar that practically nobody will have on a Mac unless they're buying something         |
| 29:22      | from the refurb store.                                                                                 |
| 29:23      | They already had one with a touch bar.                                                                 |
| 29:26      | Didn't seem to be around for super long, but spotlight quick actions essentially is                    |
| 29:30      | Apple making the most of the fact that they're bringing the stocks app, the weather app,               |
| 29:34      | the clock app, and things like that over to Mac OS Ventura, because now with spotlight,                |
| 29:40      | you can run a quick action.                                                                            |
| 29:41      | So if you type command space and enter spotlight, then you can start a timer, nine minutes,            |
| 29:48      | or just nine minute timer seem to work for me as well.                                                 |
| 29:51      | Or if you type weather, it'll show you the weather.                                                    |
| 29:54      | And if you type stocks, AAPL, it shows you the Apple stock price.                                      |
| 30:01      | But I think that this is really actually a good thing because we've had shortcuts in                   |
| 30:05      | spotlight on the iPhone for a while now.                                                               |
| 30:09      | And it was one of those things where if it's not in spotlight, all of the other apps that              |
| 30:15      | sort of piggyback onto the spotlight index will also not be able to see it.                            |
| 30:19      | So they then have to do their own custom integration to do things like get shortcuts                   |
| 30:24      | and stuff like that.                                                                                   |
| 30:26      | And they're constantly having to reinvent the wheel.                                                   |
| 30:28      | And I think it's nice to have a more powerful spotlight for everybody because, I mean, I               |
| 30:35      | don't know about you, David, but one of the ways that I use my computer is primarily the               |
| 30:40      | keyboard.                                                                                              |
| 30:41      | So being able to type command space, even if I'm in spotlight and find the things that                 |
| 30:45      | I'm looking for is pretty great.                                                                       |
| 30:47      | Yeah, I agree.                                                                                         |
| 30:48      | And I feel like this is just something that needed to happen for a lot of reasons.                     |
| 30:52      | I mean, we're going to talk later about shortcuts and just how there were so many problems and         |
| 30:57      | shortcuts for trying to call basic data from apps like the clock app that just didn't exist            |
| 31:04      | on the Mac.                                                                                            |
| 31:05      | And you needed, in order for shortcuts to really land on the Mac, you needed to have                   |
| 31:09      | the parity.                                                                                            |
| 31:10      | But the nice thing is they didn't just stop there.                                                     |
| 31:12      | They're like, OK, well, now that we've got this here, where else can we do it?                         |
| 31:16      | And the spotlight thing, I think, is great for people who aren't even interested in shortcuts.         |
| 31:20      | I think this is an automation that's worth checking out.                                               |
| 31:24      | So walk us through.                                                                                    |
| 31:25      | Rose, how do you check the weather using [[Spotlight]]?                                                    |
| 31:28      | Well, so I have [[Spotlight]] under, I've actually got it under option P on my Mac OS Ventura              |
| 31:37      | Mac, which is off here to my left.                                                                     |
| 31:39      | And then I just typed weather.                                                                         |
| 31:41      | And of course, now I've dismissed it because the machine's off to my left.                             |
| 31:44      | And so I was looking at the wrong screen and managed to activate, well, my Hawk Corners                |
| 31:49      | on my Mac Studio, you know, universal control works really well when you hit the right corners,        |
| 31:55      | a little bit of a requirement there.                                                                   |
| 31:56      | But yeah, I have to say, you just type and it goes, and that's kind of it.                             |
| 32:05      | There's nothing crazy to it, which is honestly a very positive surprise.                               |
| 32:13      | Every so often when you're trying to do something and tell somebody how something works, and           |
| 32:18      | it's like, oh, wait, actually, no, this is really complicated.                                         |
| 32:21      | How do I explain this in three easy steps?                                                             |
| 32:24      | Well, the good news is you don't need to worry about that with this.                                   |
| 32:27      | It is just weather, at least for me that worked.                                                       |
| 32:31      | Did that work for you as well, David?                                                                  |
| 32:33      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                            |
| 32:34      | And hopefully it's more discoverable by people as well in that sense.                                  |
| 32:38      | [[Spotlight]] for me, I always have to think about it too, because I use [[Alfred]] as my command              |
| 32:42      | space, you know, so I've got to go over to option space to get that going.                             |
| 32:47      | I haven't used it a lot through the beta because frankly, I've got other ways to do this stuff.        |
| 32:52      | But I do think, you know, this is kind of like a boon from bringing those apps over.                   |
| 32:58      | Yeah, I've just discovered, okay, so the first time I did it when I was testing it, I typed            |
| 33:02      | weather, it worked.                                                                                    |
| 33:03      | Now I've typed weather a couple of times, didn't work.                                                 |
| 33:06      | But I found if you do type current weather, okay, or I'm just going to try weather now,                |
| 33:11      | yeah, if I type weather now, then it shows me the weather where I am geographically located.           |
| 33:17      | And if I type in a city nearby, then it'll even show me that for that city, which is                   |
| 33:22      | pretty great.                                                                                          |
| 33:23      | And then for some reason, it's not showing me the option to open this in the weather                   |
| 33:27      | app.                                                                                                   |
| 33:28      | That would have been a bit more logical, but it is giving me a good old [[Safari]] where you               |
| 33:33      | can check whether now Bristol or Bristol TN weather, I'm guessing there's a Bristol in                 |
| 33:38      | Tennessee.                                                                                             |
| 33:39      | I'll have to find out after the show.                                                                  |
| 33:41      | Yeah, we've got in the US, we've got every British town copied, you know, it's just the                |
| 33:46      | way, because, you know, founding, everybody came over from those places and they're like,              |
| 33:51      | new Bristol, right, you know, New York, right, it's all, it's all a copy.                              |
| 33:56      | Yes, yeah.                                                                                             |
| 33:57      | You can also trigger shortcuts and spotlight, which I think is kind of fun, you know, if               |
| 34:01      | you've got a lot of shortcuts built and you just want to trigger a shortcut, it's another              |
| 34:05      | great way to fire off a shortcut.                                                                      |
| 34:07      | Yes, yeah, though, I have to say, it does appear that what happens.                                    |
| 34:12      | So I've just typed automators because I've got lots of automated shortcuts, obviously                  |
| 34:18      | I've got various different things that are related to it, and it is only showing me one                |
| 34:23      | shortcut.                                                                                              |
| 34:24      | Well, it's showing me two recommendations at the top, one of which isn't a shortcut,                   |
| 34:27      | it's something else that I've got saved on my Mac that's identifying as an application.                |
| 34:32      | And then it's showing me, you know, four related internet searches, plus a search icon with            |
| 34:43      | the word automators after it.                                                                          |
| 34:44      | And then after that, it shows me shortcuts, which gives me one shortcut, I've got way                  |
| 34:49      | more than that.                                                                                        |
| 34:50      | And then it's going into documents.                                                                    |
| 34:52      | So I'm going to have to go back in and fiddle with the settings or the system, well, it                |
| 34:56      | is system settings now, isn't it, because they've changed the name of system preferences.              |
| 35:00      | But yeah, so for anybody who had [[Spotlight]] disabled, because they've been using [[Alfred]]                 |
| 35:05      | or something, and they want to go ahead and re-enable it, you'll need to look for the                  |
| 35:10      | keyboard options in the new settings, system settings app.                                             |
| 35:15      | And then you can actually re-enable it under keyboard shortcuts, which is quite good, and              |
| 35:20      | that's how you can change it as well.                                                                  |
| 35:23      | But once you've done that, it's well worth taking a moment to check out, obviously you've              |
| 35:30      | got your app shortcuts with your modified keys and everything there, including screenshots.            |
| 35:36      | But you should also, aside from that, not in the keyboard settings, actually check out                 |
| 35:42      | the sharing and under privacy and security, I believe it was when I was looking for this               |
| 35:49      | earlier.                                                                                               |
| 35:50      | And of course, it's here, yeah, privacy and security extensions, because there are a number            |
| 35:57      | of extensions in macOS, and you've probably encountered some of these before.                          |
| 36:03      | But the way that the share sheet on macOS works has updated, and why I say it's updated,               |
| 36:09      | I mean, it's much more like a share sheet, share sheet now, rather than the share button               |
| 36:15      | that kind of works the same way as it does on iOS, but doesn't work the same way as it                 |
| 36:18      | does on iOS.                                                                                           |
| 36:21      | And to pair with this, they seem to have consolidated quite a few things down into one single system,  |
| 36:27      | some settings, paying.                                                                                 |
| 36:28      | So you've got all of your actions and your touch bar controls there, you've got your                   |
| 36:34      | finder options for quick actions and preview, and all of your shortcuts show up, all of                |
| 36:40      | your shortcuts that you have enabled to show up in the right click menu show up here, which            |
| 36:44      | means that if you've created something previously, such as share PDF to David, so that you can         |
| 36:51      | send anything that you want as a PDF to David Sparks, don't fill in the inbox with spam                |
| 36:57      | folks.                                                                                                 |
| 36:58      | But, you know, that's something that you can then enable in the various different places,              |
| 37:03      | and that will sync back into the Shortcuts app.                                                        |
| 37:06      | But it's quite nice that it's all in the system settings now, which is a nice improvement              |
| 37:11      | for all of that.                                                                                       |
| 37:13      | So yeah, that's, I have to say, under quick look, David, I'm getting a few strange things.             |
| 37:20      | So I've got thumbnails, which looks like pixel meter and Ulysses, but then I've got desktop            |
| 37:25      | quick look preview, which is all one word, Pascal cased, but it looks like that the way                |
| 37:33      | that they've named some of these things, or they've suggested that developers name things              |
| 37:38      | has not been entirely clear to folks, because that's not showing up the name of the app                |
| 37:42      | at all.                                                                                                |
| 37:44      | But it does mean that you can easily go through and enable or disable quick look actions and           |
| 37:49      | sharing for various apps, which will allow you to get data into them in some faster and                |
| 37:56      | easier ways.                                                                                           |
| 37:57      | Yeah, and you know, it's interesting because they're definitely like treading into more                |
| 38:03      | power features into this, like, for instance, if you do a contact search in the spotlight,             |
| 38:11      | you get a lot of cool stuff.                                                                           |
| 38:12      | You get like recent messages and shared documents, and like even like a list of events and reminders   |
| 38:18      | when I like absurd rows, I can actually see your next birthday showing up here in my calendar          |
| 38:24      | list and some other stuff.                                                                             |
| 38:26      | So that's kind of nice, right?                                                                         |
| 38:29      | And that's stuff that you don't traditionally get with something like [[Alfred]].                          |
| 38:33      | But then at the same time, it just doesn't have nearly the power of something like [[Alfred]]              |
| 38:36      | does.                                                                                                  |
| 38:37      | So it's like, you got to figure it out.                                                                |
| 38:38      | I, what I've chosen to do is just keep it as a separate, you know, keyboard shortcut.                  |
| 38:44      | And there are certain things I use it for, but I still kind of be honest with you, I                   |
| 38:49      | still prefer [[Alfred]].                                                                                   |
| 38:50      | I mean, as an automator, there's just so much more I can do with it.                                   |
| 38:54      | Yes, exactly.                                                                                          |
| 38:56      | And you know, it's just nice to have those, you know, same features regardless, even if                |
| 39:03      | you've got one Mac that maybe is running an older version of Mac OS for a while, you know,             |
| 39:08      | having the ability to have one app that does the same things across those platforms can                |
| 39:12      | be very useful.                                                                                        |
| 39:14      | So yeah, they're speaking of things that don't necessarily sink across the different versions          |
| 39:18      | of Mac OS, but are in the new Mac OS are the new focus modes, David, because focus modes               |
| 39:25      | work in Mac OS Monterey, but the massive upgrade that they've had is now there in Mac OS Ventura,      |
| 39:32      | because for the last couple of weeks, every time I've opened system preferences on my                  |
| 39:38      | Mac and I've clicked into trying to figure out why I'm not getting a notification from                 |
| 39:44      | a certain app, it's always been in the case of like, oh, you've changed how this how the               |
| 39:49      | notifications for this for this focus mode work on iOS, and we don't know how to deal                  |
| 39:55      | with it.                                                                                               |
| 39:56      | Yeah, that's one good reason to upgrade is just to get everything on the same grounds,                 |
| 39:59      | right?                                                                                                 |
| 40:00      | Exactly.                                                                                               |
| 40:01      | So yeah, I will be updating my Mac to Mac OS Ventura ASAP now that the released version                |
| 40:07      | is out.                                                                                                |
| 40:08      | Obviously, I've just had one that's been running the beta for testing purposes, especially             |
| 40:13      | considering the fact that I record podcasts, I didn't want to risk breaking my main machine.           |
| 40:18      | But yeah, it's good that you now have the option to to flip it around and do the allowed               |
| 40:23      | options instead of the denied.                                                                         |
| 40:26      | And of course, you know, it then syncs.                                                                |
| 40:29      | And I've noticed as well, David, at least on this Mac, and I'll have to see if that                    |
| 40:33      | holds true across others, it feels like those those apps that you've listed there do a better          |
| 40:39      | job of handling.                                                                                       |
| 40:40      | ASAP is for a different platform and would have been installed from somewhere else.                    |
| 40:45      | Because something that I'd previously noticed when I enabled notifications from, I don't               |
| 40:51      | know, say [[BBEdit]], there was a 5050 chance that it would show up as just like the sort                 |
| 40:55      | of gray app square with like the lines around it on iOS with unknown application underneath            |
| 41:04      | it, versus, you know, maybe it might say like that it's [[BBEdit]], but it wouldn't have the              |
| 41:09      | icon or actually sometimes it would have the icon and not have a name or yeah, I don't know,           |
| 41:14      | it was it was confusing.                                                                               |
| 41:15      | It seems to be doing better now.                                                                       |
| 41:17      | I'm not confident that that's necessarily going to stick 100%, but it does certainly                   |
| 41:22      | feel like it's more stable when it comes to sharing that because the number of times I've              |
| 41:27      | removed notifications from one app, because I don't know what that is, I must not have                 |
| 41:31      | it installed anymore, maybe focus focus modes have, you know, failed to realise that I've              |
| 41:35      | uninstalled this app from my device and then realised that I actually know this was a Mac              |
| 41:40      | app or it was installed on another Mac has been quite a few, actually, as I was tweaking               |
| 41:45      | everything.                                                                                            |

| 43:14      | That's TextExpander.com/automators to say goodbye to Repetitive Typing.                          |
| 43:19      | I'll thanks to Tech Six Panda for their support of this show.                                          |
| 43:22      | Okay, so let's talk about shortcuts.                                                                   |
| 43:26      | We've been dancing around a little bit.                                                                |
| 43:27      | The first thing that really is relevant for people on macOS Ventura is those new apps,                 |
| 43:32      | Clock, Weather, Stocks.                                                                                |
| 43:34      | It allows you to do a lot more with shortcuts that on the Mac that you couldn't do before.             |
| 43:40      | For example, the clock to me is probably the most important one because I do a lot of shortcuts        |
| 43:45      | that are focus-related or work mode-related, and I want to start a shortcut, set up writing            |
| 43:53      | mode, and then set a timer for 45 minutes, and then that timer will go off.                            |
| 43:57      | 45 minutes is to make sure that I'm actually still writing in 45 minutes.                              |
| 44:01      | It's kind of a way to keep myself honest.                                                              |
| 44:04      | For the longest time, I could only run those shortcuts on an iPhone or an iPad that was                |
| 44:08      | next to my Mac, and having the ability to get those running on my Mac to me is a huge                  |
| 44:14      | benefit.                                                                                               |
| 44:15      | Yes, same.                                                                                             |
| 44:17      | One of the things that I do is the shortcut that starts my day on or my working day on                 |
| 44:23      | my iPhone actually goes through and it checks if I'm in the office or not, and if I'm not              |
| 44:27      | in the office, then it sets a little alarm for three minutes before each meeting, because              |
| 44:35      | I found the calendar or outlook that we use for work has options of one minute and five                |
| 44:45      | minute reminders.                                                                                      |
| 44:46      | Five minutes is too long.                                                                              |
| 44:47      | I'll be sitting there for two minutes staring at my screen or getting distracted.                      |
| 44:52      | One minute is not long enough if you need to run to the bathroom, grab a glass of water, or similar.             |
| 44:56      | Three minutes seems to be the sweet spot.                                                              |
| 44:58      | So easy enough, when the day starts, go ahead, set some alarms.                                        |
| 45:04      | But I had to do that on my phone, and what I found is then I'm sitting there using my                  |
| 45:09      | computer and my phone alarm rings while I'm on a call with somebody else, maybe we hopped              |
| 45:15      | into the meeting early or something to chat about something and get something out of the               |
| 45:19      | way with, or maybe I'm talking to them instead of the meeting that we had planned, and my              |
| 45:24      | phone alarm is going off.                                                                              |
| 45:27      | Whereas now it comes through my headphones, so they don't have to hear that.                           |
| 45:30      | I can hear that, and I can hit snooze or whatever.                                                     |
| 45:33      | So it's just good to have these things there, because it does just mean that you've got                |
| 45:39      | the same options on every device to an extent.                                                         |
| 45:43      | So you don't have to do as much, hey, if this is a Mac, I guess I'll just skip it for now.             |
| 45:50      | And it really depends on the context, like for example, if I have something related to                 |
| 45:54      | the garden, like a lot of times I'll have some plants I want to only put in the sun for like           |
| 45:58      | three hours a day, and I'll set an alarm for that.                                                     |
| 46:01      | Well, I want that on my phone or my watch, because I don't know that I'll be necessarily               |
| 46:04      | at my computer in three hours, but so that'll work.                                                    |
| 46:08      | But all the work related stuff, I really find best on the Mac and just keep it in one place.           |
| 46:14      | And just to go through those new shortcuts actions that we're getting related to clock,                |
| 46:19      | there are several, but the few of them that I'm already finding I use all the time is                  |
| 46:24      | create alarm.                                                                                          |
| 46:25      | So like, you can create an alarm in shortcuts now, it's something you can only do on mobile            |
| 46:30      | devices before you can toggle the alarms off and on, and you can start a timer, you know,              |
| 46:35      | countdown timer.                                                                                       |
| 46:36      | And just those three are all I really need, but you can also get all alarms, you can open              |
| 46:40      | tabs, you can do more with it.                                                                         |
| 46:44      | But I find that while the clock app is nice to have on the Mac, the shortcuts actions                  |
| 46:49      | are great to have.                                                                                     |
| 46:50      | And I really believe the only reason they put the clock app on here was to enable that                 |
| 46:55      | stuff with spotlight and shortcuts.                                                                    |
| 46:58      | I think the app is secondary really in Apple's eyes.                                                   |
| 47:02      | Well, I don't know if the app is secondary because this is something that I've discovered              |
| 47:06      | periodically with my parents, you know, we'll go through this song and dance every couple              |
| 47:10      | of months of, hey, this app's not on my Mac.                                                           |
| 47:13      | Well, that's because the app doesn't exist for Mac.                                                    |
| 47:16      | The most recent one actually was BBC Sounds, which just isn't there on the Mac, they want              |
| 47:20      | you to use the website.                                                                                |
| 47:21      | And my dad had downloaded some weird janky app with loads of ads from the App Store of                 |
| 47:26      | all places.                                                                                            |
| 47:27      | It was terrible, like App Store candidates.                                                            |
| 47:29      | So instead I installed the Sonos app and just set it as a favourite in Sonos and that solved            |
| 47:34      | the problem for him.                                                                                   |
| 47:35      | But, you know, it periodically comes up with them, you know, and I know we've gone through             |
| 47:38      | this before, you know, of, hey, this app's not on my Mac, where'd it go?                               |
| 47:43      | Never was on your Mac.                                                                                 |
| 47:44      | The weather app didn't exist, clock app didn't exist, socks wasn't there.                              |
| 47:49      | And yeah, it's kind of, you know, one of those things where, yeah, okay, there's websites              |
| 47:55      | for all of this stuff, but people who especially those upgrading from an iPad are familiar with        |
| 48:02      | there's an app for that.                                                                               |
| 48:04      | And especially Apple's apps, you know, they now that they've got a catalyst and, you know,             |
| 48:10      | they're similar methods of making things cross-platform, making their own apps actually go across      |
| 48:14      | the platform seems like a really good move.                                                            |
| 48:17      | So I'm glad that they've done that because it will hopefully finally end the quest of                  |
| 48:21      | Rose, where'd the weather app go every three months?                                                   |
| 48:24      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                            |
| 48:26      | So that's cool.                                                                                        |
| 48:27      | I like that.                                                                                           |
| 48:28      | And that does improve shortcuts.                                                                       |
| 48:29      | It makes things better.                                                                                |
| 48:31      | I also like, you know, we talked about this is a little bit overlap with the iOS 16 show,              |
| 48:36      | but the programming modes to create these actions now are much simpler.                                |
| 48:41      | So I think that's something that's going to be the gift that keeps giving for us.                      |
| 48:45      | We're going to get a lot more shortcuts actions.                                                       |
| 48:47      | And in particular, I think this really matters on the Mac because there's a lot of historical          |
| 48:52      | Mac developers that make great apps that have not really embraced automation.                          |
| 48:57      | And I feel like in this next year, we may see some of those apps actually step in and                  |
| 49:02      | use it because the barrier to entry is so much lower now.                                              |
| 49:05      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 49:06      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                         |
| 49:07      | And, you know, it's just one of those things where having everything everywhere definitely             |
| 49:13      | makes it easier and knowing that it's Apple stuff that's available everywhere too really               |
| 49:19      | helps.                                                                                                 |
| 49:20      | You know, I've just double-checking.                                                                   |
| 49:22      | The Mac OS Ventura, like the Apple newsroom actual article about Mac OS Ventura coming                 |
| 49:28      | out, which I'll make a point of putting in the show notes, only talks about weathering                 |
| 49:31      | clocks.                                                                                                |
| 49:32      | That's not even mentioned here, which is kind of funny for me.                                         |
| 49:36      | But yeah, it's just good to see that everything finally is everywhere.                                 |
| 49:40      | And maybe we'll get everything everywhere for everything from now on.                                  |
| 49:45      | I'll cross my fingers.                                                                                 |
| 49:47      | We can only hope.                                                                                      |
| 49:48      | We can only hope on that.                                                                              |
| 49:50      | Let's talk about the share sheet.                                                                      |
| 49:52      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 49:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 49:54      | So the share sheet wasn't a share sheet, but it kind of was a share sheet.                             |
| 49:58      | And everyone was expecting because on iOS, when you want to send something to a shortcut,              |
| 50:04      | you put it in the share sheet.                                                                         |
| 50:05      | And on Mac OS, you didn't put it as a share sheet app.                                                 |
| 50:11      | You could still check the box for it being a share sheet app, but you had to take some                 |
| 50:16      | other boxes as well, which were basically users quick action, and then you could turn                  |
| 50:21      | it on for the finder or the services menu.                                                             |
| 50:24      | And that was okay, but the problem is, is how do you find the services menu?                           |
| 50:32      | Good question.                                                                                         |
| 50:33      | The answer, it depends.                                                                                |
| 50:35      | So if I right-click in [[Safari]], just on a page, no services menu.                                       |
| 50:40      | If I select some text in [[Safari]] and then right-click, I get a services menu, but that only gets        |
| 50:46      | the text that I've selected.                                                                           |
| 50:47      | It only gets the web page.                                                                             |
| 50:49      | But then, and this is on Mac OS Monterey, if I click the little share icon in [[Safari]],                  |
| 50:53      | then I can see, ooh, [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]], Mac OS simulator, okay, messages, fine.                                |
| 51:00      | You know, create a new quick note, add a bookmark, open in news, fairer.                               |
| 51:05      | And then I tap on a little dot, dot, dot, thinking, okay, where's shortcuts?                           |
| 51:07      | Where's shortcuts?                                                                                     |
| 51:08      | I'll find shortcuts here.                                                                              |
| 51:09      | And I scroll, I do some more scrolling, and there's no shortcuts, but they fix that with               |
| 51:15      | Mac OS Ventura because shortcuts is there in the share sheet for Mac OS Ventura.                       |
| 51:20      | And they seem to have just upgraded it a bit.                                                          |
| 51:22      | It feels like it works better in many ways.                                                            |
| 51:26      | And it seems like, I don't know, maybe it's easier for app developers to integrate with                |
| 51:30      | it.                                                                                                    |
| 51:31      | I've not actually tried doing that myself, so I'm doing some guesswork.                                |
| 51:34      | But it feels like I'm seeing more apps there than I used to.                                           |
| 51:38      | I would just say that overall, I feel like indexing and activating shortcuts feels like                |
| 51:42      | it's been juiced up as we get into Mac OS Ventura.                                                     |
| 51:45      | And that's, you know, it wasn't great before, you know.                                                |
| 51:49      | And last year was the first year of shortcuts on the Mac, and I felt like that was something           |
| 51:53      | for whatever reason was not optimised.                                                                 |
| 51:55      | And it does feel a lot better now.                                                                     |
| 51:58      | Yes, exactly.                                                                                          |
| 51:59      | So what we can do is we can put a link to, there's a [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/) article about this,                   |
| 52:05      | which they wrote actually back in July.                                                                |
| 52:08      | So the share sheet has gone through a few little updates since then, but it's still,                   |
| 52:13      | you know, working the same way that they described, which is really good.                              |
| 52:18      | And you know, so yeah, it's nice to have your shortcuts there, especially because my favourite          |
| 52:25      | thing is if you enable something as a service and as a quick action, and then you right-click          |
| 52:29      | and find it on it, then if you look under the quick actions, then you would get, like,                 |
| 52:34      | big shortcuts icons.                                                                                   |
| 52:35      | And then if you go down in services, you get the same shortcuts without icons.                         |
| 52:40      | So yeah, it feels easier to understand that things are in the share sheet now.                         |
| 52:47      | And it feels like they work the same way as well, whereas previously, share sheet, photos,             |
| 52:53      | for example, if you were sharing photos to a shortcut on iOS, that was fine, but are                   |
| 52:58      | your photos in the Photos app on macOS, or are they maybe in the Files app in Finder,                  |
| 53:05      | so that you actually wanted to have Finder show up instead.                                            |
| 53:10      | So yeah, I'm glad that they seem to have slimmed this down a little bit just to make                   |
| 53:16      | it easier for us.                                                                                      |
| 53:17      | So whereas I was curious, now we're hitting the second year with [[Shortcuts]] on the Mac,                 |
| 53:21      | and it's getting better and faster and more powerful.                                                  |
| 53:24      | Where do you draw the line between [[Keyboard Maestro]] and [[Shortcuts]] at this point in time?               |
| 53:32      | I mean, it really depends.                                                                             |
| 53:33      | Like, I still find myself struggling a little bit to remember to run [[Shortcuts]] on the Mac.             |
| 53:38      | You know, I do, and I've got them built into a number of other places.                                 |
| 53:44      | But I find that for me on the Mac, it's the sort of thing where [[Keyboard Maestro]] will                  |
| 53:49      | fire off a, you know, a run this shortcut action, or Bunch will fire off a run this shortcut           |
| 53:54      | action versus, you know, it being a shortcut to do whatever the thing is that I want to                |
| 54:02      | do.                                                                                                    |
| 54:03      | You know, there are some exceptions.                                                                   |
| 54:04      | I've got some stream type buttons, which will allow me to select certain focus modes                   |
| 54:08      | or various other things which are running shortcuts to do this.                                        |
| 54:13      | But it is predominantly still [[Keyboard Maestro]], [[Bunch]], you know, [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]] still in there.         |
| 54:21      | You know, all of the automation tools are there.                                                       |
| 54:24      | And you know, shortcuts isn't bad or wrong.                                                            |
| 54:27      | It's just not quite there yet.                                                                         |
| 54:30      | You know, it feels like I'm still missing some of the features that I need to do a lot                 |
| 54:37      | of the stuff that I want to do on the Mac.                                                             |
| 54:39      | Like you can tell it's come from iOS and it's getting better.                                          |
| 54:42      | It's getting a lot better.                                                                             |
| 54:43      | But, you know, and I think some of this is the fact that, you know, just there isn't                   |
| 54:49      | an easy way for them to integrate with something like [[Stage Manager]] or [[Spaces]].                         |
| 54:54      | You know, like [[Spaces]] famously doesn't actually have an API.                                           |
| 54:58      | And I don't mean like a REST API, like a web-based one.                                                |
| 55:01      | I mean, like, it's just not accessible to programmers.                                                 |
| 55:04      | So you can't have an application say, hey, I'm going to go and open up in a new space.                 |
| 55:12      | Like if you full-screen something and then you open a new window, automatic opens in                   |
| 55:15      | a new space.                                                                                           |
| 55:17      | But if you have two windows of an application and they're in different spaces, they kind               |
| 55:21      | of don't really know about that or how to handle it or anything.                                       |
| 55:26      | And you know, so if you're right-clicking in your dock, you can put something in a particular          |
| 55:29      | space or on a specific desktop or in all the spaces, but that's kind of as good as it gets.            |
| 55:34      | So it's not surprising that [[Shortcuts]] doesn't have support for things like that, that other            |
| 55:38      | automation apps have kind of found ways to work around.                                                |
| 55:42      | But it feels like, you know, especially with things like [[Safari]] tab groups and so on, not              |
| 55:47      | yet having actions, despite the fact that they're on iOS, like they're still a way to                  |
| 55:51      | go.                                                                                                    |
| 55:52      | And I don't know how much of that [[Shortcuts]] versus other teams at Apple, or if it's a                  |
| 55:56      | case of like they need to find the time to work together.                                              |
| 55:59      | Yeah, I feel like there are lines for me, too.                                                         |
| 56:02      | Like [[Shortcuts]] for me is, there are some things [[Shortcuts]] are better than [[Keyboard Maestro]].            |
| 56:07      | You know, I've talked about this before, like I think contact management is easier with                |
| 56:11      | [[Shortcuts]] than with [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                  |
| 56:13      | And some of the other kind of native data stuff that just for whatever reason aren't                   |
| 56:18      | that accessible through [[Keyboard Maestro]] without resorting to [[AppleScript]].                            |
| 56:23      | I also feel like [[Shortcuts]] is really good at like multiple app simple shortcuts.                       |
| 56:29      | Like project creation is a good example for me.                                                        |
| 56:32      | Like when I create a new project, I usually create an [[OmniFocus]] task list.                             |
| 56:37      | If it's a labs thing or that I use [[Craft]], we have a shared platform for [[Craft]].                         |
| 56:43      | So I create a [[Craft]] document and I add a calendar event.                                               |
| 56:46      | Things like that, I feel like [[Shortcuts]] is actually better than [[Keyboard Maestro]] for                   |
| 56:51      | and it's multi-platform.                                                                               |
| 56:52      | So all the time I put into creating it means I can run it on any device and the project                |
| 56:57      | creation happens.                                                                                      |
| 57:00      | Where [[Keyboard Maestro]] for me is number one, single app customisations, you know, we're                |
| 57:06      | talking about Kraft, there are some things Kraft doesn't do that I'd like and I basically              |
| 57:11      | added the features with [[Keyboard Maestro]] trickery and like I've got a Kraft directory                  |
| 57:17      | that only these Shortcuts or [[Keyboard Maestro]] scripts only run if Kraft is the active document.        |
| 57:23      | There's no mechanism for that in Shortcuts and it would be super slow if it did.                       |
| 57:30      | And then like the contextual computing stuff where like I have a bunch of like crazy Keyboard          |
| 57:37      | Maestro scripts that I've written just on an as needed basis.                                          |
| 57:41      | And if I just hold down control option command M, which stands for MacSparky, it gives me             |
| 57:45      | a list of like, you know, I don't know, 50, 60 of these things.                                        |
| 57:49      | And then they, they whittle down with a conflict palette, like for the focus or for the automators     |
| 57:55      | podcast, if I just type A, then it gets rid of like, it goes from 60 to like seven, you                |
| 58:00      | know, and then if I type A and then G, then it opens the Google documents folder.                      |
| 58:05      | And so stuff like that, it's just not, I just feel like Shortcuts doesn't really lend itself           |
| 58:13      | to something like that.                                                                                |
| 58:14      | No, but they did add something which I feel is worth mentioning, David, because it is                  |
| 58:21      | all about, you know, the automation side of things.                                                    |
| 58:24      | Something I noticed, I think this must have appeared in a point release on Mac OS Ventura              |
| 58:28      | is there's a checkbox, sorry, Mac OS Monterey, there's a checkbox now for provide output               |
| 58:37      | to your shortcut, because one of the things that people have really struggled with with                |
| 58:41      | shortcuts on the Mac versus shortcuts on iOS is when your shortcut finishes on iOS, whatever's         |
| 58:45      | at the end goes into the next thing.                                                                   |
| 58:48      | Okay, so for example, if you just have a shortcut and you use a run shortcut action, even if           |
| 58:56      | you don't have stop and output result in the shortcut that you use in the run shortcut                 |
| 58:59      | action, you get whatever's at the end.                                                                 |
| 59:01      | So if the last thing is a text box that says amazing automation, then, you know, that's                |
| 59:07      | the thing that you get in the shortcut that uses the run shortcut action.                              |
| 59:12      | Shortcuts on Mac OS does that with shortcuts, but it doesn't do that anywhere else.                    |
| 59:17      | So if you try an output data, you have to use the stop and output option.                              |
| 59:22      | So otherwise, if you have that same shortcut with just a text action at the end, and you               |
| 59:27      | run it on the command line, you run it with [[AppleScript]] on Mac OS, nothing happens.                   |
| 59:33      | You just don't get anything.                                                                           |
| 59:34      | So they've added a checkbox for provide output, and I think this must have appeared in a point         |
| 59:38      | update sometime on Mac OS Monterey.                                                                    |
| 59:41      | Yeah, it happened right as they were right in the summer as I was finishing the Mac                    |
| 59:45      | shortcut field game because I added it because it showed up at the last minute.                        |
| 59:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 59:51      | Yes, yeah.                                                                                             |
| 59:52      | But the provide output option just adds an action to the end of your shortcut, which                   |
| 59:58      | at least for me, as I'm playing with this isn't moving, which is quite nice.                           |
| 01:00:03   | So I can, oh, I can move it up now.                                                                    |
| 01:00:06   | There we go.                                                                                           |
| 01:00:07   | But yeah, it provides like an output result, which means that when you run it on the command           |
| 01:00:12   | line, you run it from somewhere else, you do actually get output back, which means that                |
| 01:00:18   | when you run that shortcut with cable maestro or whatever, then you will actually get output           |
| 01:00:23   | because this is the number one complaint that I've heard with people like shortcuts on the             |
| 01:00:26   | Mac doesn't work.                                                                                      |
| 01:00:27   | It doesn't provide output.                                                                             |
| 01:00:28   | And it's like, no, you have to use a stop and output action.                                           |
| 01:00:32   | Otherwise, you just don't get it.                                                                      |
| 01:00:34   | And yeah, so I'm really glad that that has shown up because that was one of those problems.            |
| 01:00:41   | And they've also snuck in a button for add a keyboard shortcut.                                        |
| 01:00:46   | So you can in the sidebar of any shortcut, you can actually add a keyboard shortcut to                 |
| 01:00:50   | run that keyboard to run that shortcut.                                                                |
| 01:00:53   | But unlike, say, [[Keyboard Maestro]], you can't have like a conflict palette where you just               |
| 01:00:57   | assign everything to a couple of different keyboard shortcuts.                                         |
| 01:01:00   | And that's it, you know, you figure it out from there.                                                 |
| 01:01:05   | You do have to assign a specific keyboard shortcut, which is unique.                                   |
| 01:01:08   | When I tried to assign the same keyboard shortcuts to shortcuts, it didn't complain to me earlier.     |
| 01:01:12   | And I need to test it more with Ventura, but my experience in Monterey was that was not                |
| 01:01:17   | consistent.                                                                                            |
| 01:01:18   | Like you assign the shortcut and sometimes it would trigger and sometimes it wouldn't.                 |
| 01:01:23   | And if you have a keyboard shortcut that only works part of the time, then you might as                |
| 01:01:27   | well not have a keyboard shortcut because you got to depend on that happening.                         |
| 01:01:31   | Whereas with [[Keyboard Maestro]], it's very snappy, you know.                                             |
| 01:01:34   | So it is there.                                                                                        |
| 01:01:36   | I really feel like they're both playing to their strengths, like shortcuts for people                  |
| 01:01:40   | who haven't done a lot of automation, who don't own [[Keyboard Maestro]], shortcuts does                   |
| 01:01:45   | a lot of great stuff and they're easy to build and they're consistent.                                 |
| 01:01:51   | Whereas [[Keyboard Maestro]] is kind of the in case of firebreak last thing where it can                   |
| 01:01:55   | do anything.                                                                                           |
| 01:01:56   | I mean, like, yeah, I still am amazed like that because I have that [[Grammarly]] script                   |
| 01:02:01   | I run and [[Grammarly]] works much better on the internet than it does in the app.                         |
| 01:02:06   | But there is no way to open a new document [[Grammarly]] short of clicking a specific icon                 |
| 01:02:12   | on the screen.                                                                                         |
| 01:02:14   | And it just amazes me every time I run that script and it opens the website, waits a few               |
| 01:02:19   | seconds and then clicks the button for me and then paste the text or in the new document.              |
| 01:02:24   | I mean, it's like, that is so amazing that you can do that.                                            |
| 01:02:28   | Take a screenshot and just tell the computer to click the middle of that screenshot, right?            |
| 01:02:32   | I mean, yeah, find it on the screen no matter where it is and push the button.                         |
| 01:02:36   | It's like, that is automation, baby, that is automation right there.                                   |
| 01:02:40   | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 01:02:41   | Yeah, it really is amazing that you can do things like that.                                           |
| 01:02:44   | Though I'd argue that by not having everything in shortcuts on the Mac, they're actually               |
| 01:02:50   | making it more difficult for those users who are, you know, dipping their toes in the water            |
| 01:02:54   | and splashing around in the shallow puddles trying to start with automation because they've            |
| 01:02:58   | maybe built some shortcuts on their phone.                                                             |
| 01:03:01   | And well, if they were in automation, then that is only on that phone.                                 |
| 01:03:05   | So if they, you know, wipe their device and set it up from new or, you know, they want                 |
| 01:03:11   | to just use the same thing again, they can't actually use it on the Mac or say an iPad.                |
| 01:03:17   | But like, if you then like try and just run with your shortcuts on the Mac, you'll find                |
| 01:03:22   | a lot of missing actions.                                                                              |
| 01:03:25   | And so there's a new action in shortcuts in iOS 16, iPad OS 16, which we should mention                |
| 01:03:31   | is out now as well, along with Mac OS Ventura and Mac OS Ventura.                                      |
| 01:03:38   | And that new action is what is my current focus mode, which, you know, if you need to                  |
| 01:03:43   | work around for on a previous version, focus cuts, see the last episode, but, you know,                |
| 01:03:49   | this is great, except for the fact that that's one of the few actions that's actually made             |
| 01:03:55   | it into shortcuts with Mac OS Ventura that's on iOS.                                                   |
| 01:04:00   | A lot of apps that have got great, awesome new shortcuts actions on iOS and iPad OS seem               |
| 01:04:07   | to be missing them on the Mac.                                                                         |
| 01:04:08   | Like I don't know what's happened if like under the hood inside of the mail team, there's              |
| 01:04:13   | two mail teams, there's Mac OS Mail and there's iOS Mail.                                              |
| 01:04:17   | And nobody's been working on Mac OS Mail for the last year.                                            |
| 01:04:20   | So we don't have new shortcuts support and new reminder support.                                       |
| 01:04:26   | And you know, voice memos is actually now on the Mac.                                                  |
| 01:04:30   | That's a new app as well.                                                                              |
| 01:04:31   | That's great.                                                                                          |
| 01:04:32   | But that's only got a couple of shortcuts actions.                                                     |
| 01:04:34   | It just feels like, you know, we're kind of missing a trick, you know, it took me a while              |
| 01:04:38   | to figure out why my tab groups weren't syncing with [[Safari]] and the answer was I was using             |
| 01:04:43   | [[Safari Technology Preview]], which apparently seemingly doesn't sync tab groups, but the                 |
| 01:04:49   | tab groups do sync with [[Safari]], but there's no shortcut sections for them on Mac OS right              |
| 01:04:54   | now in Mac OS Ventura, the latest release version, as we're talking.                                   |
| 01:05:00   | So I was running the last release candidate before the official release, it certainly                  |
| 01:05:04   | didn't have them.                                                                                      |
| 01:05:05   | And I just feel like by not having these shortcuts actions, you know, they end up causing new          |
| 01:05:12   | users and those not familiar with things, or even those who are familiar with things,                  |
| 01:05:17   | just a bit of grief.                                                                                   |
| 01:05:18   | I had something the other day, I was trying to figure out why, like, why is this bunch                 |
| 01:05:21   | failing?                                                                                               |
| 01:05:22   | And it was because I'd updated the shortcut on iOS and the app had updated on iOS to have              |
| 01:05:27   | also new shortcuts actions, but I couldn't install the update to the app yet for the                   |
| 01:05:32   | Mac because it had to wait for Mac OS Ventura.                                                         |
| 01:05:35   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:05:36   | I can't agree more.                                                                                    |
| 01:05:37   | I mean, it's just like running into those things is really frustrating.                                |
| 01:05:40   | Like, why is this not here?                                                                            |
| 01:05:42   | And but you really talked about two categories of things here, like, for instance, notes               |
| 01:05:47   | got a bunch of great new shortcuts, both on iPhone, iPad and Mac, they brought most of                 |
| 01:05:52   | them over.                                                                                             |
| 01:05:53   | I haven't compared them one for one, but I think they're all there.                                    |
| 01:05:56   | But if not most are there.                                                                             |
| 01:05:58   | But and then [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]], which got a bunch of new features, but didn't get many new shortcut            |
| 01:06:04   | sections, which I got that's confusing to me, but that's kind of across all platforms.                 |
| 01:06:09   | But the more the more vexing one is, like you said, like [[Safari]] having tab actions on                  |
| 01:06:15   | iPhone and iPad, but not having them on the Mac or Mail has a great new action on iPhone,              |
| 01:06:21   | where you can have it open a specific mailbox.                                                         |
| 01:06:24   | Well, that that's a hugely useful shortcut action for people who want to contextually                  |
| 01:06:30   | compute, who want to say, I'm going to work on work now, just open up the erm work box,                 |
| 01:06:34   | the inbox for work, not the inbox for personal, you know, that's great.                                |
| 01:06:38   | Doesn't exist on the Mac.                                                                              |
| 01:06:39   | You know, and I kept thinking, well, when it gets to release, maybe they just need to                  |
| 01:06:43   | sort it out.                                                                                           |
| 01:06:44   | It's, you know, now we're at release and it's still not there.                                         |
| 01:06:46   | And like you can't work around that stuff.                                                             |
| 01:06:48   | Like the Mail one, you can use it.                                                                     |
| 01:06:51   | There's a [[BetterTouchTool]] action to trigger a keyboard shortcut than you then you use the            |
| 01:06:56   | the Mail feature to, you know, use a keyboard shortcut to open the box.                                |
| 01:07:01   | But that's like two or three actions.                                                                  |
| 01:07:03   | It's a point of failure.                                                                               |
| 01:07:05   | Whereas the on the iPhone iPad, you just added the action, I'm starting work mode, open my             |
| 01:07:10   | work inbox, and that's the kind of automation that everybody will use as opposed to nerds              |
| 01:07:15   | like us coming up with these oddball workarounds.                                                      |
| 01:07:18   | And the parody, the lack of parody is concerning.                                                      |
| 01:07:22   | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 01:07:23   | For me, the thing that really stands out here as like the team clearly, the teams clearly              |
| 01:07:29   | either didn't have time for or didn't care about shortcuts for Mac is these apps have                  |
| 01:07:33   | got focus filters, which are there on the Mac too.                                                     |
| 01:07:37   | So my focus filter for [[Safari]] can set the tab group.                                                   |
| 01:07:40   | My focus filter for mail can filter my inboxes.                                                        |
| 01:07:44   | My focus filter for calendar can filter my calendars, but I can't use that or take advantage           |
| 01:07:51   | of that in the shortcuts app.                                                                          |
| 01:07:52   | I have to use my focus filters for that.                                                               |
| 01:07:56   | And it just, yeah, it feels like a little bit of a let down because I really love tab                  |
| 01:08:00   | groups and I really love the fact that you can activate certain tab groups and so on.                  |
| 01:08:05   | But I click on mail and the four actions I've got are email address, kind of not really                |
| 01:08:11   | in action folks, get email addresses from input and select email address and set mail                  |
| 01:08:17   | focus filter.                                                                                          |
| 01:08:18   | Like great.                                                                                            |
| 01:08:20   | Thanks.                                                                                                |
| 01:08:21   | You know, this is exactly what I was looking for everybody.                                            |
| 01:08:24   | I know exactly what I want.                                                                            |
| 01:08:25   | And that bug is still present as well where if you search for an action on iOS in shortcuts            |
| 01:08:32   | David, I don't know if you've noticed this.                                                            |
| 01:08:33   | So if you search for an action and so say, for example, you search for the name of an                  |
| 01:08:37   | app.                                                                                                   |
| 01:08:38   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:08:39   | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 01:08:40   | And then you tap on the name of the app.                                                               |
| 01:08:41   | Then you see all of the shortcuts actions for that app.                                                |
| 01:08:44   | Now go and do the same search in shortcuts on your Mac.                                                |
| 01:08:48   | I don't trust that.                                                                                    |
| 01:08:49   | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 01:08:50   | I just don't trust that.                                                                               |
| 01:08:51   | No, no, no.                                                                                            |
| 01:08:52   | And then, and then what it does.                                                                       |
| 01:08:53   | Wait, on iOS, you tap the clear and it like retains like, or as you know, when you tap                 |
| 01:08:57   | on the app, it shows you all the shortcuts actions for that app on Mac OS, it keeps the                |
| 01:09:01   | search so that you only see the actions that have like your search term in, even though                |
| 01:09:07   | you selected the app.                                                                                  |
| 01:09:08   | And then when you clear the search, it removes your app selection as well.                             |
| 01:09:13   | And yeah, this drives me a little bit crazy when I'm searching for apps on the Mac or                  |
| 01:09:19   | our actions because, you know, I've got a long list of apps.                                           |
| 01:09:22   | It doesn't necessarily have everything in it.                                                          |
| 01:09:24   | It feels like they may have fixed this slightly in the fact that it now appears to be returning        |
| 01:09:31   | all of the actions all of the time.                                                                    |
| 01:09:35   | That said, I'm not 100% confident it is.                                                               |
| 01:09:37   | And I just want to know that I'm getting a list of all of the actions for the app.                     |
| 01:09:42   | And yeah, it drives me crazy that there's like a difference between these.                             |
| 01:09:46   | And I know that it's just, that's how this works on iOS and that's how this works on                   |
| 01:09:50   | Mac OS.                                                                                                |
| 01:09:51   | Like they're just using the defaults, but it feels like maybe somebody at Apple needs                  |
| 01:09:56   | to go, hey, the way we do things on Mac OS and iOS is totally different.                               |
| 01:10:00   | We should take a look at this because it's confusing our users.                                        |
| 01:10:03   | Would you like a ray of sunshine?                                                                      |
| 01:10:04   | Would you like a ray of sunshine?                                                                      |
| 01:10:05   | I would love, I would love some sunshine.                                                              |
| 01:10:07   | Yes, please.                                                                                           |
| 01:10:08   | What do we got?                                                                                        |
| 01:10:09   | If you look at the Delta, the difference between the Mac and the iPhone and iPad versions of           |
| 01:10:14   | shortcuts a year ago versus now, it's much smaller.                                                    |
| 01:10:18   | And I don't think this is that they don't care.                                                        |
| 01:10:20   | I think it's just trying to keep up.                                                                   |
| 01:10:22   | And yeah, I feel like it's one of those things that as apps have taken ownership for their             |
| 01:10:27   | own shortcuts actions, it's become something that they have to put on their internal radar             |
| 01:10:34   | versus telling somebody who would hopefully tell somebody else who would make the thing                |
| 01:10:39   | happen.                                                                                                |
| 01:10:40   | And to be clear, I don't know that, for example, the mail team is responsible for their own            |
| 01:10:46   | shortcuts actions, but it feels to me like that's the only way that this can work long                 |
| 01:10:50   | term.                                                                                                  |
| 01:10:51   | One of the things that shortcuts did after being bought by Apple as workflow and made                  |
| 01:10:57   | into shortcuts was, okay, developers, here's how you make your own actions.                            |
| 01:11:02   | You go to the difficult work on your end of figuring out what it is and how it works and               |
| 01:11:07   | we'll provide all of the links between all of the things to connect it all together.                   |
| 01:11:13   | And yeah, I mean, obviously, everybody has different priorities, but it's just a little                |
| 01:11:19   | sad to me that when we get something so great on iOS, then you go and look at the new macOS            |
| 01:11:23   | and you're all excited and shiny and oh, no, none yet, darn.                                           |
| 01:11:29   | But it is great seeing how many third party developers have been making some great new                 |
| 01:11:34   | shortcuts actions.                                                                                     |
| 01:11:36   | So Agenda's got an update coming out, Fingers crossed for macOS Ventura, I think they were             |
| 01:11:41   | saying on their forums, which has got some new shortcuts actions and so on in.                         |
| 01:11:47   | And those I've already seen and been using on iOS and that's good.                                     |
| 01:11:51   | Omni Group have got all of their new stuff coming out, [[BBEdit]] as well.                                 |
| 01:11:56   | All of the app developers who have shortcut supporters are looking to see what they can                |
| 01:12:01   | do to take advantage of this and a lot of developers have found they've done the work                  |
| 01:12:05   | for the focus mode filters and everything on iOS.                                                      |
| 01:12:08   | You get that on the Mac too, and especially with iPadOS 16 coming out, it's worth mentioning           |
| 01:12:13   | that the focus filters are a per device thing that you'll need to configure.                           |
| 01:12:18   | So if you've got an iPhone and an iPad and a Mac, you'll need to set like your mail focus              |
| 01:12:23   | filter on each device so that you just focus on your work mail on all of your devices if               |
| 01:12:30   | that's what you want to do.                                                                            |
| 01:12:32   | But I like that.                                                                                       |
| 01:12:34   | I personally think that that is a good thing because you can then take advantage of your               |
| 01:12:39   | shortcuts which set your focus filters for your different apps so that you can have something          |
| 01:12:49   | that will say, okay, this is what I want my work focus filter to be for mail on all of                 |
| 01:12:55   | my devices.                                                                                            |
| 01:12:56   | And so you can create like your shortcut setup and run it and you can run it on each device.           |
| 01:13:02   | And I really, really like that.                                                                        |
| 01:13:04   | It took me a while to figure out what the use case for the set my focus filter action                  |
| 01:13:08   | was, but I think that's it.                                                                            |
| 01:13:11   | You have set up my work focus filters and so you sit down and you do it on one device                  |
| 01:13:15   | in shortcuts and then you run it on each device and boom, that's it.                                   |
| 01:13:18   | You're configured everywhere the same way.                                                             |
| 01:13:21   | And then you want to tweak it.                                                                         |
| 01:13:22   | You tweak it in one place and you can update it on all of your devices.                                |
| 01:13:25   | But if you want one device that doesn't use focus filters, that's easy enough to handle.               |
| 01:13:29   | You just don't run the shortcut there.                                                                 |
| 01:13:30   | You don't set it up simple.                                                                            |

| 01:15:40   | All right, so we teach [[Stage Manager]] at the beginning of the episode.                                  |
| 01:15:46   | Let's talk about that.                                                                                 |
| 01:15:47   | I guess I want to talk generally about [[Stage Manager]], but also the automation angle.                   |
| 01:15:52   | Let's start with [[Stage Manager]].                                                                        |
| 01:15:54   | Did you turn it on or are you using it?                                                                |
| 01:15:56   | I'm sure you've been testing it.                                                                       |
| 01:15:58   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:59   | I turned it on when I first got the iPadOS beta, it took me a little longer to install                 |
| 01:16:04   | the macOS beta.                                                                                        |
| 01:16:05   | I tried it for a couple of hours and went, not sure about this and kind of just abandoned              |
| 01:16:10   | it for a while.                                                                                        |
| 01:16:12   | But recently I've been getting back into it more and more and this has been held by reports            |
| 01:16:17   | from various different people saying like, hey, this is a lot better.                                  |
| 01:16:23   | And it's a very different way of working, which took a while for me to wrap my head around.            |
| 01:16:29   | But I have to say, I'm liking it generally.                                                            |
| 01:16:33   | It's not necessarily the way that I have worked before or used to work or anything, but it's           |
| 01:16:40   | a different way of working.                                                                            |
| 01:16:43   | And I've found that for certain things, it works very nicely to have that, especially                  |
| 01:16:48   | when you want several different apps open on your iPad at the same time.                               |
| 01:16:53   | Like a classic one for me is if I'm having a conversation with somebody via messages,                  |
| 01:16:58   | but I also need to be taking notes about something and researching something in [[Safari]].                |
| 01:17:04   | So we're researching stuff and chatting back and forth and sending each other links and                |
| 01:17:09   | making our own notes about it.                                                                         |
| 01:17:11   | That's something where I will want three apps open and I want to be able to see probably               |
| 01:17:16   | around about 50% [[Safari]], 40% notes and 10% mail.                                                       |
| 01:17:20   | So what I can do is I can have messages open and I can kind of put it behind [[Safari]] and                |
| 01:17:25   | notes or [[Drafts]] in my case and then have [[Safari]] and [[Drafts]] floating on top and tap between             |
| 01:17:33   | them.                                                                                                  |
| 01:17:34   | And then when I see a message come in at the bottom from somebody, I can be reading the                |
| 01:17:37   | whole message without having to just read it from the notification and then pull down                  |
| 01:17:41   | and interact with the notification.                                                                    |
| 01:17:44   | And I can tap into it to reply or just drag a tab over into it and that works really,                  |
| 01:17:50   | really well.                                                                                           |
| 01:17:51   | So I've been trying it a little on macOS as well.                                                      |
| 01:17:54   | I'm not doing as well on macOS as I have been on iOS, but I think that's partially because             |
| 01:18:00   | on iOS, I like the fact that the camera for various apps keeps working in the background               |
| 01:18:06   | and that's always been the case on macOS, so that's been less of a problem for me.                     |
| 01:18:10   | But I feel like I am finding ways to use it that I couldn't find before, but maybe that's              |
| 01:18:17   | just because it's much more mac-like on iOS or iPadOS in some ways.                                    |
| 01:18:23   | What about you, David?                                                                                 |
| 01:18:24   | All right.                                                                                             |
| 01:18:25   | Lots to unpack there.                                                                                  |
| 01:18:26   | I feel like you're right with respect to iPadOS.                                                       |
| 01:18:29   | Window management has always been a thorny thing where there really wasn't a good answer.              |
| 01:18:34   | And I was thinking going into it that this will be great.                                              |
| 01:18:37   | I can tile my common apps and put them together.                                                       |
| 01:18:42   | For me, a good test of all this is communications.                                                     |
| 01:18:46   | I do not want to see my email or my text message app open when I'm working.                            |
| 01:18:52   | So on the Mac, historically, I keep a space with all that stuff in it and then I intentionally         |
| 01:18:59   | go to that screen.                                                                                     |
| 01:19:01   | It's not like mail is just there.                                                                      |
| 01:19:02   | It shows up when I go to the mail space.                                                               |
| 01:19:05   | I thought, well, on the iPad, that would be nice.                                                      |
| 01:19:07   | But something I learned is, number one, you can group them together in a space, which                  |
| 01:19:10   | is great.                                                                                              |
| 01:19:11   | But I did not want tiling after I started using it.                                                    |
| 01:19:14   | It's more of a layering like you were talking about.                                                   |
| 01:19:17   | That actually is really useful.                                                                        |
| 01:19:19   | I think it's good.                                                                                     |
| 01:19:21   | I feel like [[Stage Manager]] has taken a lot of heat from the echo chamber of Apple people.               |
| 01:19:29   | I think it's better than people are giving it credit for it, but it does give you that                 |
| 01:19:33   | ability to set certain segments of apps.                                                               |
| 01:19:36   | That's great.                                                                                          |
| 01:19:37   | I'm still not exactly sure how I'm going to use it on the iPad.                                        |
| 01:19:40   | I think I will end up using it on the iPad, though, because there really isn't any other               |
| 01:19:43   | options where on the Mac, there are so many options.                                                   |
| 01:19:47   | You've got spaces.                                                                                     |
| 01:19:52   | Apple has tried all these different window management systems over the years and they've               |
| 01:19:56   | just left them all in.                                                                                 |
| 01:19:57   | This is one more of several, and then there's third-party apps too, like [[Moom]] and these                |
| 01:20:01   | other apps you can use to arrange windows and automate a bunch of this stuff.                          |
| 01:20:06   | You really have a lot of options.                                                                      |
| 01:20:08   | You keep talking about Bunch.                                                                          |
| 01:20:09   | Bunch really is another option for doing this kind of stuff.                                           |
| 01:20:13   | I feel like this is one among many options.                                                            |
| 01:20:16   | I think for people who are not super into the geeky stuff, having one option that is                   |
| 01:20:23   | common to both iPad and Mac is a great idea.                                                           |
| 01:20:26   | I think about my wife, she is the person in my life who is a typical user of this stuff.               |
| 01:20:34   | She likes it.                                                                                          |
| 01:20:35   | She wants to be productive, but she's not going to listen to the automators.                           |
| 01:20:38   | I think for her, having a common frame of reference that you have, the little magic                    |
| 01:20:43   | groupings of apps on the side of the screen, you click it and all your window setups change,           |
| 01:20:48   | that makes a lot more sense to her than something like [[Spaces]] does.                                    |
| 01:20:51   | I think for basic to medium users, I think it's going to be a big win.                                 |
| 01:20:58   | There's also things on the Mac I like better about it, though, because I think one of the              |
| 01:21:03   | things you can do on Mac that people don't realise you can combine these things.                       |
| 01:21:07   | I still have a comms space, but with Mission, I'm sorry, with [[Stage Manager]] on it, right?              |
| 01:21:13   | Yeah, I'm sorry.                                                                                       |
| 01:21:14   | I'm talking too many different things.                                                                 |
| 01:21:16   | With [[Stage Manager]] enabled, I can actually have that page change its setup based on what               |
| 01:21:21   | I'm doing.                                                                                             |
| 01:21:23   | Social media is a thing.                                                                               |
| 01:21:24   | I have a [[Discord]] server for the MacSparky Labs, and I have [[Twitter]], and I have different              |
| 01:21:29   | social media things.                                                                                   |
| 01:21:30   | Well, if I want to work on social media, I can have [[Stage Manager]] create a grouping of                 |
| 01:21:34   | that on my comms page, whereas if I want to grind through email, it's something different.             |
| 01:21:40   | I actually find that that is useful to me.                                                             |
| 01:21:43   | Another thing people, I think, aren't realising, or maybe you realise it, but you just haven't         |
| 01:21:47   | tried it, is that the [[Stage Manager]] groupings can be turned off, so you only see them when             |
| 01:21:53   | you mouse to the far left or right of the screen.                                                      |
| 01:21:56   | Or even if they aren't turned off, if you use window management to put your window over                |
| 01:22:01   | where the [[Stage Manager]] groupings are, they slide out of the way.                                      |
| 01:22:06   | They don't overlap your active window.                                                                 |
| 01:22:09   | Then the way you access them, once again, is mouse over to that side.                                  |
| 01:22:13   | There really are a lot of options with this, which is great.                                           |
| 01:22:17   | I would encourage people to really give it a try for two months, not a day, but really                 |
| 01:22:23   | try and fold it in and see how you can do it.                                                          |
| 01:22:26   | Combine it with spaces if you're a nerd like me, and it gets even better, because having               |
| 01:22:32   | a space to certain types of commuting, computing, but the ability to accurately rearrange those        |
| 01:22:39   | spaces at will is great.                                                                               |
| 01:22:41   | Another one for me is a planning space with things like OmniFocus and calendars and things             |
| 01:22:46   | like that.                                                                                             |
| 01:22:47   | Whereas when I'm actually writing and doing work and production work, I don't need to                  |
| 01:22:50   | have that in my active space, and I find that useful.                                                  |
| 01:22:55   | Where it falls down is the subject of the show, automation.                                            |
| 01:22:59   | It is not nearly friendly enough with automation tools.                                                |
| 01:23:04   | I find it funny that actually, if you look, I can't find the page now that I saw where                 |
| 01:23:10   | Apple were talking about this, but they said, it's the automated way of doing window management.       |
| 01:23:20   | Where's the automation side of it?                                                                     |
| 01:23:22   | Because there is no shortcut support, and it seems like it's kind of like it remembers                 |
| 01:23:31   | stuff, but it just doesn't feel like you can push things into it particularly easily.                  |
| 01:23:38   | One thing I have found as a side note that I should mention specifically on macOS, I've                |
| 01:23:42   | not yet found a way to fix this on the iPad, is if you click the [[Stage Manager]] icon in                 |
| 01:23:47   | the menu bar, and then you click [[Stage Manager]] settings, there's an option to show windows             |
| 01:23:53   | from an application.                                                                                   |
| 01:23:54   | I've changed it from all at once to one at a time.                                                     |
| 01:23:58   | That has made this much more Mac-like for me, because one of the things we had when we                 |
| 01:24:03   | were preparing the show today, David, is you found that you were trying to open a shortcut,            |
| 01:24:09   | and it was like putting you in the wrong [[Stage Manager]], and it was in the wrong window.                |
| 01:24:16   | Being able to deal with them one at a time, what happens?                                              |
| 01:24:23   | It doesn't quite work the exact same way that you'd expect, but it puts a little stack                 |
| 01:24:29   | of that app icons in the left menu, but then you can easily drag one of them into the space            |
| 01:24:34   | that you want to be in.                                                                                |
| 01:24:39   | That for me is an improvement at any rate, so that I can easily combine the two things                 |
| 01:24:46   | that I need together.                                                                                  |
| 01:24:48   | I've got now on that Mac, I've got a shortcut and OmniFocus open on the same [[Stage Manager]]             |
| 01:24:54   | view.                                                                                                  |
| 01:24:56   | It is a little bit strange, I find it works a little better when the dock ends up being                |
| 01:25:00   | hidden.                                                                                                |
| 01:25:03   | That's something to bear in mind, but it's a little weird that they have called it the                 |
| 01:25:11   | automated way of window management, and it doesn't feel very automated.                                |
| 01:25:18   | It should have a clear, usable set of shortcuts to navigate.                                           |
| 01:25:23   | It should have the ability to address it via shortcuts.                                                |
| 01:25:28   | This is the same problem with spaces.                                                                  |
| 01:25:31   | It's just not addressable as an automation tool, and that makes using it more effectively              |
| 01:25:38   | way harder.                                                                                            |
| 01:25:40   | Getting back to my idea of workspaces customised to the type of work you're doing, I should            |
| 01:25:45   | be able to jump to a space or to a [[Stage Manager]] grouping when I want to do that type of work.         |
| 01:25:51   | I don't know.                                                                                          |
| 01:25:52   | One of the problems I can see is that how does it know which one you want?                             |
| 01:25:57   | It doesn't give you the ability to name groupings.                                                     |
| 01:25:59   | Maybe they need to add some more underlying user-addressable identification to it.                     |
| 01:26:06   | This is Apple.                                                                                         |
| 01:26:07   | It's a solvable problem, and it doesn't seem like they're trying to solve it.                          |
| 01:26:11   | That's the part I don't understand.                                                                    |
| 01:26:13   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:26:14   | It's one of those things.                                                                              |
| 01:26:15   | If you go into the system settings app, which was system preferences before, and you click             |
| 01:26:20   | on desktop and dock, then if you scroll down a little bit, you do see [[Stage Manager]], and               |
| 01:26:24   | you can toggle that on and off, and you can click customise, which opens the same options              |
| 01:26:28   | that you get from the menu bar.                                                                        |
| 01:26:31   | It kind of feels like, well, I'm in here, oh, hey, mission control.                                    |
| 01:26:36   | Then I see automatically rearranged spaces based on most recent use.                                   |
| 01:26:40   | No, if spaces are previously frustrated, you make sure that setting is off.                            |
| 01:26:45   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:26:46   | Yeah, the most confusing thing, and then you see displays have got separate spaces and                 |
| 01:26:54   | stuff like that, and so you look at this, and then you see shortcuts, and you click                    |
| 01:26:59   | on shortcuts, and then you see show desktop, now shortcut for show desktop.                            |
| 01:27:05   | Okay, cool.                                                                                            |
| 01:27:06   | Mission control, keyboard shortcut, application windows, keyboard shortcut, wait, where did            |
| 01:27:10   | [[Stage Manager]] go?                                                                                      |
| 01:27:11   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:27:12   | Isn't there a more button here or something?                                                           |
| 01:27:14   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:27:15   | I scroll up and down, which on a 13-inch laptop gives me a little bit of animation, and it             |
| 01:27:20   | moves the keyboard and mouse shortcuts, text to the top of the window, and I see exactly               |
| 01:27:25   | zero more options.                                                                                     |
| 01:27:27   | So I think, okay, great.                                                                               |
| 01:27:29   | This is macOS system preferences, so maybe it's hidden under keyboard.                                 |
| 01:27:33   | So I go into keyboard, and I click on the keyboard shortcuts button, and I think, okay, maybe          |
| 01:27:38   | it's under display.                                                                                    |
| 01:27:39   | Nope.                                                                                                  |
| 01:27:40   | Nope.                                                                                                  |
| 01:27:41   | Mission control.                                                                                       |
| 01:27:42   | No, not seeing it there.                                                                               |
| 01:27:45   | Should it be under spotlight?                                                                          |
| 01:27:46   | No, because I can't find these mission control spaces through spotlight either.                        |
| 01:27:51   | And then I go, okay, app shortcuts.                                                                    |
| 01:27:52   | I'll click on a plus and add a new shortcut for mission control.                                       |
| 01:27:56   | Only mission control is not listed in the applications.                                                |
| 01:27:59   | So, sorry, mission control is, but [[Stage Manager]] isn't, and it just, I don't know, it feels            |
| 01:28:07   | like somebody's missed something there.                                                                |
| 01:28:09   | It feels like the same people who did spaces have done [[Stage Manager]], and then they've been            |
| 01:28:14   | told, like, they've got, like, to a point where it's like, okay, this could be a really                |
| 01:28:18   | great and useful and interesting feature.                                                              |
| 01:28:20   | You just need to add, like, some keyboard shortcuts and an API for it, and they've been                |
| 01:28:24   | told, nope, sorry, that's it.                                                                          |
| 01:28:26   | We are reassigning you to another project.                                                             |
| 01:28:28   | Thank you very much.                                                                                   |
| 01:28:29   | Have a nice day.                                                                                       |
| 01:28:30   | You know, and yeah, I just, I wish, like, there were easier ways to integrate with this stuff.         |
| 01:28:36   | Like, how do I change applications in [[Stage Manager]] with a keyboard?                                   |
| 01:28:41   | To make it more baffling on the iPad, they have keyboard shortcuts, not a lot, but, like,              |
| 01:28:46   | the function left and right arrow move between what they call window groups, which is stage            |
| 01:28:50   | manager groups.                                                                                        |
| 01:28:52   | But that keyboard function doesn't work on the Mac, you know?                                          |
| 01:28:56   | No, because function left and right arrow does something different on the Mac.                         |
| 01:29:00   | Or wait, was it, like, maybe control left and right arrow or option left and right arrow?              |
| 01:29:04   | It doesn't matter.                                                                                     |
| 01:29:05   | But yeah, like, those, those keyboard shortcuts are either reserved in various Mac apps or             |
| 01:29:09   | just, you know, not available.                                                                         |
| 01:29:13   | And so you have to then use your mouse, unless you use command tab to navigate between applications    |
| 01:29:18   | and some applications, but not all, will let you use control tab to navigate to different              |
| 01:29:24   | windows or tabs within that application.                                                               |
| 01:29:27   | But as far as I can tell, there's no window grouping shortcut on the Mac, where you can                |
| 01:29:33   | use a keyboard shortcut to jump between one and another.                                               |
| 01:29:36   | No.                                                                                                    |
| 01:29:37   | So it is odd, you know?                                                                                |
| 01:29:39   | Um, but they, I don't know, but it's early days.                                                       |
| 01:29:42   | So hopefully that's on the whiteboard somewhere.                                                       |
| 01:29:44   | I guess if we're a year from now and they still know automation functions, I'll be sad                 |
| 01:29:48   | because I feel like this just calls for, you know, I mean, if you really want to do stuff              |
| 01:29:53   | like contextual computing and make your computer dance for you and take advantage of these             |
| 01:29:57   | cool features, you need a way to automate it.                                                          |
| 01:30:00   | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 01:30:01   | Yeah, you do.                                                                                          |
| 01:30:02   | Um, one thing I didn't check, which I should check, so I'm going to look now, uh, is whether           |
| 01:30:07   | or not there were hot corners for [[Stage Manager]].                                                       |
| 01:30:10   | Um, and I can see there's a lot of hot corners, uh, still locking your screen, putting your            |
| 01:30:15   | display to sleep and, uh, display screensaver.                                                         |
| 01:30:18   | All of my, um, hot corners have been duplicated by the way, David.                                     |
| 01:30:22   | So like if I press the command key, then apparently like I can have it do, uh, one thing, but          |
| 01:30:28   | uh, I'm not seeing, uh, [[Stage Manager]] in here.                                                         |
| 01:30:31   | I've got mission control and I've got application windows and the desktop, um, or notification         |
| 01:30:36   | centre or launch pad.                                                                                  |
| 01:30:37   | But that seems to be as close to stage management as we get in, uh, uh, you know, that sort            |
| 01:30:43   | of thing.                                                                                              |
| 01:30:44   | And I think that's the thing.                                                                          |
| 01:30:45   | It's kind of a mishmash between all of, uh, all of things with some extra stuff on top.                |
| 01:30:50   | And it looks really great.                                                                             |
| 01:30:51   | And I'm really like intrigued by it.                                                                   |
| 01:30:53   | And I have to say the shortcut sections work pretty well.                                              |
| 01:30:56   | Like open this application, um, and, um, like, uh, it's still set to split screen, um, with            |
| 01:31:03   | this other application, but that works as [[Stage Manager]] too.                                           |
| 01:31:06   | Like that's fine.                                                                                      |
| 01:31:07   | That, that works pretty well, but yeah, I think that's kind of as close as we've managed               |
| 01:31:11   | to get though, uh, the mission control actions for, um, moving windows, finding windows and            |
| 01:31:16   | so on.                                                                                                 |
| 01:31:17   | They work with [[Stage Manager]] enabled mostly, um, I've, I've had a couple of crashes, but               |
| 01:31:21   | I think that, you know, there's a lot of moving pieces when you're on a beta.                          |
| 01:31:25   | So I can't say that that shortcuts or that's mission control or Mac OS, it could have been             |
| 01:31:29   | all, all of the above.                                                                                 |
| 01:31:31   | Um, so yeah, but, uh, it's, I'm hoping maybe, maybe we'll get a point one release, David               |
| 01:31:37   | and they'll have gone, Oh, we listen to automators.                                                    |
| 01:31:39   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:31:40   | Add shortcuts actions for all the things.                                                              |
| 01:31:41   | It's had an API, so that bunch and [[Keyboard Maestro]] and all the other things can integrate             |
| 01:31:45   | with this stuff.                                                                                       |
| 01:31:46   | Uh, if you're listening and you do that, thank you very much.                                          |
| 01:31:48   | But, uh, if not, we're just going to all have to cross our fingers and sit and wait and                |
| 01:31:51   | see.                                                                                                   |
| 01:31:52   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:31:53   | One of the, the little hacks I've done using [[Stage Manager]] for window placement, because               |
| 01:31:57   | I still use moon for window placement.                                                                 |
| 01:31:59   | It's just so easy.                                                                                     |
| 01:32:00   | Um, but, you know, your traditional window sizes that go to the edge of the screen will,               |
| 01:32:08   | you know, move [[Stage Manager]] off the screen and sometimes you want to do that.                         |
| 01:32:12   | Sometimes you don't.                                                                                   |
| 01:32:13   | So I've added extra moon shortcuts, some of which resize the stuff going to the left                   |
| 01:32:18   | slightly, not all the way to the left.                                                                 |
| 01:32:21   | And, uh, I can just very quickly jump between like full left or partial left.                          |
| 01:32:25   | If I want to be able to see the [[Stage Manager]] stuff show up.                                           |
| 01:32:28   | So yes.                                                                                                |
| 01:32:29   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:32:30   | That's the obvious little thing, but that, that's like, that's the automation I'm doing                |
| 01:32:33   | with it.                                                                                               |
| 01:32:34   | It's like using other apps to, uh, you know, reset windows so it still works, but actually             |
| 01:32:39   | getting between window groupings is what I want and I want to be able to address them                  |
| 01:32:44   | and just say, yeah, I want the, uh, writing window grouping to show up and everything                  |
| 01:32:49   | else to go away.                                                                                       |
| 01:32:50   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:32:51   | It seems such a great idea.                                                                            |
| 01:32:53   | And it's like, you're almost there.                                                                    |
| 01:32:55   | I mean, imagine.                                                                                       |
| 01:32:56   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:32:57   | And I'm complaining.                                                                                   |
| 01:32:58   | Let me just go over to the mouse and click it, right?                                                  |
| 01:33:00   | You know, it's not the end of the world, but it's like, but why not?                                   |
| 01:33:04   | Why not give us that?                                                                                  |
| 01:33:05   | You know, well, the thing that really strikes me is it would be really great to tie this               |
| 01:33:09   | into, um, focus modes with tab groups and things like that.                                            |
| 01:33:13   | So that I could have or, or not even focus modes, but just things like tab groups and                  |
| 01:33:19   | notes folders and things like that, where I could say, Hey, uh, so this is my mission                  |
| 01:33:24   | control group for this thing and it features this [[Safari]] tab group.                                    |
| 01:33:29   | Um, and it's got, you know, this notes folder and this OmniFocus, uh, pro folder or project           |
| 01:33:35   | or whatever and things like that, you know, that would be really amazing.                              |
| 01:33:38   | And you can kind of get partial part of the way there because you can have shortcuts open              |
| 01:33:43   | [[Safari]] and then you can use cube of my shirt to click at a particular image and [[Safari]]                 |
| 01:33:48   | to open the tab group that you wanted, um, which, you know, not great.                                 |
| 01:33:53   | But, you know, if you, if you use the tab groups, um, actions on iPad OS, that's okay.                 |
| 01:33:59   | Um, you can open that, but it, it just, yeah, it feels like it's almost there so close to              |
| 01:34:04   | almost.                                                                                                |
| 01:34:05   | And I mean, the thing that I would really love David, I, I really desperately want this                |
| 01:34:10   | is a, I want these to sync.                                                                            |
| 01:34:14   | I want my mission control to be able to, to work between devices so I can have, or sorry,              |
| 01:34:22   | my [[Stage Manager]] to work so I can have a stage, but it's a portable stage, you know, why can't         |
| 01:34:27   | I take it with me?                                                                                     |
| 01:34:28   | And I know stages develop into theatres, theatres don't fit in your pocket.                            |
| 01:34:32   | Um, but this is Apple, they make anything happen.                                                      |
| 01:34:34   | So it would be great if they could, you know, make [[Stage Manager]] at least somewhat portable.           |
| 01:34:38   | Um, you know, and if somebody at Apple listens to that idea and goes, well, yeah, but what             |
| 01:34:44   | if you don't have the same apps installed, um, on your Macs, um, I'd like to point out                 |
| 01:34:47   | that shortcuts for iOS doesn't guarantee that you have the same shortcuts installed, um,               |
| 01:34:52   | across your iOS and iPad OS devices.                                                                   |
| 01:34:55   | And you know, it's doing fine.                                                                         |
| 01:34:57   | So why not give me the option and just put a little asterisk of, you know, applications                |
| 01:35:02   | not present on other devices will not show in stage, in stages.                                        |
| 01:35:05   | Well, also, I mean, another, if we're going to dream here, I would like to assemble them               |
| 01:35:10   | with automation and say, you know, get, get, uh, [[OmniFocus]] and Fantastical and put them             |
| 01:35:16   | together in a window grouping.                                                                         |
| 01:35:19   | Yep.                                                                                                   |
| 01:35:20   | And rather than me having to construct it manually, and it's not that big of a deal,                   |
| 01:35:24   | but once you add automation, it gets so much better.                                                   |
| 01:35:27   | That's why we make this show, you know, um, so, you know, there's, there's work to be                  |
| 01:35:30   | done there.                                                                                            |
| 01:35:31   | I guess that's what we're, I don't think the feature itself is necessarily a dud, but                  |
| 01:35:36   | I do think that, um, it needs work and I'd like to see the automation end of it, get                   |
| 01:35:43   | some, get some love, you know, and it's just not there yet.                                            |
| 01:35:45   | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                         |
| 01:35:46   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:35:47   | Either way, we're the automators.                                                                      |
