| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators,                                              |
| 00:04      | the automation podcast where we talk about grabbing                            |
| 00:06      | your technology and teaching it to do your bidding for you.                    |
| 00:09      | My name is Rosemary Orchard,                                                   |
| 00:11      | and I'm joined as always by my cat,                                            |
| 00:13      | pal and co-host, David Sparks.                                                 |
| 00:14      | Hey, David, how are you?                                                       |
| 00:15      | I'm great, Rose.                                                               |
| 00:17      | I'm very excited.                                                              |
| 00:19      | After this show publishes,                                                     |
| 00:21      | I'm going to be seeing you the next day in London.                             |
| 00:25      | So that's going to be really fun.                                              |
| 00:26      | I get to give you a hug and see you again.                                     |
| 00:29      | It's been so long.                                                             |
| 00:30      | When's the last time we saw each other in person?                              |
| 00:33      | I think it was before COVID.                                                   |
| 00:35      | Yeah, I think it was.                                                          |
| 00:37      | I think it may have been the [[WWDC]] before COVID.                            |
| 00:40      | Yeah, it's just one of those things.                                           |
| 00:42      | When we're not flying back and forth around the world,                         |
| 00:45      | it's kind of difficult to stay in touch in person,                             |
| 00:48      | but at the same time, we managed to do a pretty good job                       |
| 00:50      | of it online, which is always nice.                                            |
| 00:52      | Yeah, well, we're the Automators podcast                                       |
| 00:54      | where we like to talk about automation,                                        |
| 00:56      | and we love the theme that anyone can automate.                                |
| 00:58      | And I have been hearing from a listener                                        |
| 01:02      | over the last couple of years now,                                             |
| 01:05      | Kim Caloca-Madden, welcome to the show.                                        |
| 01:08      | Hi, thank you for having me.                                                   |
| 01:10      | So Kim and I started this email thread.                                        |
| 01:12      | I don't know how long ago it goes, Kim,                                        |
| 01:14      | but she would just send me ideas and things                                    |
| 01:17      | she was doing as a mom with automation.                                        |
| 01:20      | And as the months and years went by,                                           |
| 01:23      | these automations got more and more complex and cool.                          |
| 01:27      | And at some point, I said, Kim,                                                |
| 01:30      | you have to come on the Automators                                             |
| 01:32      | and share all this with us.                                                    |
| 01:32      | And she was so kind to do it.                                                  |
| 01:34      | So welcome to the show, Kim.                                                   |
| 01:36      | Yeah, thanks so much.                                                          |
| 01:37      | As what happened was I kept listening to Automators                            |
| 01:41      | and learning more and more and got better at my automation.                    |
| 01:43      | So that's how they got more fancy.                                             |
| 01:45      | That's what we want.                                                           |
| 01:46      | That's exactly the goal.                                                       |
| 01:48      | But Kim, tell us a little bit about yourself.                                  |
| 01:51      | Well, I am a work from home mom.                                               |
| 01:54      | So I started a business for myself                                             |
| 01:57      | after I divorced my now ex-husband.                                            |
| 02:00      | And I had a three-year-old who I was a stay-at-home mom                        |
| 02:04      | and I didn't want to put him in daycare.                                       |
| 02:07      | And I wanted to spend as much time with him as I could.                        |
| 02:10      | So I had started a little business from my home                                |
| 02:13      | doing virtual assisting administrative support                                 |
| 02:16      | for people who have online businesses.                                         |
| 02:19      | And learning as I went through that,                                           |
| 02:23      | I started to get into automation,                                              |
| 02:26      | a lot of web-based automation, email marketing automation,                     |
| 02:28      | things like that.                                                              |
| 02:30      | And then as my business grew, so did my family.                                |
| 02:33      | I got remarried, had another child.                                            |
| 02:35      | So we have a big eight-year age gap                                            |
| 02:37      | which keeps life really interesting,                                           |
| 02:39      | having a teenager and a six-year-old in the house.                             |
| 02:42      | And when I'm not running my business,                                          |
| 02:44      | I'm chasing them around or wrangling our dogs and cats.                        |
| 02:49      | And automating.                                                                |
| 02:50      | And automating.                                                                |
| 02:51      | Automating as much as I can.                                                   |
| 02:53      | I think as well, there's things where you,                                     |
| 02:55      | once you've realised that something you're doing,                              |
| 02:58      | you can make it a little bit easier for yourself                               |
| 03:00      | or a little bit faster.                                                        |
| 03:01      | Most people are inclined to go that way.                                       |
| 03:02      | So I'm glad to see here that you recognise                                     |
| 03:06      | that there was automation for a lot of this stuff                              |
| 03:10      | because things like email newsletters and so on,                               |
| 03:12      | a lot of that system,                                                          |
| 03:13      | that does run with a bunch of automation,                                      |
| 03:16      | but that tends to be on the other side                                         |
| 03:18      | to the people who are sending the emails.                                      |
| 03:21      | The people who are sending the emails                                          |
| 03:22      | kind of only ever think about just writing the content                         |
| 03:26      | and doing things.                                                              |
| 03:27      | So I'm glad that you saw things like that                                      |
| 03:29      | and you started with the small stuff                                           |
| 03:31      | and it seems like you've learned and improved                                  |
| 03:33      | as you've gone along.                                                          |
| 03:35      | Oh yeah, for sure.                                                             |
| 03:36      | And if necessity is the mother of invention,                                   |
| 03:39      | I only had so much time that I could work                                      |
| 03:41      | and I was trying to work around my kid's schedules.                            |
| 03:44      | And I realised that the more I could automate,                                 |
| 03:46      | the more I could free up my time                                               |
| 03:48      | to be able to be there for them.                                               |
| 03:50      | And also eliminate room for a lot of errors.                                   |
| 03:53      | If I got interrupted, if something is automated,                               |
| 03:55      | there's less chance                                                            |
| 03:56      | that I'm gonna make a mistake in the process.                                  |
| 03:58      | Yeah, that's the thing people forget.                                          |
| 03:59      | I mean, it's faster,                                                           |
| 04:00      | but it's also more consistent when you build automations.                      |
| 04:04      | But you didn't just learn to use automation                                    |
| 04:07      | to help around the house.                                                      |
| 04:09      | You also kind of folded it into your business                                  |
| 04:11      | at kimcaloca.com                                                               |
| 04:13      | where you call yourself a systems                                              |
| 04:15      | and automation strategist.                                                     |
| 04:17      | Yep, yep, that's what I do.                                                    |
| 04:18      | So my clients, it first started out                                            |
| 04:21      | with giving me more time,                                                      |
| 04:23      | but then with my clients,                                                      |
| 04:24      | I realised that what I could do in their businesses                            |
| 04:27      | is help them to be more scalable.                                              |
| 04:29      | So when things were automated,                                                 |
| 04:32      | it made it, it gives them more room                                            |
| 04:35      | to be able to grow their business faster                                       |
| 04:37      | and in a more sustainable way                                                  |
| 04:38      | so that they can serve more clients                                            |
| 04:39      | without necessarily having to bring on a lot more team                         |
| 04:42      | or do a lot more manual labor                                                  |
| 04:44      | to get people into their membership programs                                   |
| 04:48      | or group coaching programs and things like that.                               |
| 04:51      | Yeah, and the internet is ripe with automation                                 |
| 04:54      | for that type of work now.                                                     |
| 04:56      | We cover internet automation often on the show                                 |
| 04:58      | and I feel like that's probably something                                      |
| 05:00      | you could talk about.                                                          |
| 05:01      | Maybe I'll have to have you back in the future                                 |
| 05:02      | today to talk about that.                                                      |
| 05:03      | But today, I would really like to kind of talk about                           |
| 05:08      | the automation you're doing around the house                                   |
| 05:11      | because I think all of us are looking for ways                                 |
| 05:13      | to improve that stuff.                                                         |
| 05:14      | Yeah, so it started with using [[Signals for HomeKit\|Signals]].                                        |
| 05:18      | So Rosemary, I credit this to you                                              |
| 05:20      | because you talked so much about this                                          |
| 05:21      | with using the [[Signals for HomeKit\|Signals]] for iPhone where you,                                   |
| 05:25      | that is the name of the app, right?                                            |
| 05:26      | Yes, yes.                                                                      |
| 05:27      | But doing the different coloured flashing light combinations.                  |
| 05:31      | So my 14 year old can go in his room                                           |
| 05:35      | and he likes to be in there playing on his [[Steam Deck]]                          |
| 05:39      | or on his [[Nintendo Switch\|Switch]] and hanging out with his friends                              |
| 05:41      | on [[FaceTime]] calls.                                                             |
| 05:43      | And it's got increasingly more difficult                                       |
| 05:46      | to get his attention to come out and do things                                 |
| 05:48      | like eat dinner or take out the trash.                                         |
| 05:51      | And so I started to have,                                                      |
| 05:54      | I put smart bulbs in his room and I set up automation                          |
| 05:58      | so like, you know, I could push a button                                       |
| 06:00      | and it would change his lights to a certain colour                             |
| 06:02      | like it would turn your, his lights green                                      |
| 06:04      | when it was time to come eat dinner.                                           |
| 06:06      | And then it would, you know, I would use [[PushCut]]                           |
| 06:08      | and five minutes later, send him a text that's like,                           |
| 06:10      | okay, I changed your lights five minutes ago,                                  |
| 06:12      | now it's time to come eat.                                                     |
| 06:14      | And then, you know, there was different ones                                   |
| 06:15      | where I would tell him, okay, like it's time for bed,                          |
| 06:18      | it's time to come do this chore.                                               |
| 06:20      | So I set up a lot of automations for that                                      |
| 06:22      | that were just kind of like flashing his lights                                |
| 06:24      | to get his attention.                                                          |
| 06:25      | And I bet, you know, teens probably like that                                  |
| 06:28      | more than you actually talking to them.                                        |
| 06:30      | They want to disambiguate the parents as much as possible                      |
| 06:34      | so I can see the advantage of that.                                            |
| 06:36      | Yeah, I think sometimes it helps.                                              |
| 06:39      | Also, it means you're not competing with the headphones                        |
| 06:41      | or whatever it is, you know, it's coming in                                    |
| 06:44      | in a way that's, you know, going to interrupt                                  |
| 06:46      | what he's doing without competing                                              |
| 06:48      | with what he's doing directly, which is really smart.                          |
| 06:50      | Right.                                                                         |
| 06:51      | Well, and that's part of why my automations                                    |
| 06:54      | have had to get more complicated is I've had to work harder                    |
| 06:56      | to get his attention through the headphones.                                   |
| 06:58      | All right, so let's break that one down a bit.                                 |
| 07:01      | What are the specific steps you're taking                                      |
| 07:03      | to make all that happen, the light flash                                       |
| 07:06      | and the five minute warning?                                                   |
| 07:09      | So with the light flash and the five minute warning,                           |
| 07:12      | there's a shortcut that I set up.                                              |
| 07:14      | So there's two different shortcuts that I set up.                              |
| 07:16      | And the first one flashes the lights                                           |
| 07:19      | or changes the light colour.                                                   |
| 07:21      | And it sends a signal off to [[PushCut]] that says,                            |
| 07:24      | okay, run this shortcut in five minutes.                                       |
| 07:27      | And so then it runs a second shortcut                                          |
| 07:30      | that sends him a text that's like, okay, now it's dinner time.                 |
| 07:33      | And I think it changes the lights                                              |
| 07:34      | to a different colour at that time.                                            |
| 07:36      | Or I can't remember, it's been set up for so long                              |
| 07:39      | that I can't remember exactly.                                                 |
| 07:40      | But yeah, so it's a shortcut that initially triggers it,                       |
| 07:43      | changes the lights and tells [[PushCut]], wait five minutes,                   |
| 07:46      | and then run this other shortcut.                                              |
| 07:49      | Yeah, that's pretty simple.                                                    |
| 07:50      | I like it.                                                                     |
| 07:51      | And it works, right?                                                           |
| 07:52      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 07:53      | The trick is to make sure he keeps the light turned on.                        |
| 07:56      | Right, well, the light turned on is fine.                                      |
| 07:58      | It's the [[HomePod#HomePod Mini]] that's in his room                           |
| 08:01      | that often mysteriously seems to get unplugged.                                |
| 08:04      | Oh.                                                                            |
| 08:06      | Yeah, because that one I can broadcast my voice                                |
| 08:09      | or I use the intercom feature and I have a list of prompts.                    |
| 08:12      | So I'll have a shortcut that I run                                             |
| 08:15      | that speaks into my child's room and says,                                     |
| 08:19      | it's time to come clean the cat boxes                                          |
| 08:21      | or it's time to come take out the trash.                                       |
| 08:23      | So I have a list of options.                                                   |
| 08:25      | When I run the shortcut, it says,                                              |
| 08:26      | which thing do you wanna intercom?                                             |
| 08:28      | Or it has a text input so I can type something in                              |
| 08:31      | and then run it that way.                                                      |
| 08:34      | You know, I think a lot of people have [[HomePod\|HomePods]]                   |
| 08:36      | but don't use the intercom feature.                                            |
| 08:39      | And it kind of snuck into the system several years ago.                        |
| 08:43      | I know I didn't use it for the first year or two                               |
| 08:45      | and then I kind of discovered it                                               |
| 08:47      | and I find it really useful.                                                   |
| 08:48      | I mean, I think it's kind of cool                                              |
| 08:50      | that you can talk into the rooms of the kids                                   |
| 08:53      | and it's not as intrusive again,                                               |
| 08:57      | but it is a way to get a message out                                           |
| 09:00      | and my wife and I even use them between each other.                            |
| 09:02      | Explain a little bit how you set that up                                       |
| 09:04      | and for people who have [[HomePod\|HomePods]]                                  |
| 09:06      | and aren't using it, how to get started.                                       |
| 09:09      | Yeah, so I have, so I'll start with setting up a shortcut                      |
| 09:12      | and in the shortcut, I'll add an action that is just,                          |
| 09:16      | you can only do it on your phone.                                              |
| 09:17      | Unfortunately, I really wish I could run the shortcut                          |
| 09:20      | from [[Shortcuts]] on my Mac,                                                  |
| 09:23      | but you have to do it from your phone and I have it.                           |
| 09:25      | So the first step is choose from menu                                          |
| 09:27      | and then I put in my options                                                   |
| 09:30      | and then I put in the text for each option.                                    |
| 09:33      | So I have a text box that says, come eat,                                      |
| 09:36      | come empty the dish rack and so on.                                            |
| 09:38      | And then the text one actually opens up a text prompt                          |
| 09:41      | so I can put in something else                                                 |
| 09:42      | that's not one of the usual things that I send in.                             |
| 09:47      | The other thing that I have in this automation as a backup                     |
| 09:51      | in case he has unplugged the [[HomePod]] or he's ignoring it,                  |
| 09:54      | is it also sends a text with whatever,                                         |
| 09:56      | so it sends him a text with whatever I have just put in                        |
| 09:59      | as the input and then it also intercoms that                                   |
| 10:03      | into the bedroom and changes their light.                                      |
| 10:07      | Teenagers, sometimes it takes a little extra work.                             |
| 10:09      | Oh yeah.                                                                       |
| 10:10      | Have you played at all with doing the intercom                                 |
| 10:13      | to people's devices?                                                           |
| 10:15      | Because this is something that,                                                |
| 10:17      | I mean, I don't have other people in my home with my [[HomePod]]               |
| 10:20      | so it's kind of difficult for me to experiment with this.                      |
| 10:22      | I can have a really great conversation with myself                             |
| 10:25      | if I really want to,                                                           |
| 10:26      | but it's kind of pointless to intercom myself.                                 |
| 10:29      | But I know that intercom does have a feature                                   |
| 10:32      | where you can have the intercom                                                |
| 10:34      | go to people's specific devices as well.                                       |
| 10:38      | Like to his phone and his MacBook?                                             |
| 10:40      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 10:41      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 10:42      | Oh wow.                                                                        |
| 10:43      | I believe it's only iPhones and Apple Watches                                  |
| 10:46      | that it will go to as well.                                                    |
| 10:49      | But yeah, there's the option,                                                  |
| 10:52      | I believe it is under in the Home app.                                         |
| 10:56      | If you go into the Home settings, I think it is.                               |
| 11:00      | And then under intercom,                                                       |
| 11:02      | yeah, I can see receive notifications when never,                              |
| 11:07      | when I'm at home or anywhere.                                                  |
| 11:08      | And I can turn it on enough for all the people                                 |
| 11:10      | because of course I'm an admin of my home.                                     |
| 11:12      | But yeah, that means that the intercom notifications                           |
| 11:16      | can go to people,                                                              |
| 11:17      | but I'm not entirely certain how well that interacts                           |
| 11:19      | with the [[Shortcuts]] intercom feature                                        |
| 11:21      | because that to me seemed very much like it was designed                       |
| 11:25      | for either going to like the whole home                                        |
| 11:28      | or just to like specific rooms or areas.                                       |
| 11:32      | And so I think you'd have to intercom it to everywhere                         |
| 11:35      | and then it would go to the people through [[Shortcuts]].                      |
| 11:38      | Oh, that's really interesting.                                                 |
| 11:39      | I'm gonna have to play with that.                                              |
| 11:40      | But I also actually think the text message                                     |
| 11:42      | might be the more elegant solution there in the sense though,                  |
| 11:46      | because it does target him.                                                    |
| 11:47      | And one thing young people are wired to                                        |
| 11:51      | is to check their messages.                                                    |
| 11:53      | So I think it gets through.                                                    |
| 11:57      | But you don't just have it turn green                                          |
| 11:59      | when it's time for dinner.                                                     |
| 12:00      | You've gone next level with this, right?                                       |
| 12:03      | Right, so I have it turn green when it's time for dinner.                      |
| 12:06      | I have other colours for different tasks.                                      |
| 12:09      | For my six year old,                                                           |
| 12:10      | one really fun one that I've done is,                                          |
| 12:12      | he likes to have this little dance party.                                      |
| 12:15      | So in my bedroom, I'll have the lights just go on in [[Signals for HomeKit\|Signals]].                  |
| 12:19      | I'll have it do the spectrum effect.                                           |
| 12:22      | And I'll have that repeat like 10 times.                                       |
| 12:26      | So, and he just loves that.                                                    |
| 12:28      | Like I push the button and it makes the lights go rainbow                      |
| 12:30      | and he just kind of goes crazy                                                 |
| 12:32      | having a little dance party in my room.                                        |
| 12:34      | So it's really fun to be able                                                  |
| 12:36      | to make that kind of magic for him.                                            |
| 12:38      | The other thing I use for him is right,                                        |
| 12:39      | if I'm coming in for bedtime from my desk,                                     |
| 12:42      | I'll have a, you know, I'm meticulously track my time.                         |
| 12:47      | So when I change my, my Timery tracking,                                       |
| 12:52      | it turns off my work timer,                                                    |
| 12:54      | turns on my kid's bedtime timer.                                               |
| 12:57      | And it asks me if it's time for snuggles or not                                |
| 13:00      | with my, cause my little one loves to do chair snuggles                        |
| 13:03      | and our recliner at night.                                                     |
| 13:04      | And so when I go in the house,                                                 |
| 13:06      | I'll have the [[HomePod]] intercom program                                     |
| 13:08      | to say it's time for chair snuggles.                                           |
| 13:11      | And to my little one who doesn't realise                                       |
| 13:14      | that's because I'm pushing a button to make it say that,                       |
| 13:17      | he's like, oh, Siri said it's time for chair snuggles.                         |
| 13:19      | Yeah, I love it.                                                               |
| 13:21      | So, yeah.                                                                      |
| 13:22      | Now push that button as often as you can                                       |
| 13:23      | before you know it, he'll be in college                                        |
| 13:25      | and just asking you for money.                                                 |
| 13:27      | Right.                                                                         |
| 13:29      | And then you have the one,                                                     |
| 13:30      | you also have another one,                                                     |
| 13:31      | the emergency break glass one,                                                 |
| 13:33      | tell us about that one.                                                        |
| 13:34      | Oh, right.                                                                     |
| 13:35      | So when the 14 year old is successfully                                        |
| 13:38      | and ignoring all of the signals that I'm sending to him,                       |
| 13:43      | there's one sort of mother of all shortcuts                                    |
| 13:46      | that I've made to be just intensely funny and annoying.                        |
| 13:53      | So I have it flash his lights in his room.                                     |
| 13:59      | Siri will go off on a repeat with the,                                         |
| 14:02      | have you ever heard the song that never ends?                                  |
| 14:03      | Like this is the song that never ends,                                         |
| 14:05      | this goes on and on my friends.                                                |
| 14:06      | So I have that loop on repeat a few different times.                           |
| 14:10      | Meanwhile, all of his lights are flashing                                      |
| 14:12      | and I think that's the gist of it,                                             |
| 14:16      | but that's really annoying enough                                              |
| 14:18      | where if I tell him, hey,                                                      |
| 14:20      | I'm gonna run the annoying timer                                               |
| 14:22      | if you keep ignoring this,                                                     |
| 14:24      | that usually is enough to stop him.                                            |
| 14:26      | And the couple of times that I've had to run it,                               |
| 14:28      | it's been, he's been very irritated,                                           |
| 14:32      | but also it's been funny.                                                      |
| 14:33      | So I don't try to overuse that one.                                            |
| 14:36      | Sure, sure.                                                                    |
| 14:37      | But I was just thinking like,                                                  |
| 14:39      | I used to have trouble getting my kids out of bed.                             |
| 14:41      | I could see like putting something together like that.                         |
| 14:43      | And then I'd put like a kill button like in the bathroom.                      |
| 14:48      | So it would just go off until they got out of bed                              |
| 14:50      | and went to the bathroom and they pushed the button.                           |
| 14:53      | That would be another nerdy way as a parent                                    |
| 14:56      | to get them out of bed.                                                        |
| 14:57      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 14:59      | As an adult who struggles with getting out of bed,                             |
| 15:01      | home automation is absolutely the best solution                                |
| 15:03      | for that for me.                                                               |
| 15:04      | Like my alarm goes off in the morning,                                         |
| 15:06      | the blind goes up, the blackout curtains open,                                 |
| 15:08      | the lights turn on.                                                            |
| 15:09      | Like it doesn't completely fix the problem,                                    |
| 15:12      | but it makes it a darn sight harder                                            |
| 15:14      | to just ignore the fact that it is time to get up                              |
| 15:17      | and do things because there is all of the lights suddenly.                     |
| 15:20      | So yeah, I don't yet have the button where it will,                            |
| 15:25      | it'll play sound until I go                                                    |
| 15:26      | and press the button in the bathroom                                           |
| 15:27      | because I'm frankly not quite sure how I would do that                         |
| 15:31      | because I know like for whatever speaker system,                               |
| 15:33      | like there are gonna be other ways around turning that off                     |
| 15:37      | for me because I know how to do it.                                            |
| 15:40      | I also know that a cat can indeed turn on music                                |
| 15:42      | on a [[HomePod]] with their tail if they try hard enough.                      |
| 15:45      | So there's ways around a lot of this stuff,                                    |
| 15:47      | but yeah, I think the emergency break glass automation                         |
| 15:50      | in particular, it's nice to have in your back pocket                           |
| 15:52      | if you ever need it and hopefully,                                             |
| 15:54      | hopefully you don't need it all that often.                                    |
| 15:57      | Right, we've got to get you that alarm clock                                   |
| 15:58      | that like jumps off the nightstand                                             |
| 16:00      | and goes under your bed until you get it.                                      |
| 16:02      | Yeah, if I had a bed that things could go under.                               |
| 16:07      | Yeah, I remember those kids toys                                               |
| 16:09      | where it was like a little fairy                                               |
| 16:10      | and you had like a part that you held in your hand                             |
| 16:12      | and then you pulled a cord                                                     |
| 16:13      | and it would like send the little doll flying up really high                   |
| 16:16      | with like a four petal plastic skirt or something,                             |
| 16:20      | something like that as an alarm clock.                                         |
| 16:22      | There's not really a good place in my bedroom                                  |
| 16:24      | because my room is very small,                                                 |
| 16:27      | my entire apartment is very small.                                             |
| 16:28      | I feel like, you know,                                                         |
| 16:30      | that sort of thing isn't gonna work super well where I am,                     |
| 16:33      | but yeah, I'd open either curtains                                             |
| 16:36      | and turning on all the lights                                                  |
| 16:37      | and things like that works pretty well as a basis for me.                      |
| 16:40      | Yeah, there's another one.                                                     |
| 16:41      | I think it's still on Amazon, I'll have to look for it.                        |
| 16:43      | It has a propeller on it.                                                      |
| 16:44      | And when the alarm goes off, it winds up the propeller                         |
| 16:47      | and it flies off into the room somewhere                                       |
| 16:49      | and the alarm won't turn off until you go find the propeller                   |
| 16:52      | and put it back on top of the alarm.                                           |
| 16:55      | So there's all sorts of ways to do that.                                       |
| 16:57      | I'll tell you, I've never really had a problem                                 |
| 17:00      | getting out of bed, but I do get to bed early enough.                          |
| 17:03      | That's the trick, right, get enough sleep.                                     |
| 17:05      | That's the ultimate automation tip is get enough sleep.                        |
| 17:09      | Well, I was just gonna say that getting my kid                                 |
| 17:10      | to get to bed and get enough sleep                                             |
| 17:12      | because, you know, as an adult, I want to go to bed sometimes,                 |
| 17:15      | but I can't go to bed until I get him to bed.                                  |
| 17:17      | So that's where some of these shortcuts have come in                           |
| 17:19      | is trying to cut off the fun so that he has to stop                            |
| 17:23      | and go to bed because it's just not worth it                                   |
| 17:24      | to try to stay up anymore.                                                     |
| 17:26      | Yeah, sure, and I mean, there's so much science behind that                    |
| 17:28      | with screens and stuff to kind of like disengage them.                         |
| 17:35      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by ExpressVPN.                    |
| 17:38      | In the real world, if you're looking for privacy,                              |
| 17:40      | you'd close the door, but online,                                              |
| 17:42      | we leave doors open everywhere we go.                                          |
| 17:44      | Using the internet without using ExpressVPN                                    |
| 17:46      | is like never closing doors behind you.                                        |
| 17:49      | Because all of your traffic flows through their servers,                       |
| 17:52      | internet service providers,                                                    |
| 17:53      | including mobile network providers,                                            |
| 17:54      | know every single website you visit.                                           |
| 17:57      | ExpressVPN reroutes 100% of your traffic                                       |
| 17:59      | through secure encrypted servers                                               |
| 18:01      | so your ISP can't see your browsing history.                                   |
| 18:03      | There are loads of reasons to choose ExpressVPN.                               |
| 18:06      | It hides your IP address,                                                      |
| 18:07      | which makes it extremely difficult                                             |
| 18:08      | for third parties to track your online activity.                               |
| 18:11      | Plus, it's easy to use.                                                        |
| 18:12      | Just fire up the app and click one button to get protected.                    |
| 18:15      | And it works on all devices,                                                   |
| 18:16      | phones, laptops, tablets, and more,                                            |
| 18:18      | so you can stay private on the go.                                             |
| 18:20      | And it's easy to see why it's rated number one                                 |
| 18:22      | via top tech reviewers like CNET and The Verge.                                |
| 18:25      | I've used ExpressVPN a number of times,                                        |
| 18:27      | and often it's a really great way                                              |
| 18:30      | to get around a limitation on a network                                        |
| 18:33      | that doesn't need to be there.                                                 |
| 18:34      | For example, not allowing me to visit a website                                |
| 18:37      | that they don't know the domain of.                                            |
| 18:39      | And it's also quite important to me to use ExpressVPN                          |
| 18:42      | so that I can actually access the content                                      |
| 18:44      | that I've been watching online.                                                |
| 18:46      | So if I'm traveling, then I can continue to watch things                       |
| 18:49      | that are available to me when I'm at home.                                     |

| 19:15      | Kim, you've got a series of shortcuts                                          |
| 19:18      | that you'd call "Bark" and,                                                      |
| 19:20      | well, screen time I understand, right?                                         |
| 19:22      | Screen time with kids is something                                             |
| 19:24      | that we should figure out as parents.                                          |
| 19:26      | But what is the "Bark" automation?                                               |
| 19:29      | Yeah, so [[Bark]] is this device that I got                                        |
| 19:32      | that my child absolutely loads,                                                |
| 19:35      | but it's plugged into my home network.                                         |
| 19:38      | So basically at the point of my router,                                        |
| 19:40      | this little device is plugged in                                               |
| 19:42      | and I assign devices in the house to different users                           |
| 19:46      | so that my child, his devices are,                                             |
| 19:51      | they're kind of monitored his internet activity                                |
| 19:54      | by this device.                                                                |
| 19:55      | It's a safety device kind of thing.                                            |
| 19:57      | It's like a blocker, a CDN blocker,                                            |
| 20:00      | so it doesn't, or what is it, the DNS blocker, right?                          |
| 20:05      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                    |
| 20:07      | And it has an app,                                                             |
| 20:08      | but they don't have any [[Shortcuts]] automation.                              |
| 20:10      | And if anyone working at [[Bark]] is listening to this                             |
| 20:14      | and wants to talk to me about some automation ideas,                           |
| 20:16      | some [[Shortcuts]] ideas, I'm happy to have a conversation.                    |
| 20:20      | But basically, because I couldn't automate anything                            |
| 20:23      | in the app, again, I had to invent ways                                        |
| 20:26      | to sort of build in some automation around it.                                 |
| 20:29      | And sometimes my kid would text me asking for time                             |
| 20:32      | and I would either add the time and forget to reply                            |
| 20:36      | or I would reply, but I would forget to add the time.                          |
| 20:39      | So what I've done is I made it so that I push a shortcut,                      |
| 20:43      | it texts and lets him know that I've received his request for time             |
| 20:46      | and that I'm adding the time                                                   |
| 20:48      | and then it opens the [[Bark]] app                                                 |
| 20:50      | so that I can then go in and add the time without forgetting.                  |
| 20:53      | And this is another one of those,                                              |
| 20:55      | this is like an ADHD thing as well,                                            |
| 20:57      | because I just get so distracted                                               |
| 20:59      | with all the things I have going on.                                           |
| 21:01      | That's really smart.                                                           |
| 21:01      | I really like that.                                                            |
| 21:03      | Yeah, and what I've also done with it is                                       |
| 21:05      | because it's the only way I can sometimes motivate him                         |
| 21:08      | to do the things that he needs to do around the house                          |
| 21:11      | is with that screen time as an incentive.                                      |
| 21:14      | So I have a list of,                                                           |
| 21:16      | like I have a [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] list that I keep                                       |
| 21:18      | that has his chores in it.                                                     |
| 21:20      | And when I open the shortcut, it picks,                                        |
| 21:22      | okay, what's the next thing that he needs to do?                               |
| 21:25      | So then it asks me, okay, pick one of the,                                     |
| 21:27      | pick the thing he needs to do next.                                            |
| 21:29      | And again, this is a shortcut                                                  |
| 21:30      | that triggers another shortcut with [[PushCut]].                               |
| 21:33      | So I select the item and it says, okay, I'm adding time now.                   |
| 21:38      | Please make sure that you do XYZ before you ask for more time.                 |
| 21:43      | And then it triggers a [[PushCut]] shortcut                                    |
| 21:45      | to after the time runs out,                                                    |
| 21:46      | because sometimes if I've told him                                             |
| 21:49      | there's something he needs to do after his time runs out,                      |
| 21:51      | he'll conveniently, once his time runs out,                                    |
| 21:54      | he'll just not ask for more time                                               |
| 21:56      | because he doesn't want to alert me to remind me                               |
| 22:00      | that it's time for him to do something.                                        |
| 22:02      | So it sends a text that says, okay, time's up.                                 |
| 22:04      | Remember, it's time to do XYZ.                                                 |
| 22:07      | And it pulls that from the shortcut.                                           |
| 22:09      | So it's like, there's a [[Data Jar]] variable                                      |
| 22:12      | that's storing what the thing is that I've asked him to do.                    |
| 22:15      | And then it calls back on that variable and says,                              |
| 22:18      | hey, remember, I added time an hour ago                                        |
| 22:21      | and now it's time to do this thing that I asked you to do.                     |
| 22:24      | Two observations.                                                              |
| 22:25      | The first is, it sounds like [[PushCut]] is really key                         |
| 22:28      | to your workflow for a lot of this thing.                                      |
| 22:30      | Oh yeah, big time.                                                             |
| 22:32      | And the second is, you know, when kids are sitting around                      |
| 22:35      | talking about how they defeat their parents' efforts                           |
| 22:38      | to keep them off the internet.                                                 |
| 22:40      | Your child, he has a tail of woe for his friends                               |
| 22:44      | because it seems like you've got it all locked in.                             |
| 22:47      | Good for you, good for you.                                                    |
| 22:49      | Why did you decide on the [[Bark]] device?                                         |
| 22:52      | I mean, you're pretty clever.                                                  |
| 22:53      | There's a lot of software DNS blocking services out there.                     |
| 22:57      | What landed you on this one?                                                   |
| 22:59      | Well, I did a lot of research                                                  |
| 23:01      | and I tried a few different apps before I went                                 |
| 23:05      | with the actual device.                                                        |
| 23:08      | The thing I liked about the [[Bark]] is that, A,                                   |
| 23:11      | it gives him a lot of privacy                                                  |
| 23:13      | because I really respect his right to privacy.                                 |
| 23:16      | But it also, it's a really safety-minded device.                               |
| 23:20      | So it will kind of read his text messages                                      |
| 23:24      | and it'll only, and the thing I get the most                                   |
| 23:28      | is Spotify notifications for some questionable lyrics                          |
| 23:31      | and things that he's listening to.                                             |
| 23:33      | But for the most part, the [[Bark]] is intended for safety.                        |
| 23:37      | So it flags the parents and says,                                              |
| 23:39      | hey, you might want to talk with your child                                    |
| 23:41      | because we noticed a text message that came through,                           |
| 23:45      | it's kind of geared towards grooming and things like that                      |
| 23:48      | that are just things that you really don't want your child                     |
| 23:50      | to become a victim of without even realising                                   |
| 23:53      | what's happening.                                                              |
| 23:54      | And so that was my thing because he's on YouTube a lot                         |
| 23:59      | and I can see value in what he's doing                                         |
| 24:03      | because he looks up things like how to speed run games                         |
| 24:09      | or how to create a glitch or how to,                                           |
| 24:11      | he also is learning how to code on scratch.                                    |
| 24:14      | So he looks up videos on how to code different things.                         |
| 24:17      | He wants to be a developer.                                                    |
| 24:20      | And I wanted a way to give him some freedom                                    |
| 24:22      | to be able to do that, but also to make sure                                   |
| 24:25      | that I knew that he was safe                                                   |
| 24:26      | and he wasn't going down any weird rabbit holes.                               |
| 24:28      | And I felt like the [[Bark]] was the option                                        |
| 24:30      | that gave me the most of that.                                                 |
| 24:32      | Well, it's an interesting device.                                              |
| 24:33      | I'd never heard of it before,                                                  |
| 24:34      | but this looks very attractive to me                                           |
| 24:38      | and I feel like any parents out there should check it out.                     |
| 24:42      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 24:43      | Yeah, I think the whole setup that you've got there                            |
| 24:47      | is very smart because I do a very similar thing to you                         |
| 24:51      | where you've got the shortcut,                                                 |
| 24:53      | which sends a message saying that you're adding the time                       |
| 24:56      | and then opens the [[Bark]] app.                                                   |
| 24:58      | Whenever I open [[Safari]] on my iPhone,                                           |
| 25:00      | it opens a new tab to [[DuckDuckGo]]                                               |
| 25:02      | because otherwise I'll tap on [[Safari]] to go and [[Google]]                          |
| 25:05      | the thing that I've just thought about or whatever.                            |
| 25:08      | And then I will get distracted                                                 |
| 25:10      | by whatever previous open tab was in there.                                    |
| 25:13      | And I found that just pushing myself into the app,                             |
| 25:17      | into the right app, helping the right thing                                    |
| 25:20      | into my face at the right time is incredibly useful for me.                    |
| 25:25      | And yeah, I think that that sort of thing, it's really smart.                  |
| 25:29      | I am gonna ask a question                                                      |
| 25:31      | and this is not a criticism, it's a curiosity.                                 |
| 25:34      | Have you ever had it where your child has checked off                          |
| 25:37      | the task that they were supposed to do in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]]                            |
| 25:40      | by the time that their time runs out on the internet?                          |
| 25:43      | And is that something that you've accounted for                                |
| 25:45      | with the shortcut that runs                                                    |
| 25:47      | whenever their internet time request runs out?                                 |
| 25:51      | No, I would love for that to happen.                                           |
| 25:54      | I have not been able to get him                                                |
| 25:55      | to have that level of initiative.                                              |
| 25:58      | I've tried setting a [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] list for him.                                   |
| 26:01      | I've got him in [[Asana]].                                                         |
| 26:03      | I created an [[Asana]] project for our home                                        |
| 26:05      | and I've got tasks for him in [[Asana]].                                           |
| 26:08      | I've got tasks for my husband in [[Asana]]                                         |
| 26:10      | and I can't get anybody else to use the stuff.                                 |
| 26:12      | So it's more like, check in with me, let me know it's done.                    |
| 26:15      | But that would be lovely if I could get him to check it off                    |
| 26:18      | and have it automatically give him screen time.                                |
| 26:21      | That's fair enough, yeah.                                                      |
| 26:22      | I was just wondering if this was ever a thing                                  |
| 26:24      | that had happened to you because I know                                        |
| 26:26      | that that happens to me sometimes.                                             |
| 26:27      | I'll set a reminder for myself to do something                                 |
| 26:30      | for like in an hour and then I'll get the reminder                             |
| 26:33      | and be like, well, I already did that                                          |
| 26:34      | and ignore the other six reminders                                             |
| 26:35      | of things that I haven't done.                                                 |
| 26:37      | So yeah.                                                                       |
| 26:38      | I mean, I know it's tough though                                               |
| 26:40      | when you're raising kids                                                       |
| 26:41      | because you do want to give them independence.                                 |
| 26:44      | I mean, when I was young,                                                      |
| 26:46      | we didn't have cell phones or pages or anything.                               |
| 26:48      | We went out on our bikes, nobody knew where we were                            |
| 26:51      | and we did our thing.                                                          |
| 26:52      | And I feel like that's part of growing up.                                     |
| 26:54      | So you definitely want to give them that freedom,                              |
| 26:56      | but we live in this world where there's all these risks                        |
| 26:59      | that especially with the internet                                              |
| 27:02      | that a lot of parents aren't aware of.                                         |
| 27:05      | So I think you're doing a good job.                                            |
| 27:08      | I mean, I don't know where the line is,                                        |
| 27:10      | but at least you're bringing intentionality.                                   |
| 27:13      | I have the same struggle with my kids.                                         |
| 27:14      | My kids are grown up, but we are all on fine friends.                          |
| 27:18      | And I'm very careful when I tell them,                                         |
| 27:20      | I never check where you are.                                                   |
| 27:22      | The purpose of fine friends                                                    |
| 27:23      | is if nobody knows where you are and there's a problem.                        |
| 27:27      | It's not for me to keep track of you                                           |
| 27:29      | when you go on a date or whatever.                                             |
| 27:31      | I'm just, but it's hard to find that middle ground.                            |
| 27:35      | And I do appreciate the effort you're making on this.                          |
| 27:39      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 27:39      | I know as a kid that I would just watch TV a lot.                              |
| 27:42      | I didn't have access to the kinds of things that he has.                       |
| 27:45      | But then again, he doesn't have the option of watching TV                      |
| 27:47      | because we don't have cable and channels                                       |
| 27:49      | and things that are entertaining for him.                                      |
| 27:51      | So it's really in a wild west kind of new frontier                             |
| 27:55      | with figuring out these things.                                                |
| 27:58      | Yeah, it definitely is.                                                        |
| 27:59      | But at the same time, it sounds like                                           |
| 28:01      | he's been a good inspiration for you for automation.                           |
| 28:03      | And also, if he's learning to code for himself,                                |
| 28:05      | then I'm sure he'll be automating his requests                                 |
| 28:08      | to I get more internet time at some point in the future.                       |
| 28:10      | I'm sure.                                                                      |
| 28:11      | Hopefully he just remembers to add the reminders                               |
| 28:14      | of the thing that he's supposed to do                                          |
| 28:15      | before he asks for more time.                                                  |
| 28:16      | Yeah, I could foresee a cat and mouse game                                     |
| 28:19      | going on in the Caloca-Madden house                                            |
| 28:23      | as he gets better at coding                                                    |
| 28:24      | and figuring out ways around your systems.                                     |
| 28:27      | And you find out ways around his systems.                                      |
| 28:30      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 28:32      | Oh man, when I got the [[Bark]],                                                   |
| 28:33      | he was not happy with that at first.                                           |
| 28:37      | I had to get a box to go around it                                             |
| 28:39      | to keep him from unplugging it.                                                |
| 28:40      | I had to get one of those clear plastic log boxes.                             |
| 28:42      | So that was a struggle.                                                        |
| 28:44      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 28:45      | But he's gotten used to it.                                                    |
| 28:46      | And we've got a good rhythm.                                                   |
| 28:47      | And he knows he can trust me.                                                  |
| 28:48      | He knows I'm not unreasonable                                                  |
| 28:49      | that if he asks for time and it makes sense                                    |
| 28:52      | to give him time as long as things are done                                    |
| 28:54      | and he's healthy about it, then it's fine.                                     |
| 28:57      | Well, I ran DNS blocking throughout my children's,                             |
| 29:01      | I mean, the whole run.                                                         |
| 29:03      | And we had the house,                                                          |
| 29:05      | we always wanted our house to be the one                                       |
| 29:06      | that all the kids came to.                                                     |
| 29:07      | So we'd always have chips and drinks                                           |
| 29:10      | and things that they would want, you know?                                     |
| 29:12      | And the, but they all knew that at the Sparks house,                           |
| 29:16      | you weren't gonna get very far on the internet                                 |
| 29:18      | because I had a pretty hard lockdown on where you could go.                    |
| 29:23      | And, you know, it was easy for me                                              |
| 29:26      | because I don't go to those sites.                                             |
| 29:28      | So it's really easy.                                                           |
| 29:29      | I just locked it down for the whole house                                      |
| 29:30      | and then there was not a problem.                                              |
| 29:32      | Well, this is one of those things where [[Bark]] really helps                      |
| 29:34      | because even though I probably could figure out                                |
| 29:36      | how to do that stuff, I'm pretty savvy,                                        |
| 29:38      | but I'm not super great at that coding                                         |
| 29:43      | and kind of back-end shirk would you stuff.                                    |
| 29:45      | So the [[Bark]] just makes it like it's a no-brainer.                              |
| 29:49      | It's an automation in itself, isn't it?                                        |
| 29:50      | Knowing when to not invest the time                                            |
| 29:52      | in doing something yourself                                                    |
| 29:53      | and just farm it out to another service or another device.                     |
| 29:56      | Oh yeah. Yeah.                                                                 |
| 29:57      | And also with your shortcut, you know,                                         |
| 30:00      | you can't solve the whole problem                                              |
| 30:02      | with automating stuff in the [[Bark]] app.                                         |
| 30:03      | But, you know, you're giving yourself the kickoff.                             |
| 30:06      | And I feel like that's a lesson                                                |
| 30:07      | that people should really learn.                                               |
| 30:09      | You know, you don't necessarily have to automate                               |
| 30:11      | the whole thing, just automate as much as you can of it                        |
| 30:14      | and then, you know, or as many chunks as you can.                              |
| 30:18      | And if you have to stitch the rest together                                    |
| 30:20      | by hand for the meantime, then that's okay.                                    |
| 30:22      | It's still an automation.                                                      |
| 30:23      | And if it's making your life easier, it's worth it.                            |
| 30:26      | Yep.                                                                           |
| 30:27      | You've got any automations you're working on right now                         |
| 30:30      | or things you're thinking about for the future                                 |
| 30:32      | that you haven't built yet?                                                    |
| 30:34      | So yeah, we have lots of smart plugs                                           |
| 30:37      | and smart light bulbs.                                                         |
| 30:40      | I don't have, even though we're homeowners,                                    |
| 30:42      | my house is older, so we don't have central air conditioning                   |
| 30:46      | and we haven't installed a lot of,                                             |
| 30:48      | like we haven't actually installed any smart switches                          |
| 30:50      | or anything, although I did just order some                                    |
| 30:52      | on a prime day deal.                                                           |
| 30:55      | But we did smart plugs and plugged in the Christmas lights                     |
| 30:59      | to them so that we could put them basically just on a timer                    |
| 31:03      | in the home app on an automation.                                              |
| 31:04      | But my six-year-old, what I noticed is we weren't using it                     |
| 31:08      | because he likes to turn on the Christmas light.                               |
| 31:10      | So we would have him turn it on                                                |
| 31:12      | instead of just being it on the automation.                                    |
| 31:16      | And so I was thinking that for next year,                                      |
| 31:18      | we could have it say, and I borrow this from you,                              |
| 31:20      | hey, Apple lady, Merry Christmas.                                              |
| 31:23      | And that way the [[HomePod]] can turn on the Christmas tree                    |
| 31:25      | or the outside lights or anything like that.                                   |
| 31:27      | So that's one idea I have for a little bit of magic                            |
| 31:31      | for this holiday season.                                                       |
| 31:33      | Yeah, and that's a fairly simple one.                                          |
| 31:36      | Yeah, and then if for some reason,                                             |
| 31:38      | you're not at home or something                                                |
| 31:40      | and therefore the lights aren't on,                                            |
| 31:41      | then you can have an automation turn them on                                   |
| 31:43      | by using the condition of nobody's at home                                     |
| 31:46      | or something like that.                                                        |
| 31:47      | So that you still get the lights when you arrive home                          |
| 31:50      | and then they can turn off maybe like five minutes                             |
| 31:53      | after you arrive home or something                                             |
| 31:55      | and then your six-year-old gets the joy of turning them on.                    |
| 31:59      | So yeah, I like that solution, that's nice.                                    |
| 32:04      | Yeah, and right now being in the joys of summer,                               |
| 32:07      | I'm figuring out my air conditioning automation.                               |
| 32:10      | So this is one I just put on my Instagram                                      |
| 32:12      | that just because you don't have central air conditioning                      |
| 32:16      | doesn't mean that you can't sort of have your house                            |
| 32:19      | kind of run on a thermostat situation.                                         |
| 32:21      | So I have my air conditioning units,                                           |
| 32:24      | my wall units plugged into smart plugs.                                        |
| 32:27      | So basically I just turned the air conditioner on                              |
| 32:29      | to whatever degree I want the setting                                          |
| 32:32      | to be on the thermostat on the air conditioner,                                |
| 32:34      | leave it turned on and plugged into a smart plug                               |
| 32:37      | and then control the on and off of the air conditioner                         |
| 32:40      | with the smart plug.                                                           |
| 32:41      | So I have conditions on those to come on                                       |
| 32:43      | at certain times of day or turn off at certain times of day.                   |
| 32:46      | And now I'm experimenting with, okay,                                          |
| 32:48      | what temperature does it need to be,                                           |
| 32:50      | what temperature does the [[HomePod]] sensor need to hit                       |
| 32:53      | in order for this window unit to need to come on?                              |
| 32:55      | The one that I really don't like to use                                        |
| 32:56      | because it's so loud but it's better                                           |
| 32:59      | than having the house get too warm.                                            |
| 33:01      | So that's what I'm kind of working on                                          |
| 33:03      | is setting up the automation so that I'm hopefully                             |
| 33:05      | not running all kind of five or six air conditioning units                     |
| 33:09      | I have here at the same time,                                                  |
| 33:11      | but toggling them on and off to get the house                                  |
| 33:13      | to like the right temperature at the right time.                               |
| 33:17      | Yeah, so you've just got, I'm guessing                                         |
| 33:19      | the dumbest air conditioning units you can get                                 |
| 33:22      | where there's like a physical switch to turn them on                           |
| 33:24      | and that same physical switch just stays                                       |
| 33:26      | on when they get turned off.                                                   |
| 33:27      | Yep.                                                                           |
| 33:28      | And is that how you're doing that?                                             |
| 33:30      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 33:30      | Okay, that's smart.                                                            |
| 33:32      | I always think that the best thing to do                                       |
| 33:34      | with some devices is just,                                                     |
| 33:37      | either you have to invest the money                                            |
| 33:39      | to go on the really smart ones                                                 |
| 33:41      | or you need to buy the cheapest one                                            |
| 33:44      | and use your smarts to automate it.                                            |
| 33:46      | Because yeah, automating hardware                                              |
| 33:50      | in particular for smart home stuff can be,                                     |
| 33:53      | it's a tricky balance of finding the right thing                               |
| 33:56      | that solves the problem in a way                                               |
| 33:58      | that doesn't end up annoying you in some way                                   |
| 34:01      | or causing some kind of limitation                                             |
| 34:03      | which isn't pleasant to live with.                                             |
| 34:05      | So yeah, I approve.                                                            |
| 34:06      | I did something similar with my dehumidifier                                   |
| 34:09      | before I finally found a smart one                                             |
| 34:10      | that I was willing to work with                                                |
| 34:12      | to get it into my home automation system.                                      |
| 34:14      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                 |
| 34:17      | So Kim, one of the things I noticed you popped into                            |
| 34:20      | with the show notes for us is a little topic                                   |
| 34:23      | called automation bridges.                                                     |
| 34:25      | And I love this idea because it's sometimes                                    |
| 34:30      | difficult to figure out how to get from A to B                                 |
| 34:33      | just in general.                                                               |
| 34:34      | And then when you add the automation layer                                     |
| 34:35      | on top of it, that's kind of tricky.                                           |
| 34:37      | So how are you bridging some of these things together?                         |
| 34:39      | Yeah, so this idea kind of comes                                               |
| 34:41      | that similar to that automation I did with the [[Bark]]                            |
| 34:44      | where I realised I couldn't automate the [[Bark]] itself                           |
| 34:47      | but I could automate a piece of it                                             |
| 34:49      | and sort of bridge the gap.                                                    |
| 34:51      | Like I said, there's a lot of things that I can do                             |
| 34:54      | in let's say, for example, [[Zapier]] versus [[Make]]                          |
| 34:58      | or formerly known as [[Make\|Integromat]].                                               |
| 35:00      | So there's some things I can do in [[Zapier]]                                  |
| 35:02      | that I can't do and [[Make]]                                                   |
| 35:03      | and there's some things I can do and [[Make]]                                  |
| 35:04      | that I can't do in [[Zapier]].                                                 |
| 35:06      | So what I'll do is I will send a [[Webhook\|webhook]] trigger in [[Zapier]].   |
| 35:11      | So I'll trigger the action, the automation off in [[Zapier]]                   |
| 35:14      | and then I will have that do the couple of things                              |
| 35:17      | that I needed to do in [[Zapier]]                                              |
| 35:18      | and then pass the automation, the rest of the task                             |
| 35:21      | over to [[Make]] to finish off the automation.                                 |
| 35:25      | Another thing is I have a,                                                     |
| 35:28      | so I do have a [[Stream Deck]] on my desk                                      |
| 35:30      | and I cannot for the life of me get this tedious task                          |
| 35:34      | I have to do for my client of Facebook ads reporting.                          |
| 35:37      | So I'll go into the ads manager,                                               |
| 35:39      | I'll grab all of the numbers that I need                                       |
| 35:41      | to sort of click, highlight each of them and copy them.                        |
| 35:44      | And then I go over to my spreadsheet                                           |
| 35:45      | where I have to enter them                                                     |
| 35:47      | and I press a button on my [[Stream Deck]]                                     |
| 35:49      | that will paste them all into the spreadsheet.                                 |
| 35:52      | So it just automatically boom, boom, boom,                                     |
| 35:54      | copies tabs over and paste all of the numbers over.                            |
| 35:58      | And I swear that little shortcut is so handy for me.                           |
| 36:01      | I actually took my [[Stream Deck]] on vacation                                 |
| 36:04      | because I was like, okay, I still have to do this ads reporting                |
| 36:06      | while we're out of town.                                                       |
| 36:07      | And I'm taking my [[Stream Deck]] to plug into my laptop                       |
| 36:10      | because I cannot stand to do this task                                         |
| 36:11      | without being able to push a button                                            |
| 36:13      | and paste in those four numbers.                                               |
| 36:16      | However many times I have to do it.                                            |
| 36:17      | Hey, you know, it's funny                                                      |
| 36:18      | because you can always put that stuff on keyboard shortcuts                    |
| 36:21      | but there's something about those [[Stream Deck]] buttons                      |
| 36:24      | that is very attractive for automation.                                        |
| 36:27      | Oh yeah, I used to do it with a [[Keyboard Maestro]] shortcut.                 |
| 36:30      | Like I would just type in the shortcut                                         |
| 36:31      | but the pushing the button is just,                                            |
| 36:33      | it feels like, yep, there, it's doing it for me.                               |
| 36:36      | I'm not typing in something to make it happen.                                 |
| 36:39      | Can I wind back though about [[Zapier]] and [[Make]]                           |
| 36:42      | because I feel like a lot of people are curious                                |
| 36:45      | about this stuff but they get hung up                                          |
| 36:47      | and I know that you use it a lot                                               |
| 36:49      | kind of for your day job work.                                                 |
| 36:52      | What are some examples of the automations                                      |
| 36:55      | you're running through [[Zapier]] and [[Make]]?                                |
| 36:58      | So one example, I have,                                                        |
| 37:01      | one of the clients I was talking about earlier                                 |
| 37:03      | with scaling her business,                                                     |
| 37:04      | she runs a small group coaching program                                        |
| 37:07      | and it used to be her just teaching the classes.                               |
| 37:10      | So there was one coach, you know,                                              |
| 37:12      | three different times on one day                                               |
| 37:15      | and people would sign up for one of those times.                               |
| 37:17      | Well, as she's grown her business,                                             |
| 37:20      | she has hired a team of coaches.                                               |
| 37:22      | And so now there are four coaches                                              |
| 37:25      | and people can pick, you know,                                                 |
| 37:27      | Leanne on Tuesday or Diana on Wednesday                                        |
| 37:31      | and there's Wednesday at noon                                                  |
| 37:33      | and there's Wednesday at 7.30.                                                 |
| 37:35      | And getting people to be able to choose a day and time                         |
| 37:40      | of a class and sign up for it                                                  |
| 37:42      | and get the correct information                                                |
| 37:44      | and it turned out to be a bit of a beast.                                      |
| 37:47      | So I would program those into [[Airtable]]                                         |
| 37:52      | with the different classes                                                     |
| 37:53      | that are led by the different coaches.                                         |
| 37:55      | And then when they purchase that product,                                      |
| 37:58      | so if they go and they sign up for the class                                   |
| 38:00      | that's Leanne on Tuesday at 12,                                                |
| 38:03      | they get popped into a [[WebHook\|webhook]]                                    |
| 38:06      | that searches an [[Airtable]] list that I have                                     |
| 38:10      | and that list has everything they need.                                        |
| 38:12      | So it has their Zoom link,                                                     |
| 38:13      | it has the day and time of their class,                                        |
| 38:16      | it has all of the dates of their sessions.                                     |
| 38:18      | And so that then automates the client                                          |
| 38:23      | receiving all of that information in an email                                  |
| 38:25      | and in their membership area displays also.                                    |
| 38:28      | So like when they log into their members area,                                 |
| 38:30      | it shows their coach, their day, their time.                                   |
| 38:33      | And it shows that individually for each of the clients                         |
| 38:37      | who signs up for the group coaching program.                                   |
| 38:39      | And there's about 180 to 250 people                                            |
| 38:43      | who sign up for each of these.                                                 |
| 38:44      | So there's 10 to 15 classes that I'm managing that way.                        |
| 38:49      | And [[Airtable]] and [[Zapier]] are doing a lot of lifting                         |
| 38:51      | that we used to have to do manually                                            |
| 38:53      | with plugging that information in.                                             |
| 38:55      | Yeah, I can just imagine                                                       |
| 38:56      | if somebody got the wrong Zoom link for something like that,                   |
| 38:59      | it would be a very understandable human error                                  |
| 39:01      | on the part of the people sending that link                                    |
| 39:03      | that there's six different, 10 different Zoom links.                           |
| 39:06      | Of course, sometimes somebody would get the wrong one,                         |
| 39:08      | but by using the automation, that's not a problem.                             |
| 39:11      | I'm guessing it has also possibly cut down                                     |
| 39:13      | on the number of emails going,                                                 |
| 39:15      | hey, I don't have the information yet                                          |
| 39:18      | that people would be expecting to receive                                      |
| 39:19      | probably very quickly.                                                         |
| 39:21      | As soon as they've gone signed up for everything,                              |
| 39:24      | because usually when you sign up for things,                                   |
| 39:26      | it's automated, there's an immediate response that says,                       |
| 39:29      | hey, thanks for your email                                                     |
| 39:31      | or thanks for your request, we'll do something.                                |
| 39:32      | So you've handed all that off to the systems,                                  |
| 39:36      | which sounds pretty cool.                                                      |
| 39:37      | And I'm glad to hear that there's somebody else                                |
| 39:39      | using [[Airtable]] because I do love that app so much.                             |
| 39:42      | Oh, I love it.                                                                 |
| 39:43      | Yeah, and it's kind of been a multiple pass thing.                             |
| 39:46      | At first, I used [[Airtable]] to just create the Zoom links                        |
| 39:50      | and then I used [[Airtable]] to determine                                          |
| 39:52      | the dates of the sessions.                                                     |
| 39:53      | Like, okay, if the first session is on this day,                               |
| 39:55      | what are the next sessions?                                                    |
| 39:56      | And then it's just as every time we run it,                                    |
| 40:00      | there's another pass at it where I'm like,                                     |
| 40:01      | okay, what can I automate about it this time                                   |
| 40:03      | that makes life easier and makes the client experience,                        |
| 40:06      | which is the more important thing truly, the user experience                   |
| 40:10      | more seamless and more enjoyable.                                              |
| 40:13      | Yeah, yeah, automation evolution is definitely something                       |
| 40:17      | that is, I think the best approach                                             |
| 40:20      | because it's so tempting to try and just come up                               |
| 40:22      | with the perfect all-in-one solution from the beginning.                       |
| 40:25      | But by starting with, I'll just do this bit                                    |
| 40:28      | and then you add a bit more and bit more                                       |
| 40:30      | as your automation evolves and as you evolve as an automator,                  |
| 40:35      | I feel like you end up finding better solutions for things                     |
| 40:38      | as time goes on instead of if you just sat down                                |
| 40:41      | and tried really hard to figure out,                                           |
| 40:43      | from start to finish, right at the beginning,                                  |
| 40:45      | what would it look like and how should it work?                                |
| 40:47      | I feel like you can come up with better solutions                              |
| 40:49      | that are easier as well by doing that.                                         |
| 40:53      | So I'm very glad to hear that you've been                                      |
| 40:56      | taking multiple passes at things.                                              |
| 40:57      | Yeah, it's definitely the elephant one by to the time.                         |
| 41:01      | And that also gives me time to learn how to manage it                          |
| 41:03      | if something goes wrong.                                                       |
| 41:04      | Because if I try to automate too much at once                                  |
| 41:07      | and then something goes wrong                                                  |
| 41:08      | and it's ricocheting throughout the automation,                                |
| 41:11      | that's really terrifying and stressful.                                        |
| 41:14      | But if I just automate a small piece,                                          |
| 41:16      | make sure that works well,                                                     |
| 41:17      | then I can move on to something else.                                          |
| 41:19      | And that really works with this idea of bridging automation                    |
| 41:21      | that you were talking about                                                    |
| 41:22      | because by bridging automation,                                                |
| 41:24      | you're building small pieces of it.                                            |
| 41:26      | And then maybe you come back in a few months and say,                          |
| 41:28      | okay, well, I've got this piece of it mastered.                                |
| 41:31      | Now can I master the generation of the spreadsheet                             |
| 41:35      | or the booking of the meeting?                                                 |
| 41:38      | Or you can add pieces to it                                                    |
| 41:41      | and you've already got the one piece locked down                               |
| 41:43      | and the bridge just gets longer, right?                                        |
| 41:45      | And before you know it, you've automated the whole process.                    |
| 41:48      | Yeah, it's like automating Legos.                                              |
| 41:50      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 41:51      | Well, I like to say,                                                           |
| 41:53      | I like to use the Lego analogy with automation                                 |
| 41:55      | because it's just so visual, but it's true.                                    |
| 42:00      | And also by chunking things, if something goes wrong,                          |
| 42:02      | it's very likely to only be a chunk that goes wrong.                           |
| 42:05      | So there'll only be a chunk that needs to be done manually                     |
| 42:08      | or fixed before the next chunk can then pick it up                             |
| 42:11      | and do things.                                                                 |
| 42:12      | It's sometimes a little difficult to get things set up                         |
| 42:14      | so that they can take input from here or from there.                           |
| 42:18      | But usually there's a way around it.                                           |
| 42:20      | And what are the things I really like with [[Make]]?                           |
| 42:22      | Is if one of the scenarios,                                                    |
| 42:25      | that's what an automation solution in [[Make]] is called,                      |
| 42:28      | a scenario, if it goes wrong and it turns off [[Webhook\|webhooks]]            |
| 42:31      | in particular, it will cue the backlog.                                        |
| 42:35      | And so then you can look at it and see why it's gone wrong                     |
| 42:38      | and tweak it and fix it.                                                       |
| 42:40      | And then rerun it, including all the backlog.                                  |
| 42:43      | So it's not just dropped everything on the floor                               |
| 42:46      | and gone, I don't know what to do with that.                                   |
| 42:48      | Good luck.                                                                     |
| 42:49      | You're not completely stuck,                                                   |
| 42:51      | which I think is a really nice benefit,                                        |
| 42:53      | especially when you're just getting things figured out.                        |
| 42:55      | Yeah, I'm just starting to get a little bit more into [[Make]].                |
| 42:59      | I've just started in the past few months running                               |
| 43:01      | more automations through [[Make]].                                             |
| 43:03      | And I do like that.                                                            |
| 43:04      | I'm trying to get the hang of that piece in particular.                        |
| 43:08      | Yes.                                                                           |
| 43:09      | Yeah, I like the visual aspect of it in particular.                            |
| 43:12      | I don't know if that works well for you.                                       |
| 43:14      | I find that the fact that it's just very pretty in some ways                   |
| 43:18      | with all the circles, the bridges,                                             |
| 43:21      | literally tying things together,                                               |
| 43:24      | it works very well for me.                                                     |
| 43:26      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 43:27      | Are any of you using [[IFTTT\|If This Then That]] at this point?                         |
| 43:30      | I started out using [[IFTTT\|If This Then That]],                                        |
| 43:33      | and I don't think anything is currently actively running on mine.              |
| 43:38      | I do have some recipes set up,                                                 |
| 43:40      | and they might just be feeding into something so old                           |
| 43:42      | I haven't even looked at it in a while.                                        |
| 43:45      | Yeah, the one that keeps me in that,                                           |
| 43:47      | because I'm using all three of them,                                           |
| 43:49      | because I can't handle myself,                                                 |
| 43:51      | but they've got the [[Day One]] trigger,                                           |
| 43:54      | and [[IFTTT\|If This Then That]], and I like [[Day One]],                                    |
| 43:56      | and there's so much you can feed it through their service.                     |
| 44:00      | I wish that some of these other competing surfaces                             |
| 44:03      | would also get a [[Day One]] action.                                               |
| 44:06      | Oh, you know what?                                                             |
| 44:07      | Come to think of it,                                                           |
| 44:08      | that is one that I'm using is actually a [[Day One]],                              |
| 44:10      | because I have an [[IFTTT\|If This Then That]] recipe                                    |
| 44:13      | that pulls my rescue time,                                                     |
| 44:16      | so it tracks how much time I spent on my phone                                 |
| 44:19      | on my computer and my sleep from my auto sleep app,                            |
| 44:24      | and it puts those into a [[Day One]] journal entry.                                |
| 44:27      | So I have like a [[Day One]] journal                                               |
| 44:29      | that just has how much time I spent on my computer                             |
| 44:31      | and how much time I spent sleeping,                                            |
| 44:33      | which are kind of my two primary metrics in life right now.                    |
| 44:36      | Fair enough.                                                                   |
| 44:37      | I have [[IFTTT\|If This Then That]] accounts,                                            |
| 44:39      | so I just checked,                                                             |
| 44:40      | and my applets are currently disabled,                                         |
| 44:43      | because I can do everything that I was doing,                                  |
| 44:47      | and I have less than that in [[Make]] and [[Zapier]],                          |
| 44:50      | and one thing about [[Make]] in particular                                     |
| 44:53      | is it's very easy for, well, very easy.                                        |
| 44:56      | Developers can create their own integrations.                                  |
| 44:59      | It's not up to [[Make]] to do the whole thing.                                 |
| 45:02      | You know, the developer can provide them with the data,                        |
| 45:04      | because that's what we did for [[PushCut]],                                    |
| 45:07      | and that's how we update things                                                |
| 45:09      | to make sure that all the things,                                              |
| 45:11      | all of the new options stay available.                                         |
| 45:13      | So [[Day One]] probably could integrate                                            |
| 45:16      | with [[Make]] and [[Zapier]] if they wanted to.                                |
| 45:19      | I'm guessing they just don't have the resources                                |
| 45:21      | within their team to be able to do that at the moment,                         |
| 45:23      | because it'll be another thing to maintain                                     |
| 45:25      | on top of the app itself, which is already pretty awesome.                     |
| 45:29      | I get the impression, Rose,                                                    |
| 45:30      | that you primarily use [[Make]] at this point, right?                          |
| 45:34      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                    |
| 45:35      | I just ended up, it's one of those things.                                     |
| 45:38      | I don't mind using all of the automation solutions,                            |
| 45:41      | but the problem with using all of the automation solutions                     |
| 45:44      | is then you have to remember where this thing is happening,                    |
| 45:47      | if something is, for some reason, not happening                                |
| 45:50      | or not quite working the same way.                                             |
| 45:52      | And as much as I do my best to document my things for myself of,               |
| 45:56      | hey, I've got these automations running here                                   |
| 45:58      | and those automations running there,                                           |
| 46:00      | at some point, inevitably, I will change something                             |
| 46:03      | and forget to update my documentation,                                         |
| 46:05      | and then I'll be going and I'll be looking at [[Zapier]] going,                |
| 46:07      | well, I can't see why this is going wrong.                                     |
| 46:09      | Everything seems fine.                                                         |
| 46:11      | And it turns out that it's in [[Make]] or vice versa.                          |
| 46:13      | So I have done my best to consolidate as many things                           |
| 46:16      | into [[Make]] as I can,                                                        |
| 46:19      | just because that ends up working nicely for me,                               |
| 46:23      | and in particular, in [[Make]],                                                |
| 46:25      | I do really like the branching                                                 |
| 46:28      | and the fact that you can filter data on your flow as well.                    |
| 46:36      | So, for example, whenever I get feedback for iOS today,                        |
| 46:41      | sometimes people will send in pet pictures for the pet tax,                    |
| 46:45      | which is a non-obligatory tax                                                  |
| 46:48      | where people are sending in a question for *[[Shortcuts]] corner*              |
| 46:51      | or show feedback, then they can send it a pet picture as well                  |
| 46:53      | and we show it on the show.                                                    |
| 46:55      | But if they do that, then I need to upload that image to [[Dropbox]]               |
| 46:58      | so that I can get a public link                                                |
| 47:00      | so that I can put that in the show notes for the studio                        |
| 47:02      | to then show during the show.                                                  |
| 47:05      | And so I have a filter on that particular automation                           |
| 47:09      | so that I can get all the details, all the feedback                            |
| 47:12      | that we receive and put it into [[Airtable]] for me                                |
| 47:14      | that says, hey, if this has attachments,                                       |
| 47:17      | then go through the attachments, the image attachments,                        |
| 47:20      | specifically upload these to a specific [[Dropbox]] folder                         |
| 47:23      | for this email and create links for them                                       |
| 47:26      | and put the links back into [[Airtable]] for me.                                   |
| 47:28      | And then when I go to look at that feedback,                                   |
| 47:31      | I can see all the [[Dropbox]] links                                                |
| 47:33      | and I can just click one thing and copy everything                             |
| 47:36      | straight into the Google Sheet for the show.                                   |
| 47:39      | And that makes my life a lot easier,                                           |
| 47:41      | the fact that I can just filter and say, hey,                                  |
| 47:43      | so keep going from here,                                                       |
| 47:45      | but only if you've got attachments that are images.                            |
| 47:47      | And that makes my life a lot easier                                            |
| 47:49      | for all the sorts of things that I'm doing that with.                          |
| 47:52      | Yeah, well, I do think one of the challenges                                   |
| 47:54      | for people getting started with online automation                              |
| 47:56      | is, you know, just choosing a service                                          |
| 47:59      | and which one do you start with?                                               |
| 48:01      | And like, you know, as you get deeper into it,                                 |
| 48:04      | you may use multiple services,                                                 |
| 48:06      | but most people just want to master one to begin with.                         |
| 48:09      | And that's what I was asking,                                                  |
| 48:11      | because I feel like [[Make]] is probably the starting point                    |
| 48:15      | at this point.                                                                 |
| 48:16      | But I don't know if this and that is really easy                               |
| 48:19      | and very visual.                                                               |
| 48:21      | They've got more complex over the years.                                       |
| 48:23      | I mean, they've all kind of, you know,                                         |
| 48:25      | they've all kind of coalesced around the same principles                       |
| 48:28      | and they're all building the same tools.                                       |
| 48:30      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 48:31      | Well, [[Zapier]] has a branching and paths and filters.                        |
| 48:36      | And, you know, for me, [[Zapier]] was so much easier to learn.                 |
| 48:40      | When I was first getting started,                                              |
| 48:41      | I did, I had an [[Make\|Integromat]] account                                             |
| 48:43      | and I could not for the life of me figure that out.                            |
| 48:46      | And it has been a real learning curve for me                                   |
| 48:48      | to figure out how to get in there and do stuff.                                |
| 48:50      | I feel like it's more, to me,                                                  |
| 48:52      | it feels more developer minded                                                 |
| 48:56      | with some of the ways that they just phrase things                             |
| 48:58      | with how you do things and [[Make]]                                            |
| 49:00      | versus [[Zapier]] was like, okay, you want to do that.                         |
| 49:03      | What app do you want to plug into this thing?                                  |
| 49:05      | And what do you want it to do?                                                 |
| 49:07      | So I felt like that was, that was a lot easier for me.                         |
| 49:09      | I mastered [[Zapier]].                                                         |
| 49:10      | And then I, then I started to hit the limits of that.                          |
| 49:13      | And I, I felt this was permission from you guys.                               |
| 49:16      | I remember one time there was an episode where David,                          |
| 49:18      | you were talking about like, think of it like your toolbox.                    |
| 49:20      | You wouldn't just have one kind of, you know,                                  |
| 49:23      | for your woodwork, you wouldn't just have one kind of chisel                   |
| 49:25      | in there.                                                                      |
| 49:26      | You would have multiple different tools that you use.                          |
| 49:28      | So I felt like that made me feel like, okay,                                   |
| 49:30      | I don't have to just do everything in one automation surface.                  |
| 49:33      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 49:34      | And, and I do think you're right about [[Make]] like,                          |
| 49:37      | even like the name sequence, that's a developer term.                          |
| 49:40      | That's not like a normal person term, you know.                                |
| 49:43      | But what are the things that I did struggle with a bit                         |
| 49:45      | with [[Zapier]] is I was using, I mean,                                        |
| 49:48      | some of the automations or Zaps that I'd had in [[Zapier]],                    |
| 49:51      | they'd existed for a really long time.                                         |
| 49:54      | And usually if there's a new version of an action,                             |
| 49:57      | then they'll like migrate it to the next version.                              |
| 49:59      | So they'll take it from one to two to three to four.                           |
| 50:02      | But I had some stuff that just literally couldn't be migrated                  |
| 50:06      | for whatever reason.                                                           |
| 50:08      | And I kind of, I somehow missed the emails from them,                          |
| 50:11      | I guess, about stuff changing.                                                 |
| 50:13      | And the first thing I knew about it was a bunch of my                          |
| 50:15      | automations broke.                                                             |
| 50:16      | And I was like, oh no, this is not good.                                       |
| 50:18      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 50:19      | Fortunately.                                                                   |
| 50:20      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 50:21      | Fortunately, I've actually not had that issue with make.                       |
| 50:23      | And I have been using [[Make]] for a really long time.                         |
| 50:26      | Some of the terminology is very developing.                                    |
| 50:29      | Yes.                                                                           |
| 50:30      | But I do like the fact that on every action,                                   |
| 50:33      | there's a little question mark bubble when you click on,                       |
| 50:36      | so you click on the bubble at the circle with the picture in it.               |
| 50:39      | And then it pops up, you know,                                                 |
| 50:41      | the configuration for that in pop up.                                          |
| 50:44      | And then you can click on the question mark on there                           |
| 50:46      | and it'll open a help documentation for it.                                    |
| 50:48      | So if there's something in there that you don't understand,                    |
| 50:51      | you know, where it's talking about exists or is in text                        |
| 50:55      | or whatever for, you know, the filters,                                        |
| 50:57      | you can just click on the question mark and it'll pop open                     |
| 51:00      | a documentation page, which actually explains how all the                      |
| 51:04      | things work because a lot of the time, you know,                               |
| 51:07      | if there's odd words for things,                                               |
| 51:09      | that's come from the developer and that's just how they name                   |
| 51:12      | things in their API or whatever.                                               |
| 51:14      | So it can be very much just like, you know,                                    |
| 51:17      | you're just talking to the developers API in a prettier                        |
| 51:21      | format or something.                                                           |
| 51:23      | But yeah, it's quite nice as well with, you know,                              |
| 51:25      | it's got things like the text parsing and filtering and so on.                 |
| 51:27      | One thing that's really cool in [[Zapier]],                                    |
| 51:29      | if you haven't played in it lately,                                            |
| 51:31      | they have added an AI right inside of [[Zapier]].                              |
| 51:35      | So before you're even starting a zap,                                          |
| 51:37      | you can type into this thing and say,                                          |
| 51:39      | this is what I'm trying to do.                                                 |
| 51:41      | And then it will try to build out the zap based on what you're                 |
| 51:43      | saying you want it to do.                                                      |
| 51:45      | I don't use it for that because I know pretty much when I'm                    |
| 51:47      | going in there what I want to do.                                              |
| 51:49      | But sometimes if there's not an option to do a particular                      |
| 51:52      | thing that I want to do with an app,                                           |
| 51:55      | what I can, it allows you to do is type in to the AI and say,                  |
| 51:59      | okay, I want to do this API thing,                                             |
| 52:04      | you know, pull this title from this Google doc and then parse                  |
| 52:07      | this out.                                                                      |
| 52:09      | And it will try to work with the API and basically create a                    |
| 52:12      | little custom step for you that you can then use in your zap                   |
| 52:17      | assuming it works and you've told it the right information.                    |
| 52:21      | But I found that to be really cool because it basically lets me                |
| 52:24      | make API calls, which is not something I've been able to                       |
| 52:27      | master, but without having to get that far down the rabbit hole                |
| 52:31      | of programming and development.                                                |
| 52:34      | One other thing I use that's kind of a cheat is I cannot figure                |
| 52:38      | out how I've not been able to figure out and make how to get                   |
| 52:42      | [[Make]] to watch an [[Airtable]] base for records that are updated            |
| 52:47      | only within a certain view.                                                    |
| 52:49      | I'm not sure it's possible, but I've not been able to figure it                |
| 52:52      | out.                                                                           |
| 52:53      | But I know exactly how to get that view that I want to be what                 |
| 52:56      | [[Zapier]] monitors so that it only runs if there's a record that              |
| 52:59      | appears in that view.                                                          |
| 53:01      | And so I'll start that in [[Zapier]] and I'll have it just fire a              |
| 53:04      | [[WebHook\|webhook]] off that goes over to [[Make]] to do the next steps.      |
| 53:07      | And it does the branching and all of that in [[Make]].                         |
| 53:10      | So that's a little bit of a hack that I use.                                   |
| 53:13      | Yeah, yeah, that's one of the things that actually pushed me                   |
| 53:16      | over to [[Make]] from [[Zapier]] previously because I found that               |
| 53:20      | [[Zapier]] had a limitation on their zaps where it would only run              |
| 53:26      | on an air table trigger once ever across all of your                           |
| 53:31      | automations.                                                                   |
| 53:32      | So for example, for the podcast, we would have, you know, I                    |
| 53:36      | wanted an automation when the record was first created and then                |
| 53:40      | what appeared in this view and then what appeared in that view.                |
| 53:43      | And I couldn't do that because it would trigger once on the                    |
| 53:46      | first one and then air table and then [[Zapier]] to prevent you                |
| 53:49      | having the same automation just repeatedly triggering would                    |
| 53:53      | just store the idea of the record and be like, no, we've                       |
| 53:55      | already run automatically once on this.                                        |
| 53:57      | You're done.                                                                   |
| 53:58      | Which, you know, was I completely understand it and I                          |
| 54:02      | respect them for doing that because that makes a lot of                        |
| 54:05      | sense to me that they don't want something just running again                  |
| 54:08      | and again and again and again on the same on the same series                   |
| 54:12      | of records because that that's not going to be good for them                   |
| 54:16      | or good for anybody else.                                                      |
| 54:18      | But yeah, it can be a little tricky.                                           |
| 54:21      | But the, yeah, the good news is, is I think possibly since                     |
| 54:25      | she last looked at Kim, the [[Make]] has updated their [[Airtable]]            |
| 54:29      | trigger for watch records and there is now a the option to                     |
| 54:34      | filter for view and you can even trigger for specific fields                   |
| 54:38      | within that so you can say, hey, you know, whenever any                        |
| 54:42      | records appear, limit it to say 10, but they want to be in                     |
| 54:46      | this view and I want to, you know, look at this particular                     |
| 54:49      | field or even filter with a formula if you want to go                          |
| 54:52      | crazy with it.                                                                 |
| 54:53      | But you can also just be keep it keep it simple as well,                       |
| 54:56      | which is nice.                                                                 |
| 54:57      | So.                                                                            |
| 54:58      | Nice.                                                                          |
| 54:59      | Well, I feel like this is an evolving part of automation is                    |
| 55:02      | the online tools, but they've come a long way and just                         |
| 55:06      | listening to the two of you talk, I think, Rose, we've                         |
| 55:08      | probably got to come back and look at some of them again                       |
| 55:11      | for the show because there is a lot you can do with this                       |
| 55:14      | and like Kim's day job, you know, she's helping all these                      |
| 55:18      | folks with their businesses.                                                   |
| 55:20      | I'm guessing the businesses largely run on online services                     |
| 55:23      | and online automation is the key to that.                                      |
| 55:27      | Yeah.                                                                          |
| 55:28      | Either way, Kim, Caloca-Madden, thank you so much for coming                   |
| 55:31      | on.                                                                            |
| 55:32      | We got through about 25% of the stuff you gave us for the                      |
| 55:35      | show.                                                                          |
| 55:36      | So I guess that means we'll have to get you back someday.                      |

| 55:52      | So those are pretty much the only two.                                         |
| 55:54      | Okay.                                                                          |
| 55:55      | Fair enough.                                                                   |
| 55:56      | Nice.                                                                          |

| 56:17      | points me to the forum for one of my podcasts.                                 |
| 56:20      | I love that.                                                                   |
| 56:21      | I love when it does that.                                                      |
