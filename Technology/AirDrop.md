# Overview
AirDrop is a feature on [[Apple]] devices that allows users to easily share files, photos, and other data with nearby [[Apple]] devices. It uses a combination of [[Bluetooth]] and Wi-Fi technology to create a peer-to-peer connection between devices, allowing for fast and secure file transfers without the need for an internet connection.

# How AirDrop Works
AirDrop uses both [[Bluetooth]] and Wi-Fi technology to establish a direct connection between two [[Apple]] devices. When a user selects the files they want to share and chooses the recipient device, AirDrop creates a secure connection between the two devices using [[Bluetooth]]. Once the connection is established, AirDrop switches to a Wi-Fi connection for faster data transfer speeds.

# Privacy and Security
AirDrop uses encryption to secure file transfers between devices, ensuring that sensitive information is not intercepted by unauthorised users. Users have the option to restrict AirDrop to only receive files from contacts or turn off AirDrop completely to prevent unwanted file transfers.

> [!INFO]- Encryption
> AirDrop uses a combination of encryption techniques to secure file transfers between devices. Specifically, AirDrop uses a mix of AES ([[Advanced Encryption Standard]]) encryption and ECC ([[Elliptic Curve Cryptography]]) key exchange to protect the transferred data.
>
> AES encryption is a symmetric encryption algorithm that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the data being transferred. ECC key exchange, on the other hand, is used to securely establish a connection between the devices and exchange the encryption keys.
>
> By using these encryption techniques, AirDrop ensures that the transferred files remain secure and protected from unauthorised access during the transfer process.

# Compatibility
AirDrop is available on iPhone 5 and later, iPad (4th generation) and later, iPad mini, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, and Macs running OS X Yosemite or later.
