# Overview
IFTTT (If This Then That) is a powerful automation platform that allows users to connect different web applications and devices together through simple conditional statements. By creating "Applets" based on triggers and actions, users can automate tasks, streamline workflows, and integrate various services seamlessly.

The service operates with a freemium model that offers only a small number of applets (previously referred to as "recipes"), with the paid for "Pro" tiers offering more applets, multiple actions, additional triggers and actions, greater performance and with the "Pro+" tier, access to additional tools.
