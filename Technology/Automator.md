# Overview
Automator is a Mac application that allows users to automate repetitive tasks by creating workflows.

- Workflows can be saved as a number of types:
	- **Workflow** - Workflows can be run from within Automator.
	- **Application** - Applications are self-running workflows. Any files or folders dropped onto an Application will be used as input to the workflow.
	- **Quick Action** -Quick Actions are workflows that may be added to Finder, Touch Bar and the Services menu. You can manage Quick Actions in System Settings.
	- **Print Plugin** - Print plugins are workflows that are available in the print dialogue. They accept PDF versions of the document being printed.
	- **Folder Action** - Folder Actions are workflows that are attached to a folder in the Finder. Items added to the folder cause the workflow to run and are used as input to the workflow.
	- **Calendar Alarm** - Calendar Alarms are workflows that are run when triggered by an event in Calendar. They receive no input.
	- **Image Capture Plugin** - Image Capture plugins are workflows that are available in Image Capture. They receive image files as input.
	- **Dictation Command** - Dictation Commands are workflows that are run when triggered by Dictation. They receive no input.
