# Overview
The Apple Pencil is a versatile and precise stylus designed for use with [[Apple|Apple's]] iPad tablets. It enables users to write, draw, and interact with their device in ways that are similar to using a traditional pencil or pen on paper. To date, the Apple Pencil is mostly popular among artists, designers, and students taking handwritten notes.

When using an Apple Pencil, the iPad can detect the pressure, angle, and position of the stylus, allowing for a wide range of creative and functional applications.

# History
The first-generation Apple Pencil was unveiled in September 2015 alongside the iPad Pro. It marked [[Apple|Apple's]] entry into the digital stylus market (after Steve Jobs pointedly (pun intended) snubbed styluses at the release of the iPhone), offering high precision and a seamless user experience. The first-generation Pencil charged through the iPad's Lightning port, which some found cumbersome.

In 2018, [[Apple]] released the second-generation Apple Pencil. This updated model supported the newer iPad Pro models, introduced a matte finish for better grip, and featured wireless charging through a magnetic attachment to the side of the iPad range introduced at that time. Additionally, the second-generation Pencil included a double-tap feature that allowed users to switch tools, like moving from a pencil to an eraser, adding to its convenience.

As of May 2024, [[Apple]] has released the latest updates to the Apple Pencil with the *Apple Pencil Pro*. These updates include further improvements in precision, reduced latency, and enhanced pressure sensitivity, as well as "barrel roll" and "squeeze" triggers. It also includes haptic feedback and tracking via the [[Find My]] app.
