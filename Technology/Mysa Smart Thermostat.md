# Overview
The Mysa Smart Thermostat is a modern device designed to control the temperature in your home more efficiently using advanced technology. Unlike traditional thermostats, which you manually set to a specific temperature, the Mysa Smart Thermostat can be controlled through a smartphone app, meaning you can adjust the temperature remotely. 

One of the key features of the Mysa Smart Thermostat is it can learn your heating preferences. It does this by analysing your daily routines and adjusting the temperature accordingly. For example, it can lower the heat when you leave for work and raise it just before you get home, ensuring your house is warm when you need it to be.

The Mysa Smart Thermostat is also compatible with various smart home ecosystems like [[Amazon Alexa,]] [[Google Assistant]], and [[HomeKit|Apple HomeKit]]. This means you can control your thermostat with voice commands or integrate it with other smart home devices for a seamless experience. 

Furthermore, Mysa provides energy usage reports, which help you understand your heating consumption and make more informed decisions about how to manage your energy use more effectively.
