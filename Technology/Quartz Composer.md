# Overview
Quartz Composer is a visual programming application developed by [[Apple]], designed for processing and rendering graphical data. It allows users to create compositions by linking patches to manipulate images, video, and other media in real-time. The application is particularly useful for designers, artists, and developers looking to prototype user interfaceI elements, create live graphics, or build interactive visual effects.

# Operating Systems
- macOS

# Features
- **Visual Programming Interface** - utilises a node-based approach for processing and rendering media.
- **Real-Time Rendering** - create and manipulate graphics in real-time.
- **Graphical Patches** - wide array of pre-built components for easier composition.
- **3D and 2D Graphics Support** - handle both 2D and 3D assets seamlessly.
- **Core Image, Video, and Audio Integration** - utilise powerful processing filters.
- **Custom Patches** - create custom patches (routines/steps) if built-in ones are insufficient.
- **Kinect Support** - use motion-sensing input for interactive installations.
